Hi All

Many of you will have seen this recent press release, but for those who
haven't:
http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificdata.html

This ties in with a recent blog post on doing science with open data, from
Tom Heath at the Open Data Institute, looking at the questions
* What are the implications of 'doing science' with open data?
* What changes are required in how we approach scientific methods and
findings based on open data?

Your thoughts and comments welcome!

NPG to launch Scientific Data to help scientists publish and reuse research
data

Nature Publishing Group (NPG) today is pleased to announce the Spring 2014
launch of Scientific Data. Open for submissions this autumn, Scientific Data is
a new open-access, online-only platform for the publication of descriptions
of scientifically valuable datasets. Scientific Data will initially focus
on experimental datasets from the life, biomedical and environmental
science communities with future plans to expand to other fields in the
natural sciences.

Scientific Data will introduce and publish a new type of content called
Data Descriptors: peer-reviewed, scientific publications that provide
detailed descriptions of experimental and observational datasets. Data
Descriptors will be a combination of traditional scientific publication
content and structured information curated in-house, and are designed to
maximize reuse and enable searching, linking and data mining. Data
Descriptors may be associated with articles from a broad range of journals.

"Over recent years researchers, funders and learned societies alike have
been calling for new ways to make scientific research, and research data,
more available, reusable and reproducible," says Jason Wilde, Nature
Publishing Group Business Development Director. "Scientific Data's central
mission is to help foster the sharing and re-use of the data underpinning
scientific research."

"Scientific Data will allow for the formal peer-review, publication and
citation of data sets and will provide a real opportunity to promote open
data and promote the re-use of data held by NERC and other research
organisations," says Mark Thorley, Head of Science Information at the
Natural Environment Research Council and Chair of the Research Councils UK
Research Outputs Network.

Scientific Data gives credit through a citable publication, for depositing
and sharing research data. Data Description will be accessible and
searchable via the Scientific Data online data platform, under a Creative
Commons license. The actual data files will be stored in one or more
public, community-recognized systems. The full release of Data Description
and associated data will be verified as part of the peer-review process.
Where a community recognized repository does not exist, Scientific
Data supports
the deposit of the data into a more general repository such as Dryad and
Figshare. All accepted data descriptors will be published on payment of an
article-processing charge (APC) that will also cover the Data Description
curation process.

Susanna-Assunta Sansone, Associate Director and Principal Investigator at
the University of Oxford e-Research Centre, has worked with the NPG team
for the past months to define the Data Description?s concept; she has now
been appointed Honorary Academic Editor of Scientific Data. She will work
closely with the Advisory Panel which is comprised of senior scientists,
data repository representatives, bio-curators, librarians, and funders who
guide the policies, standards, and editorial scope.

"The ongoing conversation around data curation, sharing and publication has
become increasingly exciting as various organisations have moved to
encourage and in some cases support the sharing and reuse of data in
context," says Honorary Academic Editor Sansone. "To inform the internal
development of Scientific Data, I will continue to stay abreast of the
fast-paced fields of data management and scholarly communication."

This is great news. Perhaps we should put something about this on the main
OKF blog - in particular noting how we hope this will be explicitly
encouraging researchers to publish data openly, as per the Panton
Principles?

It's not all great news...

They're doing their usual NPG quirk of charging more if the
author chooses to publish under CC BY rather than CC BY-NC (they're
offering a 'choice' of licences).
see http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/open-access/

?585 for more restrictive licencing & ?650 for CC BY.
This will of course help authors to choose the cheaper more restrictive
option :(

I've blogged about this before:
http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/11/07/gold-oa-pricewatch/

There's also no absolute guarantee the data will be open data as per
http://opendefinition.org/ either. The data will go to appropriate
community databases in some instances, and some of these may not be open.


So, yes it's good that Nature care about data, and may offer some of it as
open data - but unfortunately I think it's quite likely that it won't all
be open, and there are better more open, less expensive data journals out
there.

Best,

Ross

RIght. Nature are leaping onto an already-solved problem, offering an
inferior and more expensive solution. Not today, thank you!

the -BY option is more expensive There seems to be no justification for
this other than commercial interests of Nature. If tthe scientific
community (Wellcome, NIH, NSF, RCUK, etc.) is arguing for CC-BY then it's
irresponsible (at best) for NPG to do otherwise.

I am with Ross.

Why wouldn't I just put my data in figshare or Dryad and be done with it? Creating these "Data Descriptors" seems like inventing a new kind of publication that wasn't necessarily needed. And the differential pricing for different licenses is just goofy signifying god knows what -- are different licenses worth different amounts? This sends just the wrong kind of message.

Hi Ross and Puneet,

good to see discussion; I am happy also to collect feedback, given that 
my role is also to provide an outward facing side to accelerate the 
communication.

Hi Ross, just to point out this text too: "Metadata in the Data 
Descriptors will be made available under the CC0 protocol to promote 
maximum reuse." (http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/open-access/)
The Data Descriptors (see 
http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/for-authors/data-descriptor-content-and-submission/) 
will consist of both traditional narrative publication content and 
structured information, including key experimental metadata, that 
describes the dataset in a standardized, searchable format to aide reuse 
and discovery. Wearing my _Un of Oxford's hat_, it is my opinion that 
the structured/searchable information is CC0 and for the more 
traditional narrative content the author is given the choice (but note 
that the ND option is _not_ among these). Scientific Data will work only 
with open community databases; so far Data Dryad and FigShare are indeed 
open.

Hi Puneet, just to clarify that Data Descriptors are not mean to replace 
e.g. DataCite metadata for traditional articles; but are meant to 
describe the experimental steps. There are many many 
(researchers-driven) community standardization efforts that want these 
experimental steps richly described and standardized (fyi, see list for 
biosciences at: http://biosharing.org/standards) so that when a dataset 
is shared it can be understood, reused and in principle reproduced. 
Therefore helping publish these experimental descriptors (using 
community-0standrads as much as possible) is addressing a real need.

Btw, for those attending the http://rigourandopenness.org/ I will be 
there for more discussion.

Thanks,
Susanna

Yes, any discussion of this should definitely mention the solutions which
are already in place like Figshare (and even OKFN's own CKAN/TheDataHub).
 Highlighting the growing recognition of the importance of data publishing
would be a useful blog post, but it would be better to survey the landscape
than focus on Nature.

There's also something a little perverse about their idea that to be
"citable" you need to be blessed by a big publishing house. DOIs and even
plain old garden variety URIs are eminently citable.  Of course, what they
mean is "citable in a way that will grant you ivory tower kudos," which
ties back in to the whole altmetrics discussion.

Researchers could be deposited their data in their local repositories at no cost to them; most research institutions already have the repositories, so this is a bit of extra work / computer space but in most cases not much more. The peer review as usual will be done by researchers at no cost to the publisher. Publishers moving into this arena on a for-pay basis is not great news. 

This whole system - free gifting of academic work in the form of research results and reviewing - rests on the assumption of secure academic positions at universities. What impact will trends such as MOOCs and automatic grading have on this system? 

If we move forward towards transitioning scholarly communication to open access without addressing this question, are we in effect killing the goose that is laying those golden eggs?

best,

Susanna,

Thank you for your comments.  It is indeed welcome that metadata are
provided under CC0, just as Nature has done with metadata for it's other
publications [1].  Such efforts deserve applause as an example to other
publishers; and it is telling that it seems we must look
to business-driven publishers (Nature, PeerJ) rather than our own
scientific societies (AAAS?) for such innovation.  The perverse incentives
in licensing costs that Ross draws attention to are perhaps the sad price
we pay for that.

I was wondering if you or others might comment in any greater length upon
Tom's question about "citable".  We hear frequently how a DOI makes
something "citable".  Journals have their own requirements about what can
and cannot be "cited" -- perhaps they are driven by what sources are or
aren't indexed by Thompson Reuters or others?  For instance, it is curious
that Nature will frequently provide links in articles, but these are not
indexed as citations.  Who controls what is "citable" - the DOI providers?
the citation counters? the journal? the researchers themselves?

Data, charts, and word versions of my latest Dramatic Growth of Open Access issue are posted in the SFU SUMMIT here:
http://summit.sfu.ca/item/12645

Cite away!

This took me seconds, costs nothing at all to me, saves me time as compared with working with a charging publisher (just upload, no fiddling with payment), and saves the university $ that could go towards actually paying scholars to do the work.

At 600GBP ($935 Cdn), a hundred datasets like this would cost $93,500 - or a decent salary for a junior to mid career academic. It's about time we started to connect the dots in this way - more money flowing from universities to commercial entities means less money for the actual work of the university, less for faculty salaries and to support students.

Such efforts deserve applause as an example to other publishers; and it is telling that it seems we must look to business-driven publishers (Nature, PeerJ) rather than our own scientific societies (AAAS?) for such innovation.  The perverse incentives in licensing costs that Ross draws attention to are perhaps the sad price we pay for that.

Journals have their own requirements about what can and cannot be "cited" -- perhaps they are driven by what sources are or aren't indexed by Thompson Reuters or others?  For instance, it is curious that Nature will frequently provide links in articles, but these are not indexed as citations.  Who controls what is "citable" - the DOI providers? the citation counters? the journal? the researchers themselves?

The author is given strong financial incentive to choose the NC option. as the -BY option is more expensive There seems to be no justification for this other than commercial interests of Nature.

Comment:
 
The Wellcome Trust, NIH, NSF, RCUK, etc., is the funding agency community, not the scientific community. There are some scientists arguing for CC-BY, but what little evidence we have on this suggests that the majority prefer more restrictive licenses - details and links here:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/04/attitudes-and-values-regarding.html

This is not to say that I support NPG on this. The license should be the author's, not the publishers, in my opinion. In other words, NC should mean "no blanket commercial rights granted to any third party", not "commercial rights reserved by NPG". Requests for commercial uses should go to the author, not the publisher, with "commercial" understood to be limited to resale of the content of the work per se. For example, if someone pays to print an article they might well pay for the printing service. This is not commercial use if no royalty is collected for the work.

Because the Nature 6-month embargo is sufficient to meet the terms of OA policies, my suggestion to NPG would be to offer authors the choice of any CC license, not make any distinction in price, and encourage authors to rely on the green method to participate.

Because I believe that in scientific publishing there is an implied
commitment from both sides to behave in a mututally constructive manner. If
you argue that the morals and practices of STM publishers should emulate
banks, energy companies, etc  in trying to make as much money as possible,
creating confusion, and offering flawed deals then I concede your argument.

I have published for years with publishers who behave in a reasonable
manner (BMC, PLoS) who offer CC-BY publication without prevarication and
confusion. They label their products coherently. Meanwhile the mainstream
publishers are sowing confusion and actively fighting and lobbying against
us. Many publishers have argued against content-mining, for example and
CC-NC is deliberately used to prevent it.

Remember that this is an asymmetric deal. Almost all the publishers' value
is GIVEN by academia. It is responsible to give reasonable value in return,
not try to grab more.

Yes,  you probably think I'm looking back to a golden age (which never
existed). But if STM publishing has descended to a dog-eat-dog fight we are
not serving the people of the world.

I shall be blogging on this.


Personally, I think it would be extraordinarily unlikely for all parties in

Can you expand on why you believe this?

Personally, I think it would be extraordinarily unlikely for all parties in
a multi-party negotiation to have their interests perfectly aligned.
 Typically each party argues for their own interest.

Umm, I don't think I argued anything remotely close to that.  It was a
simply a question.

I don't see how working towards a mutually agreeable outcome necessarily
entails walking in lockstep and being in 100% agreement on all things.
 Everyone has different values and viewpoints, even within the scientific
community.  Look at how different the values are from funders and
researchers, or even among the researchers themselves.

Hi folks,

This is the second half of the monster update from two weeks ago, as well
as some new content added over the fortnight.

As always, if you know of works under public copyright licences (and,
particularly, under free/libre/open licences) you can add them to the wiki
yourself or email me and I?ll add them. The same is also true for
free/libre/open projects that are available for sale or are in the process
of being crowdfunded, which I tweet about using the hashtag
#FundFreeCulture.
#FundFreeCultureGeary
<http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/geary-a-beautiful-modern-open-source-email-client?c=home>is
an open source email client. ($24,950 of $100,000; 12 days remain)

Monster Tome <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/monstertome/monster-tome>is
a project to create 20 public domain artworks of unusual monsters
suggested by the backers. ($295 of $4,300; 18 days to go)

The OpenShot Video
Editor<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/421164014/openshot-video-editor-for-windows-mac-and-linux>has
shot through its goal, and has some stretch goals. ($31,740 of
$20,000;
4 days remain)

Save the Public Domain Review!
<http://publicdomainreview.org/support/>($14,409 of $20,000; 17 days
to go)

Justin, the creator of a free culture boardgame called To the Barricades,
is asking for support to help him take art
classes<http://blackflaggames.org/free-culture-patronage/>? and will
create art in exchange. (free culture or free software licences
of your choosing)

The Free Software Foundation is still running a membership
drive.<http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/14uvro/the_free_software_foundation_needs_your_support/>They
made their $350,000 goal, but are still looking for about a hundred
new members.

It may surprise you to learn that the open source Death
Star<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/461687407/kickstarter-open-source-death-star>project
did not raise its ?20,000,000 goal.

Hey,

The Open Research Data Handbook - a collaborative and volunteer-led guide
to Open Research Data practices - is beginning to take shape. We?ll be
asking for comment on the first few chapters soon.

We now need your help to gather *concrete case studies* which detail your
experiences of working with Open Research Data. Specifically, we are
looking for:
* Stories of the benefits you have seen as a result of Open Research Data
practices
* Challenges you have faced in open research, and how you overcame them
* Case studies of tools you have used to share research data or to make it
openly available
* Examples of how failing to follow open research practices has hindered
the progress of research (including but not limited to science)
* ... More ideas from you!

Case studies should be around 200-500 words long. They should be concrete,
based on real experiences, and should focus on one specific angle of open
research data (you can submit more than one study!).

To find out more and register your interest, please visit this blog post
and form<http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/09/open-research-data-handbook-call-for-case-studies/>
.

As we are keen to gather studies from diverse groups, please do circulate
this email to friends, colleagues and any relevant mailing lists.

We also welcome volunteers to help with drafting and editing the book. To
contact the team directly, please email researchhandbook at okfn.org.

We look forward to reading your open research data stories!

All the best,
Michelle (from the Open Research Data Handbook team)

Oxford Open Science
Oxford e-Research Centre, 7 Keble Road, 19:00-20:30

Join us for informal discussion on open science in a digital age. Maybe
you're looking at ways to share scientific data more effectively, planning
a project involving citizen crowd sourcing, want to make your research as
accessible as possible or maybe you're just interested in how openness and
transparency could change the way we do science, come along and explore.

Our first session of the year will introduce the way in which the web
changes how we measure the impact of our research.

Dear all,

It is a great pleasure for me to announce that the Open & Citizen Science
workgroup at OKF France launched this morning :) The announcement -- in
French, naturally -- is here:
http://fr.okfn.org/2013/04/16/lancement-du-groupe-de-travail-science-ouverte-et-citoyenne/

A few projects have volunteered to join forces (e.g., some here will
remember WAXScience, the gender and science student project from Paris).

An excellent start of the group is also the fact that it (and OKF France as
a whole) is a partner of the NASA Space Apps Challenges -- Paris event
(where I am leading the 'Citizen Science' challenges :) ).

Talk soon,
Rayna

Excellent!
We very much look forward to hearing about WAX - presented at the OKF
crowdsourcing hackathon a month ago. It's a simple clever idea (scanning
FLICKR to count the gender ratio in photos of science activities)

For more about WAX-science see their blog here:
http://waxscience.blogspot.co.uk/

and their Twitter here: https://twitter.com/waxscience

It's still very early days for this project. So we shouldn't expect too
much, too soon. But it's certainly very exciting & very welcome!

Definitely one to watch in 2013

To: "open-economics at lists.okfn.org" <open-economics at lists.okfn.org>


Dear Colleagues,

This project, funded by the EU, may be interesting...
http://recodeproject.eu/

With best wishes,

Thomas

"The Policy RECommendations for Open Access to Research Data in Europe
(RECODE) project will leverage existing networks, communities and projects
to address challenges within the open access and data dissemination and
preservation sector and produce policy recommendations for open access to
research data based on existing good practice.

The open access to research data sector includes several different
networks, initiatives, projects and communities that are fragmented by
discipline, geography, stakeholder category (publishers, academics,
repositories, etc.) as well as other boundaries. Many of these
organisations are already addressing key barriers to open access to
research data, such as stakeholder fragmentation, technical and
infrastructural issues, ethical and legal issues, and state and
institutional policy fragmentation. However, these organisations are often
working in isolation or with limited contact with one another. RECODE will
provide a space for European stakeholders interested in open access to
research data to work together to provide common solutions for these
issues. It will provide over-arching recommendations for a policy framework
to support open access to European research data.

The RECODE partners will identify relevant stakeholders, build upon and
strengthen existing stakeholder engagement mechanisms. It will conduct
studies of good practice and exchange good practice principles with
relevant stakeholders and institutions during networking activities. The
RECODE project will culminate in a series of policy recommendations for
open access to research data targeted at different stakeholders and
policy-makers."

Hi all,

Over the last couple of days, Chris Gutteridge and I have been writing
about how to counter concerns about opening up data:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDtHpnIDTY_G32EMJniXaOGBufjHCCk4VC9WGOf7jK4

More relevant to this list, Carly Strasser of the Data Pub blog followed
up with her own post, looking at these issues from more of an Open
Science and research data perspective:

http://datapub.cdlib.org/closed-data-excuses-excuses/

A very useful read it is, too!


Best regards,

Alex

MDPI is a BOAI-compliant publishers and one of the relatively few such
which publish chemistry. As a result I am using their content for
content-mining (#ami2).

 Up until 2008 they used the CC-NC licence. I wrote to them (and some other
publishers) pointing out the downside of CC-NC.

*Up to 2008 most articles published by MDPI contained the note "? year by
MDPI (http://www.mdpi.org). Reproduction is permitted for noncommercial
purposes". During 2008 MDPI journals started to publish articles under
the Creative
Commons Attribution License
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>[image:
external link]. However, all articles published by MDPI before and during
2008 should be considered as released under the same Creative Commons
Attribution License since 2008.*

So it's worth writing to CC-NC publishers - many of whom are not aware of
the downsides. Of course some of the others use CC-NC as a way of
restricting redistribution to try to protect their markets. But we should
still write.

Please, see

http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/04/29/redrawing-the-map-from-access-to-participation/

Worth thinking on the impact this can also have on Wikimedia projects when
it comes to the actual knowledge
divide<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_divide>,
mainly like Wikipedia, which aggregates knowledge in the form of a
encyclopedia through reliable sources.

This reminds me the reason why organizations like Article
19<http://www.article19.org/>were created (private communication with
a friend who worked there), where
a UNESCO report from the 80's already pointed out such divide (I have to
remember the name of the report).

To face this reality is a way for we try to learn what can be done in terms
of metrics on our global projects.

(Although I must tell my biggest concern now is that we from the global
south - or whatever you call it, maybe we could call the big fraction of
the world without access to knowledge - have access to scientific and
educational knowledge.)
