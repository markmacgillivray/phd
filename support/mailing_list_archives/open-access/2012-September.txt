Hi all,

If any of you are still thinking about coming to OKFest, there is an option
to share accommodation... See below!

It's going to be a fantastic week, with an amazing science programme lined
up (everything from the European Commission to Figshare to the World Bank
to Wikimedia and beyond!). Do take a look at:
http://okfestival.org/open-research-and-education/

Cheers,
Laura

To: okfn-volunteers at lists.okfn.org


Dear all,

are there people that did not book an accomodation yet for OKFestival?

We (Pieter Colpaert, Lieven Janssen, Nieke Jahja and Kat Borlongan) would
like to rent an appartment from sunday 16 till saturday 22 and we are
looking for 3 to 4 extra people to stay there and pay a part of the rent.

The appartment:
http://<http://www.redappleapartments.com/helsinki/en/apartmentdetail/view/idapartment/2885/checkin//checkout//guests//bedrooms/>
www.redappleapartments.com<http://www.redappleapartments.com/helsinki/en/apartmentdetail/view/idapartment/2885/checkin//checkout//guests//bedrooms/>
/helsinki/en/apartmentdetail/view/idapartment/2885/checkin//checkout//guests//bedrooms/<http://www.redappleapartments.com/helsinki/en/apartmentdetail/view/idapartment/2885/checkin//checkout//guests//bedrooms/>

The price would be around ?1.584 (+/- ?250 p.p. if we can find enough
people)

Would you be interested to join us and get to know likeminded people?
Please drop me an email asap.

Best Regards,

Lieven Janssen

Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMa0SooXFibtbFAX0N8K3rY5Pj8QEsD2sSYsE+9yFooT3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a final post to warn you that tickets for OKFest are beginning to sell
out! If you haven't yet bought yours, get it here:
http://okfestival.org/early-bird-okfest-tickets/

We have an exciting series of sessions lined up for Open Science and Open
Access, and it would be great to see an equally strong representation of
scientists in the audience.

Highlights include:
** Mat Todd* from the University of Sydney talking about Open Source Drug
Discovery; *
* Carl-Christian Buhr *from the Cabinet of Neelie Kroes leading a workshop
on the Commission's new open access policy;
* Sessions on *Crowdsourcing Data*, *Communicating Science*, *Open Access
in Practice*, *Immediate Access to Raw Data from Experiments* and more,
with a great line up of speakers from the World Bank, Ushahidi, Wikimedia,
FigShare and beyond.

More details on the Science sessions:
http://okfestival.org/open-research-and-education/
And on the wider programme:
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/09/05/okfest-2week-bulletin/

If you can't make the main event, there is also a **FREE** science hackday
in Helsinki on Tuesday 18th. Sign-up here:
http://okfestival.org/open-culture-and-science-hackday/

There are fewer than 100 tickets remaining, so please do share this with
friends, colleagues and around any mailing lists you may be part of. It
would be great to get some more scientists together in the final fortnight!

Kind regards,
Laura

HI all,

Sorry, I am not going to make it. I will catch up on the etherpad later, or
email me with any specific questions.

Have been a bit busy this week with other things, but will be back on the
bibserver / malaria / okfest stuff next week.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: September 12, 2012

CONTACT: Andrea Higginbotham, SPARC, andrea at arl.org; 202-296-2296
Amy Weil, Open Society Foundations, aweil at sorosny.org; 212-548-0381
 
Scientists, Foundations, Libraries, Universities, and Advocates Unite and Issue New Recommendations to Make Research Freely Available to All Online
 
WASHINGTON -- In response to the growing demand to make research free and available to anyone with a computer and an internet connection, a diverse coalition today issued new guidelines (http://www.soros.org/openaccess/boai-10-recommendations) that could usher in huge advances in the sciences, medicine, and health.
 
The recommendations were developed by leaders of the Open Access movement (http://www.soros.org/openaccess/participants), which has worked for the past decade to provide the public with unrestricted, free access to scholarly research?much of which is publicly funded. Making the research publicly available to everyone?free of charge and without most copyright and licensing restrictions?will accelerate scientific research efforts and allow authors to reach a larger number of readers.
 
?The reasons to remove restrictions as far as possible are to share knowledge and accelerate research. Knowledge has always been a public good in a theoretical sense. Open Access makes it a public good in practice,? said professor Peter Suber, director of the Open Access Project at Harvard University and a senior researcher at SPARC (The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition).  
 
The Open Access recommendations include the development of Open Access policies in institutions of higher education and in funding agencies, the open licensing of scholarly works, the development of infrastructure such as Open Access repositories and creating standards of professional conduct for Open Access publishing. The recommendations also establish a new goal of achieving Open Access as the default method for distributing new peer-reviewed research in every field and in every country within ten years? time.
 
?Science and scholarship are activities funded from the public purse because society believes they will lead to a better future in terms of our health, environment, and culture,? said Heather Joseph, executive director of SPARC. ?Anything that maximises the efficacy and efficiency of research benefits every one of us. Open Access is a major tool in that quest. These new recommendations will underpin future developments in communicating the results of research over the next decade.?
 
Today, Open Access is increasingly recognized as a right rather than an abstract ideal. The case for rapid implementation of Open Access continues to grow. Open Access benefits research and researchers; increases the return to taxpayers on their investment in research; and amplifies the social value of research, funding agencies, and research institutions.
 
The Open Access recommendations are the result of a meeting hosted earlier this year by the Open Society Foundations, on the tenth anniversary of the landmark Budapest Open Access Initiative (http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read), which first defined Open Access.
 
?Foundations rarely have the good fortune to be actively present at the birth of a world-wide movement that fundamentally changes the rules of the game and provides immediate benefit to the world,? said Istv?n R?v, director of the Open Society Archives and a member of the Open Society Foundations Global Board. ?This is what happened when the Open Society Foundations initiated a meeting at the end of 2001 that gave birth to the Open Access movement.?
 
###
 
SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition), with SPARC Europe and SPARC Japan, is an international alliance of more than 800 academic and research libraries working to create a more open system of scholarly communication. SPARC?s advocacy, educational, and publisher partnership programs encourage expanded dissemination of research. SPARC is on the Web at http://www.arl.org/sparc.
 
The Open Society Foundations work to build vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable to their citizens. Working with local communities in more than 100 countries, the Open Society Foundations support justice and human rights, freedom of expression, and access to public health and education. The Open Society Foundations is on the Web at http://www.soros.org.

This is tremendous. (I'm not dreaming?) They have reasserted the centrality
of BOAI. This is exactly what is required - everything else follows. This
is the only effective definition of OA libre.

And I have spent a whole day having to challenge Stevan Harnad at the
Digital Research 2012 meeting (and, immodestly) I think the proper BOAI
approach prevailed.

Maybe the OKF should create something that helps reinforce the BOAI
declaration.

BTW I am continuing to pickup vibes that Panton, Open Biblio principles and
Open Content Manifesto are gathering interest. Perhaps we should package
these with OKD and promote the universality of the philosophy. Sophie K has
made Panton postcards and maybe we could create siblilngs where we list the
various definitions

Hi,

For those of you streaming in from afar, a session on crowdsourcing data
for development is kicking off right now. This is a collaborative effort
from the Open Science and Open Development stream, and is already off to a
great start!

Live-stream here: http://okfestival.org/streams/inspire-meeting-room/

Plus a big event of today is the interactive discussion with Carl-Christian
Buhr from the cabinet of Neelie Kroes at the European Commission. That will
take place at 4pm in Helsinki (UTC+3).

It will be live-streamed here: http://okfestival.org/streams/meet-8th-floor/

I am trying to stay on top of Twitter. If you're streaming in and want to
tweet at me (@Newmanlk), I can try to ask questions on your behalf! Other
people to follow for news and updates include @jenny_molloy,
@petermurrayrust, @rmounce and @scilib.

More soon! :)

J.


---------- Forwarded message ----------


The Public Knowledge Project (PKP) is very pleased to announce the 1.0
(Beta) release of Open Monograph Press (OMP).  OMP is an open source
software platform for managing the editorial workflow required to see
monographs, edited volumes, and scholarly editions through internal
and external review, editing, cataloguing, production, and
publication. OMP will operate, as well, as a press website with
catalog, distribution, and sales capacities.

OMP has been developed to support a format that remains critical to
the advancement of learning.  John Willinsky, Khosla Family Professor
of Education at Stanford University, Distinguished Scholar in
Residence at SFU Library and Professor (Limited Term) in Publishing
Studies at Simon Fraser University, and founding Director of PKP,
stated, "We have worked hard to create a virtual
publishing-house-in-a-box, which, in the hands of publishers and
scholars, will give life to a new generation of learned books."

OMP is designed to assist university presses, learned societies, and
scholar-publishers interested in publishing scholarly books in
print-on-demand and multiple electronic formats, whether on an open
access or purchase basis. OMP is intended to:

- Handle edited volumes, with different authors for each chapter;
- Involve editors, authors, reviewers, designers, indexers, and others
in book production;
- See submission through multiple rounds of both internal and external reviews;
- Utilize industry standard ONIX for bookseller metadata requirements
(e.g., Amazon);
- Create document libraries for submissions, recording contracts,
permissions, etc.;
- Handle thumbnail covers in Catalog, as well as Spotlight features; and
- Enable Series Editors to see books through review to publication.

OMP is a completely new software module from the Public Knowledge
Project. It has been developed from the ground up to take advantage of
Web 2.0 technologies.  It will also provide the framework for the
redevelopment of OJS - now used by more journals than any other
software in the world - and other PKP software to a more contemporary
software architecture based on a common PKP Web Application Library.
Alec Smecher, PKP's Lead Developer, noted: "With OCS and OJS, we
developed workflow tools to facilitate publishing of short- and
medium-form content with academic rigor. With OMP, we have broadened
these tools to support monograph-length content and written a
cutting-edge user interface to manage it. By doing so with code shared
by all applications via the Web Application Library, we ensure that
all of our applications will benefit rapidly from this work."

As part of OMP's release strategy, PKP will be working closely with
several early adopters who will use OMP in a production environment.
They will provide feedback in the coming months on OMP in the following
areas:

- Taking a production-destined publication through the entire workflow
- Utilization of ONIX support and other new functional areas
- User interface and usability review
- Translating and using the software in a multilingual context

OMP's early adopters represent a variety of use cases including an
established university press; a scholarly publishing group; an
academic department; and an academic library providing hosting
services.

OMP was designed in consultation with and support from Athabasca
University Press (http://www.aupress.ca/), which has kindly permitted
us to use their books and content to populate a presentation site of
OMP (http://pkp.sfu.ca/omp/presentation/). OMP has been built with
support from the Simon Fraser University Library, SFU Canadian Centre
for Studies in Publishing, Canadian Foundation for Innovation, Alfred
P.
Sloan Foundation, and Stanford University. Moving forward, it is
anticipated that OMP will continue to be enhanced with a particular
focus on pre- and post-publication support.

As with all PKP software, OMP can be downloaded for free and installed
on a local webserver or can be hosted by PKP Publishing Services
(https://pkpservices.sfu.ca/).  More information about OMP, including
links to documentation, can be found on the PKP website at:

We didn't get much of a chance to discuss it at OKFest (at least, I
didn't!), but I have added Open Access week to the agenda for the next WG
call.

The next Open Science working group call is taking place this Wednesday
(26th Sept) at 17:30 UTC (18:30 BST, 19:30 CEST etc).

The etherpad is here: http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-26Sep2012

Perhaps the Open Access group can also discuss it on their next call on
Friday?

Cheers,
Laura

Hi All

If you want to combine the malaria bib data with some prevalence data (for
mapping Ben O'Steen style for example), the following dataset has just been
released.

 Hi Jennie,****

Sorry to miss your session at the Digital Research meeting last week. I
hear it went well.****

I thought you might like to know that, after 6 months without our

the public at www.map.ox.ac.uk/explorer.****

At the moment about 40,000 survey results can be downloaded while another
10,000 are confidential. Our genetic disorder data has already gone online
in a less sophisticated format and we are hoping to add two new data types
to the explorer in the coming year.****

thanks Jenny.

I am making some big changes to bibserver based on ideas from last week, so
if anyone has a good idea for what we could do with the data Jenny
mentions, please reply now and I will see if we can work it into the next
version.

Great - thanks Mark.

SCOAP3 is CC-BY so maybe that gives us some fresh points on the Mounce
plot. (BTW I showed the plot at UK/EuPMC yesterday.

If they are publishing the same product (copyedited, peer-review
arrangement, PDF , HTML and dead-tree versions) why have they negotiated
different prices with different publishers?

Why does Jagiellonian University only charge $650 for Acta Physica Polonica
B
whilst Elsevier's Nuclear Physics B gets to charge $2000

Does Nuclear Physics B really provide >3 times more added value than a
publication in Acta Physica Polonica B?

N.B. Don't even think about referring to journal impact factors if you want
to answer that question!

If the SCOAP3 community is so well organised and publishes in so few
journals, why does it need more expensive journals? Why can't they just
expand the editorial board and publish everything in Acta Physica Polonica
B and spend the leftover money on something better than giving more profit
to commercial publishers like Elsevier and Springer?

Journals are just vessels for containing research. It doesn't matter if
research is published across 1000 or just 2 or 3 'journals'. As long as we
have appropriate filtering tools (which I think we do have), then we should
be able to find the research we need.

I'm sure this SCOAP3 initiative is a good move for Open Access... but I
can't help thinking it could have been better especially in terms of
spending efficiency.

Impact factors.

Sorry, but we both know it's the truth. It's a stupid truth, but a
true one nevertheless.

A practical reason is that the high-energy particle physics community
is not hermetically sealed off from the rest of the world. Often a HEP
physicist will be in competition with a physicist from a different
field for the same job or grant. So rightly or wrongly HEP physicists
continue to feel the pressure to publish in the fashionable journals.

Yes; but you are thinking about science. Most people also think about
their careers.

(Much, much more on this dichortomy coming soon on SV-POW!, by the way.)

I do of course understand that Nuclear Physics B has a higher Journal
Impact Factor than Acta Physica Polonica B. And so I appreciate Mike's
points and am looking forward to your blog post on this.

BUT, subtly, it doesn't actually answer the question I asked:

*Does Nuclear Physics B really provide >3 times more added value than
a publication in Acta Physica Polonica B?*

The Journal Impact Factor is something unrelated to the intrinsic value of
the services provided by the publishers: copyediting, arranging peer
review, providing typeset HTML, PDF & dead-tree versions. The quality of
work provided by the authors is what generates citations, that drive the
calculation of the JIF. This is NOTHING to do with the publishers and their
vessels for articles (journals), except for the self-reinforcement effect
of articles appearing in high JIF journals, that are *perceived* justly (or
not) to be better to cite than articles in lower JIF journals.

If judging solely on what the publisher adds to the value of the author
submitted works, are the services provided by Nuclear Physics B really
worth >3 times more than that of Acta Physica Polonica B?


I have had a look at articles from both their websites. I encourage others
to do so too. I DO NOT think Nuclear Physics B looks like it is worth >3
times more than Acta Physica Polonica B.

I appreciate the careerism involved and it's supposed reliance on Journal
Impact Factor, but according to this recent Nature piece (
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489177a.html) that may
not be as true as many academics think it is.

Let's not make the excuses for people. This list is here to ask the tough
questions :)

The market says: yes.

If only that were true. Actually, copyediting (when it happens at all)
and arranging peer-review (which is both arranged and carried out by
unpaid volunteers) are not areas where publishers make any significant

The tragedy is, it doesn't actually matter whether it's true or not.
So long as people think it is, they will emasculate their work to get
it into Science or Nature, and they will pay three times as much to be
in Nuclear Physics B as in Acta Physica Polonica B?

In other words, it's all about perception.

Which is probably good news, in the long run, because it means it can
be addressed by education. And also of course by Planck's Principle.

Yes. But you can't then complain if you don't like the answers!

I run into this a lot in the comments on SV-POW!. We're fortunate on
that blog to have an audience made up of more or less equal parts
amateurs, idealistic young early-career professionals, mid-career
professionals seeking advancement, and old pros. It's fascinating to
see the variation in attitudes between (and less often within) these
groups.

I'm hoping the UK market will soon change once the RCUK Open Access mandate
comes in. *Hopefully* although admittedly that is just speculation for now,
there will be some pressure on academics to look at price and openness
rather than just JIF/glory.

Agreed, publishers are mostly selling brand names and prestige associated
with long-distant glories of past publications in the same brand. I was
*hoping* academics might be able to see past this, if not now, then maybe
sometime in the near future.

Likewise I'm not sure I want the entire destruction of the journal system,
that might be too much. But greater focus on prices and REAL services
provided might be nice.

I'm not complaining! Keep it up - I enjoy discussion, and I hope others on
this list benefit from this elucidation of thought processes.

Excellent discussion. At least we can have one on this list - which is what
it's for. (It's impossible to do this on the GOAL list - anyone not in the
Green oligarchy gets blown out of the water.)

IMO there are three things (please criticize) :
* cost
* price
* value

The COST is - in principle - measurable. Any publisher which simply
provided a defined service could publish their costs and indicate whether
they make a profit. But most publishers hide their costs both by secrecy
and bundling products so the cost is rarely known. There are some
indications that for a  journal that generally reviews a paper once and
accepts most submissions the cost is around 250 USD. However for journals
trhat have a high rejection rate the costs are higher. Nature has said that
for an open access journal they would have to charge 6500 GBP == 10000 USD.
I find it difficult to believe this is the cost, even with multiple
rejections and reviews.

The PRICE is what you pay the publisher. In most markets it is either set
by market forces (competition, perceived value, etc) or by regulators or by
some of both. However prices for subscriptions are often secret and
librarians are forced to sign non-disclosure clauses.

The VALUE is what the purchasers (whether authors - gold -or subscribers)
feel the product is worth. A paper in Nature is valued more that one in
J.Cheminformatics (on whose board I am). This is highly subjective and
self-fulfilling.

Normal market forces don't apply for a number of reasons:
* leading brands can often charge whatever they like and people will pay
it. Examples are mineral water, beauty products, fashions, foods, etc.
Prices are are sometimes related to scarcity but seldom to cost.
* people in universities are not normally paying with real money. Most
libraries get subscription income from taxpayers or students. They don't
have to go out on the streets and raise actual money . Academics are even
more insulated - they aren't expected to pay for journal subscriptions out
of their grants (the universities top-slice it).
* publication supports a number of conflicting purposes. Communication,
archival, peer-approval, etc. and also the label of glory in the field. The
latter is what drives the apparent value.
* it's not a zero-sum game. We are in a dysfunctional pseduo-equilibrium
and any unilateral move costs extra for no return. Managed change can only
come from the top. That's what RCUK is trying to do.

My simplistic solution (it won't happen) would be to separate the glory
awarding from the publication. Then communication, etc. could become
commodities under normal market forces . It would also get the publication
completely into the Open arena. And we could have an OSCAR-like process for
deciding the superstars. It oculdn't be worse that what we do at present
with Impact factors for journals decided by non-representative commercial
companies.

But at least we can discuss it freely here.

Hi All,

I also agree that this is an excellent discussion, and well worth having.
For me the physics community is the example of how to do open science.
Their use of Archive.org as repository has not led to decreases in
publications in regular journals. It did show that "filtering after" worked
for physics.
SCOAP3 seemed to me to show a way on how to get OA publishing as the
default method of publishing. I am astonished that the physics community
has negotiated different prices in the way she did.
The argument that high impact journals can ask for and get more money is
indeed a question of perception, and like Ross says this is no function of
value or real cost of publishing. And the enormous profits of many of the
publishers is something we should no longer accept.
We can only advance if we scientists take it on ourselves to determine
where we want to publish and what we are willing to pay for services. But I
am almost  sure that this will not happen without the reshaping of the
whole old school publishing system.
Nevertheless the fact that PLoS, BiomedCentral and other journals are more
and more valued among scientists and citizens, and the fact that the
assured quality of high impact journals is more and more shown to be an
illusion gives me hope,\ The perception of scientists of OA journals is
changing for sure, which could signal the beginning of the end for high
profit old school publishers. Scientists have it in their own hands.
the idea of organizing scientist communities that have firm control over
 publications in their area of expertise still appeals to me as a promising
strategy.
Also the idea of libraries taking on a role of managing information is
something that I find attractive.

I agree with everything you said there, Peter, especially that change has
to come from the top (hopefully informed by pressure from academics and
OKFN). I don't think the destruction of the journal system is too much/ a
bridge too far though, Ross. It's probably the best way to break the
"quality" stranglehold that top-flight journals have.

I'm about to get evangelical, so please excuse me, but it wouldn't be that
hard for a publicly-funded organisation to replace the journal publishing
system with a better and much cheaper alternative/ alternatives that could
deal with the "impact factor determining article worth" problem.

Once the open access mandate comes in, independent online databases will be
able to copy and host a larger proportion of articles published. Hopefully
a database will arise (or Pubmed and its ilk will develop) to do so in a
new universal, better presented, format which includes a discussion system.
This would have an in-built advantage versus the current publishing model
in that it could bring single experiments from different publications that
address the same scientific question together so that they can easily be
compared and discussed online. It would need a good forum system with peer
moderation that positively selects the most interesting comments and
rewards people for making them (like the slashdot.org moderation system).
This would get people engaged in (/addicted to) the "game" of
participation, and hopefully keep them coming back to participate, and
would allow a large amount of editorial responsibility to be taken on by
the community, thus saving money. The databases would need a large
editorial staff, but there's no reason these could not be public employees
(of EMBL/EBI and NCBI in my field, for e.g.) and you'd still need a lot
fewer of them than the traditional system.

If such a system took off, glory could still come from citations, but the
journal in which articles were published would matter less as people would
start to use the universal database to access articles, just for the
discussion system. Hopefully "buzz" about articles would start to be
generated by the discussion rather than the journal's reputation, so that
eventually journals would be irrelevant and publication could be done
direct through the database.

I'm hoping it's just a matter of time, and I have a(nother) fantasy that it
could change the way science is done so that people will publish the
results of single experiments instead of waiting for a "narrative" to
develop, which would be left for reviews, but that's a whole other rant!

But most publishers hide their costs both by secrecy and bundling products so the cost is rarely known. There are some indications that for a  journal that generally reviews a paper once and accepts most submissions the cost is around 250 USD. However for journals trhat have a high rejection rate the costs are higher. Nature has said that for an open access journal they would have to charge 6500 GBP == 10000 USD. I find it difficult to believe this is the cost, even with multiple rejections and reviews.

Isn't this just what's happening? The communication taking place via arXiv, and the 'glory' awarded via the journals in which the material is subsequently published?

YES. It's about time something like this happened - SPARC has been quiet
and I look to them for some guidance. I haven't read the booklet, but
comment on the abstract


? Move the conversation from ?Is It Open Access?? to ?How Open Is It??
? Clarify the definition of OA
? Standardize terminology
? Illustrate a continuum of ?more open? versus ?less open?
? Enable people to compare and contrast publications and policies
? Broaden the understanding of OA to a wider audience

These are all critical. Until recently there was nowhere they could be
discussed without the discussion being destroyed.

But now we have OKF open-access !!

Let's offer this organ to the world and let's finally try to get a decent
discussion going.

This sounds quite like what Cameron Neylon was suggesting a month or two
ago - is this the result, or a separate effort?

Had a quick look. One comment (which I also submitted on the form):

  * "Generous reuse & remixing rights (CC-BY license)" - The allusion
to CC-BY is helpful, but it would also be good if this box explicitly
mentioned OpenDefinition.org as a standard for fully open licenses -
e.g. for cases where there may be bespoke or custom licenses.

At OKFest we had a very successful hackathon looking at what we could
extract from bibliographic data. Michael Bauer (copied) trawled the
BioMedCentral site and has extracted a large amount of bibdata. We plan to
put this in Bibserver.

One idea that we want to do is create ids for each institution mentioned in
the author list, based on the text, e.g.

Unilever Centre, Dep. Of Chemistry
University of Cambridge
CB2 1EW, UK

This would allow us to create facets for institutions, create a list and
browse using Bibserver. (Although we cannot formally uniquify, this is a
much easier problem than authors.

Laurent - I came across GROBID and am keen to re-use, rather than reinvent.

Perhaps we should form an informal group in this technology and coordinate
some of our efforts?

He has already done so, which brought up some issues I am resolving as part
of a re-design anyway. Should be done next week.

Actually we can facet without identifiers. It can be done directly on the
name string. Identifiers just provide us a way to connect different names
for the same thing, but the problem is still the same - we need to identify
that two things are the same in the first place.

I mentioned what we were doing when at UKPMC yesterday and there was

Some quick answers:

Yes this is the first step in what I've been talking to some of you about for the past several months.

Without wishing to re-open old wounds, the OpenDefinition isn't really appropriate in this context as it isn't strong enough as a definition for interoperability of bespoke licences. We're adopting the BOAI original definition alongside the recommendations of BOAI10 here that CC-BY is best practice (for journal *articles*...not really referring strongly to data here) ie share-alike is not "open enough" in this domain.

But feel free to comment!

Point very much taken Cameron. In which case - what about
"OpenDefinition compliant 'attribution style' licensing" which
shouldn't cause interoperability issues?

Or perhaps it isn't worth broadening from CC-BY (as it might have been
a few years ago) as people are much more likely to use CC-BY than to
roll their own, which of course should be encouraged.

My personal view, built on the idea that the key issue is interoperability, is that we should just require CC-BY as the Gold Standard. Much simpler and much less risk of unexpected problems arising due to license incompatibilities downstream. It always bothers me that people *want* a bespoke license. What does this achieve? And what is the motivation? 

So I think working towards a very strong statement of best practice for research/science is valuable and it seems that there is some movement towards CC-BY/ccZero/BSD for content, data and code respectively (code is the least worked out and has the least agreement as yet) as a standard.

Cheers

Cameron

Strong agreement here. There is enormous value in organisations using
CC BY, not only because it's a good licence but because everyone who
cares about such issues already knows what it means. Instant
recognition is very valuable. No-one wants to read pages of legalese
only to emerge on the other side thinking, "Oh, so it's just like CC
BY, then".

That's exactly the direction that the TEI consortium adopted (see http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/access.xml): a combination of CC-BY and BSD-2-clauses.
I guess we could get some institutions follow the trend if we were to go along with a strong statement.

Great. In which case perhaps the chart could just say that stronger OA at
the top should *be* CC-BY, rather than a liberal license like CC-BY? My
comment below re: licensing standard was intended to guard against liberal
interpretations of 'open' - that might include, e.g. NC or ND restrictions.

I spoke to Chris Taggart (Open Corporates) very briefly and in passing
about this at OKFest. My knowledge is imperfect, but as I understand it
part of Open Corporates is about identifying when two (different) entities
are the same - as well as trying to chase up the chain to identify if one
body actually owns another.

He was interested in what we were doing. Would it be worth someone talking
to him directly?

The Open Access movement is still fragmented and lacks a useful neutral
exposition. Its complicate because it is so religious and factional. So any
of my and other attempts to create a discussion are shot down, often with
inaccuracies. There is no useful document giving an idea of the rationale
and opportunities in OA. They are, for example, all predicated on the idea
that there is a 15 billion USD publishing industry, mainly for profit, and
that this is ordained as the optimal and unchanging way to publish.
Journals are still largely sacrosanct. The megajournals will somwhat change
this as will article metrics but who is administering this? T/R decide what
is and what is not an indexable journal and what a citation is. Within this
mess it is very difficult to provide best practice. However a  "neutral"
statement would be extremely valuable.

Data is easier at this stage because (a) most people haven't engaged (b)
there is very little commercial involvement and (c) we already have the
Panton Principles.  We *have* to get the mainstream involved in this -
especially funders. The almost total indifference of mainstream publishers
(BMC, PLoS? excepted)  to Panton, open Biblio principles and Open Content
Mining means we have a great deal of advocacy to do. But IMO this is
undoubtedly the way that we in OKF should go. Get clear principles, get the
community to discuss, refine them and then aggressively advocate. BOAI
is/was a great document, but the Harnadistas should never have been allowed
to corrupt it. And uncertainty and division is worth huge amounts to
commerce, who then make things worse if unconstrained.

Code. The only distinction for me is whether or not to allow viral
copyleft. My impression is that many people now deliberately choose one or
the other. I would not use GPL as I wish industry to use and re-use my
code. (I have to bite my lip when I see the distortions in chemistry from
some industry who rebadge and re-use without permission but the public/open
domain has few effective champions).  I can't say I would wish to require
BSD and forbid GPL and I think it's too late for that. And within the
BSD-like family you really have to be a lawyer to see al the ramifications.
I have personally had considerable problems being pressured to relicence my
LGPL (sic) code as BSD when a company (nameless here) was vitrioloc about
the Blue Obelisk but demanded a change of licence because it made static
linking easier for them. BTW I didn't choose LGPL - my code was part of a
larger system.

We *have* to insist on CC-BY for articles. It's simple and the good thing
is that funders understand and support it. We should create a simple
statement for what we want an article to be. Avoid all use of Green and
Gold. Kill the CC-NC serpent. I think this would be acceptable to current
CC-BY publishers.I think it would help to sway CC-not-quite-libre and
homebrewed licences. We would avoid all mention of fees etc.

Something like:
"For scientific communication and re-use of information it is essential to
license the article and all copies specifically and clearly. Terms such as
'open Access' should be avoided".
"The licence must explicitly allow use, reuse and redistribution consistent
with BOAI. We strongly recommend CC-BY (without the SA variant).
Non-commercial restrictions should be avoided at all costs"
"Where 'publications' consist of several components it is essential that
all carry a licence. In some cases (e.g. data-rich) it may be appropriate
to licence these as CC0 or PDDL".

IOW we come up with a Panton approach to scholarly articles. I think this
could now be compelling, engaging and for all except those with entrenched
minds valuable and adoptable.

I've got quite excited about this!

Subject: [Open-access] A short Science/Open Access based review of
	OKFestival 2012
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEx7TojJ8RqDJdSWTsQudEV4Vgf9D4ieJhORqFmFDpbOxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

just to let you know, I've written a short summary of my experience at
OKFestival 2012 here:
http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/09/26/the-open-knowledge-festival-2012-helsinki-some-notes/

It's not an exhaustive recap of everything I saw - there were simply too
many excellent talks and hack events to do that, inevitably I have had to
leave some things out. But hopefully it might provide an interesting post
to point to with a couple of embedded videos of the Science / Open Access
talks.


Best,

Ross
