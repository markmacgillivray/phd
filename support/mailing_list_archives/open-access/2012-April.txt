I may be wrong, but in the described situation, wouldn't any URL meet the
requirements?

I think the question here is how to exchange "citations" and build up the graph. I've been involved in a project (Webtracks) which seeks to build a mechanism for exchange of citations between repositories. There is an implementation available but this just provides a protocol and triplestore for holding the incoming and outgoing citations. What it doesn't do is scan documents/resources for things that might be citations as this is a repository specific issue.

> I may be wrong, but in the described situation, wouldn't any URL meet the requirements?

Yes,  in principle a dereferenceable URL (ideally with some semantic weight to it in the link) is sufficient to encode the information. But I think the original question was whether there are tools that help to record, traverse, and build up the graph?

Cheers

Cameron

Crossref is not only a particular technology but also a business model that
involves the publishers providing citation information. I don't know the
details but I suspect publishers use it because they get greater exposure.
An Open implementation might have this attraction for publishers but it
would be seen as a threat by publishers who aggregate and sell raw citation
material and also downstream services.

There are therefore at least two separate questions:

   - how do we get Open citation data
   - how do we build the technology to make it useful

I think the first is the hardest - I am not sure whether thisw was involved
in the original question (which used Crossref as an example)

Fantastic!

Thanks Jessy, some excellent suggestions and glad to see that someone had
beaten me to it and added them to the etherpad already :)

I've noticed a couple of others adding to the etherpad as well - absolutely
great, keep the ideas coming! Be as creative as you like, we can deal with
the details later ;) Etherpad here: http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

This is looking really good, thank you everyone for your contributions and
enthusiasm!

Cheers,
Laura

Hi,

I am following this discussion with great interest.
The ideas that are described concerning Escience collaborating communities
match the views that I have expressed in my blog on open science
communities<http://access.okfn.org/2012/03/20/scientific-social-networks-are-the-future-of-science/>on
access.okfn.org.
In my view we could build such an infrastructure using the @ccess
communities proposed on our website and possibly an @ccess foundation
funded by external parties lke EU, Welcome, Gates Foundation etc.
These ideas are part of the strategy behind the @ccess initiative.

Not sure whether this has already been posted here, but PLoS Comp Biol
now have a manuscript track for articles destined for the English
Wikipedia:

I blogged about it at

Hi Egon,

the articles are being written in accordance (as much as is feasible
at least) with the guidelines of both the journal and the English
Wikipedia. That includes notability criteria and thus the choice of
the article's scope in the first place. We will also invite
WikiProject Computational Biology to review the draft (which is public
on a CC BY-licensed MediaWiki instance).

So while we cannot exclude that such articles will be the subject of
deletion discussions, the probability for that to happen is lower than
for the average science article on the English Wikipedia. And should
the page become deleted at some point, we still have the version of
record from the journal.

Cheers,

Daniel

This is fantastic!

Does anyone have a photo or scan of the physical newspaper?

As well as the Guardian today, there was also a 6 minute slot on BBC Radio 4
http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b01ddxcs  ~24 mins in, discussing Open
Access.


The issue is clearly going mainstream.
This program also asked for listener feedback on this issue:
"if you have a view on this... please email us at pm at bbc.co.uk"

may I suggest we send them our opinions on the benefits of Open Access, and
the injustices of toll-access?

Peter, when you mention it, you could perhaps add that a bit of
funding is available for other journals to do something similar - see
last paragraph in my blog post.

Thanks,

Hi Egon,

I do not see journals lining up yet, but as just mentioned in the mail
to Peter, I do have some funds to make experimenting a bit sweeter for
other journals too:

Hi All,

Events are certainly piling up.
While this is happening we should in my opinion not loose sight of the
danger that everybody now starts talking about open access as if it were
one clearly defined item.
I will write a blog today on @ccess site to stress this point.
WRT your suggestion Ross could we send a reaction as @ccess Initiative to
bbc.
This could help to put @ccess on the map and hopefully draw attention to
our ideas on what access is and on the problems that especially   scholarly
poor have
What do you think?

TOM

Hi All

Great news! I saw the Wellcome article online yesterday but didn't realise
it would get on the front page.
I could assist with a response this evening or tomorrow.

A FWD from the GOAL mailing list:
Alma Swan just pointed out that it was actually on BBC Radio 4 TWICE
yesterday!
I missed out on the much earlier coverage on the morning news program
'Today' it's about 5 minutes long and features just Mark Walport

Tom: I'm sure we can produce both individual and @ccess responses for the
BBC, hopefully it'll encourage them to cover this issue more.

The BBC picked up the Guardian?s article of Monday (
http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/apr/09/frustrated-blogpost-boycott-scientific-journals)
and covered the topic in two interviews yesterday on main news shows.

1. The Wellcome Trust's Mark Walport was interviewed about Open Access on

the BBC's flagship radio news programme, Today, yesterday morning. The
interview is 72 minutes into the programme:
*http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b01dcmbf
*

2. Prof Stephen Duffy and Graham Taylor (Publishers Association) debated

Open Access on the BBC's early evening radio news programme yesterday. The
interview is 24 minutes into the programme:
*http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b01ddxcs*

Yes. This is the first battle in the war. It is not the last.

PS

to continue the theme of Open Science / new Wellcome trust OA policy in the
news...
I wasn't previously aware of this article on the BBC News website, no less:

'Trust pushes for open access to research' published Tuesday April 10th
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17668722

may I suggest we tweet, blog, facebook etc this link to try and get it on
the Top 10 most read/shared articles on BBC? It's not even on the News
front page atm :(
One has to navigate to
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science_and_environment/ before
one can see it so it's rather hidden away atm

Hi All

The deadline for stream proposals is approaching so please add your ideas
to the Etherpad in as much detail as you can over the next couple of
days! The festival co-ord team are particularly keen for sessions to take
place in various formats, not just the traditional talk or panel, so get
creative!
http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

The final edits will take place on Thursday night and Friday morning before
the proposal is submitted.

Thanks Jessy!
Laura and I are chatting to Kat and Jussi from the OKFest team tomorrow to
confirm what we need to do and then we'll tidy up/formalise the pad and
transfer it to the OKFest form on Friday so no need to write up formally.

Keep the great ideas coming everyone!

Hi all,

Jenny, Tom Olijhoek and I will be chatting to the OKFest team in about half
an hour (4:30pm BST). If you would like to be more involved in the planning
at this stage, please do drop me and line and you'd be very welcome to join
the call!

Otherwise the three of us will work on tidying the ideas in the etherpad
into proposal format this evening. We can continue to plan further once we
(hopefully!) have approval from the main OKFest team :)

Cheers,
Laura

I'm afraid I don't have time for this call today -- please omit me.

There's not much I would have contributed this time, anyway:

> Did anyone write a reaction for BBC4 radio?

I didn't -- I've actually not heard the pieces, and I wonder whether
that iron has gone cold now?

> Alok's talk with Mike this week about the Who Needs Access? angle.

He hasn't got back to me.  I will prod him.  I did get this piece in
to the Guardian, though:

Hi all, I cannot make the call today either, but here is an update:

Malaria indices:

* still waiting for data from Malaria World
* still waiting for access renewal from Medline
* OKF server has been fixed, so I will get the data from the older Medline
snapshot this weekend
* I have run the wikipedia PMC parser provided by Daniel Mietchen now that
it has been fixed and have retrieved the data
* the wikipedia parser still errors when filtering for creativecommons
though, so will work on that this weekend too


If all goes will with the OKF server this weekend, I should have the
service up and running with what data we have by Monday. Then, I will just
be waiting for the data from Malaria World and the update from Medline, and
can add those records once they are available. Then we will be able to do
an analysis and write up what we find.

Mark

Hi,

As I mentioned in the Skype meeting today,  I made a tentative spreadsheet
based on data for malaria papers from Google Scholar metrics

Here is the link

Hi everyone,

The OKFest etherpad is coming into shape! See:
http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

I think we have an (almost) final version now. Please do feel free to read
through and make any further edits in the next few hours. I will take a
final look later this afternoon and then submit around 5pm BST.

Thanks for all your help!
Laura

>>>>>
>>>>> This pioneering event will include an action-packed week of lectures,

>>>>>
>>>>> The exploration of this theme will not only be visible in the

>>>>> First Round Deadline: April 20th 2012
>>>>> Second Round Deadline: June 1st 2012
>>>>>
>>>>> We are looking for proposals related to specific open knowledge and
>>>>> open data topics, but also new viewpoints and cross-cutting issues which

Hello, I have just added certainty next to my name for attending and
speaking re the Open Access Index, and have suggested myself under the
communicating science as well - I can speak about the BibServer and the
Total Impact software if there is interest. Looks like a lot of interesting
stuff!

Yes - one things that we are starting to need is a handbook / toolkit for
this.  An overview of the tools that you and others have developed.

I have just submitted our proposal for an Open Science Stream - fingers
crossed we will get allocated plenty of time and space at OKFest :)

Thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas so far. Once we hear back from
the organisers about how many slots they can allocate us, I'm sure there'll
be opportunities to refine our plans further.

Thanks all, enjoy your weekends!
Laura

See below for a message from the OKFest committee.

If anyone feels strongly that they do *not* want science stream info to be
published, please drop me an email asap. I'm assuming we have no concerns.

As a reminder, the etherpad with details of what we submitted is here:

To: "info at okfestival.org" <info at okfestival.org>



Hello,

This email is sent everyone who submitted a proposal on the first round of
Open Knowledge Festival Call for Proposals. Thank you very much for your
contribution!

In total we received 22 Topic Stream proposals and 49 Individual
Presentation proposals. In addition we registered approximately 15 ideas
that came from the brainstorming session in Helsinki on 10 April (
http://okfestival.okfnpad.**org/helsinki-meeting-10-april<http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/helsinki-meeting-10-april>
)**.

ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION - ANSWER LATEST ON THURSDAY 26 APRIL:

We would like to publish basic information about the proposals we received.
Please let us know if it is ok to publish:

A) Title, Keywords, Content + Format, Contact person name, People / Team
members
or
B) Please do not publish any information

If we don't hear from you we assume that the answer is *A*.

The OKFestival planning group will go through all the proposals during next
2 days (24 & 25 April) and will then submit a proposal of OKFestival
programme structure for the Advisory Board to comment. The decisions will
be published on 2nd of May.

Best regards,

Juha Huuskonen.

OKFestival coordinator / Helsinki

Message-ID: <CACGRf4KOYg2DuLUDmZbrY54mzWdxUjoJZXJB1C1GXsv14rAGGw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I have been keeping an eye on the blogs by Peter Murray-Rust about
text-mining and, following his most recent
update<http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/04/25/text-mining-the-scholarly-literature-towards-a-set-of-universal-principles-update-and-strategy/>,
I will forward all communications between PMR and the Publishers to this
List.

This is in accordance with the original statements of openness
here<http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/03/02/our-protocol-for-text-mining-preamble-and-%E2%80%9Cinstitutionalism%E2%80%9D-elsevier-and-other-publishers-should-take-note/>which
ensure all correspondence is publicly available.

(Apologies if some of these duplicate e-mails already CCd to the List).

Regards,
Naomi Lillie

Philip,
We are making a submission in response to the Hargreaves report and
specifically about the freedom to extract and publish factual information
from scientific publications. I have appreciated your cooperation in the
past over the requirement to publish data that supports scientific
research. I have copied Timo who, as you know, has supported our research
here in developing semantic informatics, including tools for extraction.
This involved a summer student and in-kind support for our Sciborg (EPSRC)
project. You'll know that two of our staff have since joined Timo's Digital
Science; and we are very proud to produce valuable human resources.

We are now in the position where we can extract factual chemical
information from the full text of articles with high precision and recall
(OPSIN accuracy is > 99.5% and recall > 95%) and with great speed and
cost-effectiveness. The University of Cambridge is a subscriber to NPG
journals and we would like to begin to extract information on a systematic
basis for Open scientific research. We don?t need technical help or
permission from NPG. We have copied Cambridge University Library staff.

This mail is to ask your assurance that we can do this without (a)
legal/contractual barriers from NPG and (b) that we shall not be cut off by
NPG robots (unfortunately this happened some years ago). We wish to start
immediately to show Hargreaves the benefit of information mining ? they
have a deadline for 2012-03-21 so we would like your agreement by
2012-03-15. All we require is:

*YES: you may mine and publish factual information from the full text of
NPG journals without additional payment and without restriction from legal
and technical barriers.*

I hope you can trust me to act responsibly on not violating copyright and
being considerate to your robots. I have set out more details and a
non-exhaustive illustration of facts in
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/03/04/information-mining-and-hargreaves-i-set-out-the-absolute-rights-for-readers-non-negotiable.

Unfortunately any other reply than YES by 2012-03-15 will be regarded as
unacceptable for the purposes of Hargreaves.

You will note that we are also approaching other major publishers of
chemistry. Elsevier has already publicly said we can mine their content for
research and we?ll be publishing the facts under an Open licence.

Best wishes,

Peter

Peter,

As you are aware, NPG's text mining policy was stated in a recent Nature
editorial.

We allow site licence customers to mine licensed text (for non commercial
purposes) subject to contract. The terms are simple, in line with your own
suggestions:

1. We require a guarantee that you will not violate our copyrights (but of
course we provide permission to reproduce snippets of text).

2. We require a guarantee you will use a low impact crawler (we also need
to know the IP address of your crawler, so we don't inadvertently block it).

3. We require a guarantee you will store the mined text securely, and only
for the purposes of the stated experiment.

If you can provide these guarantees, we are very happy to allow you (and
our other site licence customers) to crawl, mine and publish factual
information from our full text, without payment or further restrictions.

Best regards,

David Hoole

Dear Bob Campbell,
We were at the meeting last week in Oxford on the "Evolution of
Scholarship" where you stated that anyone could mine content in Wiley
journals for factual information, and re-use and republish it. Cambridge
subscribes to many Wiley journals and I and many other scientists wish to
mine factual information using machines.

We cannot do this at present as Wiley imposes two barriers:

   -  legal restrictions of text-mining through contracts (Wiley has in the
   past threatened scientists with legal action for extracting facts)
   - Wiley's server-side robots which will shut off the University if we
   attempt to download publications automatically.

*I would therefore like you (immediately, as we wish to start immediately)
to confirm that Wiley will absolutely and for ever allow subscribers, at no
additional cost, to mine all content for facts in both back issues and
current publications as soon as they appear.*

Answeriing "YES" to this question is all that is required. Any other
answer, including the request for discussion will be taken as "NO". Please
reply by the end of today (2012-03-07).

I have published a background document (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/03/04/information-mining-and-hargreaves-i-set-out-the-absolute-rights-for-readers-non-negotiable/)
which also gives a wide range of illustrations of factual information.
In
places it reads "Elsevier", please substitute "Wiley".

Please note that we do not need any help from Wiley in systematically
downloading papers. We shall use a delay of 1 second between downloads and
we shall not re-publish verbatim the papers we download.

Thank you and I look forward to your immediately reply and agreement.

Excellent. You'll appreciate that this is a matter of great public interest
at present and an opportunity to show how helpful publishers are, so I'll
be posting the correspondence on my blog.

I don't have specific requirements. I have the technology to extract facts
from Wiley publications and do scientific research on them and I'd like to
do that. In the first instance I'll analyze which journals contain
chemistry and extract all the chemical facts and then do research on them.
Since the data are factual there is no question of copyright being violated.
As our group is the leading creator of Open Source information-mining
software for chemistry and we are regarded as among the world's experts I
have a large number of collaborators. There are a large number of projects
already but we add at least one a week so there's no point in burdening you
with the details. Here are just 5 to show you the power.

   - scanning the literature for potential antimalarial compounds (Mat
   Todd). We have to search for every compound as there is no golden rule for
   finding drugs against this killer disease
   - finding second harmonic generators for solar panels, leading to
   increased energy efficiency and greenness for the planet
   - Computing the human metabolome. Again we have to find all instances
   where compounds have been mentioned that might be human metabolites
   - Improving the eco-friendliness of chemical reactions. What solvents
   have been used in what reactions? Can we use solvents that are more
   friendly to the planet. Again we need to look at every reaction.
   - Improving the accuracy of computaional chemistry. There are billions
   of dollars spent on trying to predict the structure of matter. We want to
   find every paper and find the most cost effective methods

 There are also many added benefits in scientific information-mining
research itself where I am an acknowledged world expert (sorry to sound
boastful, it's just to assure you I know what I'm doing).

I'm not asking you to get involved in any of the technical details and we
don't need any special technology from the publisher, any special versions
of the articles or any APIs. There is no need to involve CUL in details.
All we need is:


   1. To download and analyze, using machines, papers from Wiley journals
   to which we have subscriptions (we use web-friendly crawling protocols)
   2. An assurance from Wiley that you will not impose technical and
   legal/contractual barriers.
   3. To be able to publish the data on which the science is based (science
   without data is almost worthless as you know)

We give you an assurance that we shan't deliberately publish any copyright
material such as the complete verbatim Version of Record.

There is an urgency. We are keen to start some of these projects within a
day or two as we want to present to the Hargreaves enquiry how valuable
text-mining can be. We therefore only need from you an assurance that we
can employ factual mining and to get into the report we'll need this by
2012-03-14. I am afraid promises of intent are worthless at this stage.
There is only one acceptable answer:

YES - you can go ahead without further permission from Wiley

anything else, I'm afraid will be a NO for Hargreaves.

I am pulling all this together at the weekend, I hope.

One immediate observation is that it is a lot of work to manage several
publishers all with different APIs. We've had to do this with
crystallography and write a different subcrawler for each journal. If all
publishers exposed through - say - ATOM (or OAI-PMH) it would be a lot
easier technically

This is a relative clear answer. It puts the onus on the librarians rather
than RSC (who drafted the licence) and it prevents useful scale. Every
research in every institution has to find the right librarian to ask and
hope there is a consistency. In fact librarians almost always err against
offending copyright so will say no.

That's fair.

This is the problem. There is no fair use in this jurisdiction - it is by

Agreed. Again some public information on this would be useful.

Hi Mike

But the communication says

"Unfortunately any other reply than YES by 2012-03-15 will be regarded as
unacceptable for the purposes of Hargreaves."

Which is all about a specific stance, isn't it? The only data is whether we
agree with a request to mine, yes or no, and is put in the context of
showing Hargreaves the benefits of mining. So as an information gathering
exercise on policy I'm not sure it'll work.

In other news, there was a CCC meeting on Data and Text Mining in Amsterdam
last week, and a draft cross-publisher mining license has been prepared for
discussion with the pharma people; there's also a working group on a common
text mining format.

Best wishes

Richard

Hi Peter,****

I have just posted the following message to your blog which I hope will
pass the moderation process and be shared publicly.  With kind wishes,****

*Hi Peter,*

* *

*As I indicated to you when we met in Oxford, we (at Elsevier) have no
problem in principle with you text mining for research purposes. There are
some practical matters to resolve through discussion.  With regret I have
formed the view that you are not - at this time ? really seeking practical
solutions.  If this changes please do let me know as we remain willing to
work with you and other colleagues at Cambridge - and elsewhere - who need
and want to text mine.  *

* *

*While I am here, I would like to stress the real value of librarians in
these discussions.  Your library colleagues at Cambridge have ? both
directly and through JISC Collections ? relationships and existing
agreements with a wide array of publishers.  They are constructive partners
for us all in facilitating text mining and scaling up as we move forward.*

* *

*Subject:* Re: Text Mining at Cambridge University****

** **

Thank you for your mail,

I have started the discussion openly on my blog. I believe that my wishes
map onto the requirements of the whole world which I and my colleagues will
be setting out over the next 24 hours or so.

I would like all discussions to be made open from now on - there is nothing
special about Peter Murray-Rust and the University of Cambridge. I will
outline my particular project on the blog.

I am, in principle, prepared to have a teleconference though I don't see
the point. I am asking for my rights - which I discussed with you - to
extract factual information from content in Elsevier journals and to
republish this without constraint.

The only problems to be addressed are the removal of the contractual
constraints that currently forbid anyone in any university doing this and
the Elsevier robot which will detect my activity and probably brand my
activities as illegitimate and cut off the university.

I am happy to have the teleconference on the basis that what I agree
applies equally to all subscribers to Elsevier content.

Looking forward to talking.

I am not free this afternoon but can make time after 2200 this evening
until 2400. I don't kow how that fits with your schedules

P.

Dear Anne, Patricia, and Peter****

 ****

We are keen to arrange a teleconference with you all to discuss ways to
enable text mining for academics at Cambridge University.  I met Peter for
the first time on Wednesday, and he clearly feels very frustrated with
Elsevier as he has sought in various ways to obtain text mining services
for the last couple of years.  We clearly need to focus on his specific
project, but I am hopeful that in parallel we can explore whether there is
a broader text mining requirement at Cambridge (I strongly suspect there
is) and the best way to empower the library to support this.  By working
together we are most likely to find solutions that will scale.****

My colleague, Jason Roof, has kindly agreed to set up this teleconference
for us.  ****

Comment:
Hi Peter,

Elsevier, like many other publishers, has technical measures in place on
our websites to limit crawling and these would prevent you from taking the
technical approach you have outlined. We have these measures in place
because web crawling, while ubiquitous, is generally not the most efficient
method of harvesting large quantities of content from sites such as ours
(you are experienced in this area, but other interested readers might refer
for example to Nelson et al., Efficient, Automatic Web Resource Harvesting,
http://public.lanl.gov/herbertv/papers/f140-nelson.pdf).  We are keen to
provide the right data to you in the right format in a way that doesn?t
impair the experience of our other users and that is scalable.
Recognising that you, and other users, need programmatic access to the
content, we have invested in recent years in services specifically designed
to support machine-to-machine access, including a comprehensive suite of
APIs and a content syndication service. We would be more than happy to work
with you to explain how these services work and how we believe they can
support your needs.  We have existing agreements that cover the use of
these services.  If these are not right for you, then we are happy to work
with you to develop an agreement tailored for your project.

With kind wishes,

Alicia

I appreciate that it's short notice. I am not deliberately trying to put
you under pressure. I was hoping the answer would be simple. That Springer
would be able to say "YES, everyone can textmine facts".  If it's not
simple, then that's the situation that I have to report.

FWIW I have been trying to get clear terms out of assorted publishers for
several years and failing with many. I couldn't get a clear answer out of
Springer 4 years ago on their Open Access licences in hybrid journals. It's
not a new issue.

By contrast with BMC I can answer the question in 15 seconds - inspect the
licence and that's it.

So no, I am not trying to be confrontational but all major publisher,
whether deliberately or not, make it almost impossible to get clear
information. Unless Jan Velterop had given me your name I wouldn't have
know where to go in Springer

Best

Peter

Peter,

I hope and expect this is a good base to continue working on this. I'd like
to stress that we always have been committed to be flexible and
constructive when talking about mining for non-commerci purposes.

Btw, has the issue with the license of springer open access articles you
mentioned ever been solved?

This seems very constructive. I note that some agreements have been for a 5

That is a good idea. There is also the possibility of some form of caching.

Obviously for open access content the nc does not apply, for licensed
content we charge commercials (like chemical abstracts).****

Yes, you can mine the oa artils. It has An attribute in the metadata saying
open access or sth like that.****

** **

The springer open articles are on the biomed central platform so you can
mine them he way you are used with bmc.****

You solved most of it earlier this year when you moved to CC-BY for

I do have a problem with labelling. It can be difficult to find which
articles are OA. And I assume we can mine  the hybrid Gold OA without
explciti permission. In contrast Wiley make their articles almost unusable.*

I do have a problem with labelling. It can be difficult to find which
articles are OA. And I assume we can mine  the hybrid Gold OA without
explciti permission. In contrast Wiley make their articles almost unusable.*

 Dear dr. Rust,

Thank you for your message to our offices.



To reply to your question, this is needed because systematic downloading is
a copyright description and is independent from the publisher?s decision.

However, Springer is very open minded on crawling for research purposes.

One has to keep in mind though that mining may have negative impact on the
structure of the website and will disturb user statics.

 Prof. Murray-Rust ? I am responding to your email of March 10 to Madeleine
Jacobs. First, let me congratulate you and Dr. Rzepa on winning the Herman
Skolnik Award. You are joining a group of distinguished awardees and we
hope that you are able to enjoy the recognition you will receive in San
Diego.****

** **

Regarding your request, the American Chemical Society does not grant to
you, as an individual investigator, permission to perform large-scale text
and data mining across the entire corpus of our publications. We would,
however, welcome the opportunity to clarify with the Cambridge University
library representatives who are responsible for providing you with licensed
access to ACS Publications what additional terms and conditions they would
be interested in pursuing in order to enable you to pursue your
university-based research and create works of your own from our
publications.  ****

** **

As you no doubt appreciate, we will want to clarify with your
administrators at Cambridge University questions around access, data
processing and the intended distribution of the outputs of the data and
text mining that you propose. Your library colleagues at Cambridge have
relationships and existing agreements not only with ACS, but with a wide
array of publishers. We would be pleased to engage directly with your
library colleagues, and encourage you to refer this letter onward, and to
communicate our request that they serve as a point of contact to facilitate
a discussion about your requirements.****

Message-ID: <CAD2k14MMbX4GJwQorLT88-=LFWkgmD7YdYOJ8jFe9tmsXWtf0w@mail.gmail.com>

Stevan Harnad has just published a set of criteria for Open Access in which
he argues that the prime purpose of research is for funded resarches. He
writes http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/2012/04.html

7. Most research is technical, intended to be used and applied by peer
researchers in building further research and applications -- to the
benefit of the general public.

8. But most peer-reviewed research reports themselves are neither
understandable nor of direct interest to the general public as reading
matter.

9. Hence, for most research, "public access to publicly funded
research," is not reason enough for providing OA, nor for mandating
that OA be provided.

I find this totally unacceptable and have written to the list. This
attititude is at the root of many of our problems.

Now, if you run the statistics, 7 and 8 can
probably be verified, but how 9 follows from that
I can't understand. Any patient group, for
instance, is a minority and therefore aren't
enough reason to receive access to the research
concerning their illness?
That makes absolutely no sense at all. Moreover,
compared with the sum of all and every such
interest groups (of which each is likely a
minority), the number of researchers likely pales.
So if anything, 'peer access' is the politically
much weaker argument.

These may be facts, but that does not justify them per se. Most senior
chemists are white males.

On 8. the lack of access is self-fulfilling. As a result of working with
Ross Mounce I am now looking at phylogenetic trees. I am certain that
anyone with an interest in biology/environment - e.g. naturalists,
planners, high-school students, etc. - would be capable of understanding
these.

Maybe we should start posting Open papers as examples that "anyone" can
understand. I think phylogenetics would be a good place to start as I am
sure there are huge numbers of people that can understand and many would be
interested.

It's the same bullsh*** we read of Harnad often. I think it is
remarkable that in this science-centered list "open access" the
humanities are widely ignored. It's clear that in the humanities #7-9
are false.

Klaus,
There is no intention that this list is "scientist-only". It may be that
most of the contributors are scientists but that's not intended. The
argument is sometimes made (like Harnad does) that STM is too difficult for
anyone outside universities - I have to challenge this.

I would have thought it was even easier to make the cases that papers in
A+H had wide potential appeal.

I have also put in a comment on the blog.
I am thinking of writing a blog on the @ccess site next week to give our
view on the reasons for open access for all

Great. Although SH does not command universal support his views have
considerable influence on policy and in cases like this should be challenged
