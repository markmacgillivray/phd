Hi All,

the last planned Skype meeting we ran into difficulties as I met with Mark
Mc Gillivray and we could't use Skype in the Public Library of Amsterdam.
I have now planned this meeting for tomorrow with a slightly updated agenda.
the meeting pad is here http://open-access.okfnpad.org/20

Hope to talk to many of you tomorrow

Well apparently no one is available on Skype, although I only saw a
last-minute message from Mark that he could not attend.
Anyway the meeting is off. Let me know when any of you wants a new meeting.
I can switch to Friday afternoon as Mark has requested this

I had a meeting. It;s possible I could manage late Friday

I have a great idea for Open datasets which is based on Open biblio and
CKAN / Datahub and will explain this

Hi Peter,

I would love to hear your idea, others too I guess.
Is tomorrow 3.30 pm or 4.00 pm BST a good time?

I am sure I can manage 1600

Basically the idea is to extract open data sets and put the DATA in
browsable form in the OKFs Datahub which I hadn't realised was so well
advanced.

If you can find me a useful malaria paper with some useful CSV tables I
will put them in the data hub.

Dear all,

I've often seen it said that there's no evidence that allowing Green
OA has a negative effect on journal revenues. Is there any evidence
that it does NOT have a negative effect, or is it just that no-one's
done a good study that shows there IS a negative effect?

Does anyone have references, either way?

Subject: [Open-access] Use of Datahub for open data sets
Message-ID: <CAD2k14MTDi2ue3KGWyv+BHPV2+S306ikZ4DJEC9UV+1MViT5bQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have spent time with the OKF CKAN/Datahub group this week and have become
aware of the potential of Datahub for managing and displaying datasets. As
an example I took a BMC article with 4 supplementary CSV files and created:
http://datahub.io/dataset/finding-biological-process-modifications-in-cancer-tissues-by-mining-gene-expression-correlations
(This is simply the original article captions and the tables - I haven't
added anything).

The Datahub is a well-advanced tool and I think has potential for
associating datasets with bibserver collections. It allows online display
of the data and can be used for aggregation and modelling. It's been used
in this way for government data where it is highly regarded. This is not
trivial for science as very few datasets have good enough metadata, but
good linkers are things like GO terms, PDB Ids, etc.

An achievable vision would be to crawl the open literature and extract all
CSV files into datahub.

I will talk about this this afternoon.
If Tom or anyone has a paper with a nice set of CSV files I will put them
into datahub. I'm also happy to show this off at tomorrow's hackathon.

P.

Hi all,

I have recently updated the Research and Education topic stream page for
OKFest: http://okfestival.org/topic-stream-open-research-and-education/

As speakers confirm and we begin to finalise the sessions, the programme is
looking more and more exciting - we hope to gather even more details in the
coming weeks. Things are also moving forward fast logistically, so I
strongly recommend you to start exploring flights and accommodation at this
stage. Logistically, most Science events will be taking place on Wednesday
19th September, with some sessions spilling over onto Thursday 20th. There
will also be a satellite Hackday to kick-start events on Tuesday 18th
September.

The more people we can get together to talk about Open Science and Open
Access, the more valuable OKFest will be - so do try to join us if you can!

Looking forward to seeing you there!

All the best,
Laura

Thank you Iryna for the introduction

Dear Donalla, Nalalia, Jochen,

What I would like to ask you and the OpenAire group of the EU, is if you
see possibilities for cooperation with us on developing an open access
index for scientific fields.
The index will be a figure for the amount of open access in a field
for malaria we find for example 30.7 % open access using the BOAI
definition for open access.
Furthermore we have an indexed list of journals publishing open access
malaria papers, which can be an incentive for scientists to publish and for
publishers to go (more) open access and for policy makers to monitor open
access in scientific publishing.
We will publish our Malaria Open Access Index later this year, and would
like to develop the concept further in cooperation with other parties and
with adequate funding
Please let us know your position in this

regards

Tom Olijhoek
coordinator @ccess initiative at OKFN

Dear All,

Big news today that the brilliant Linked Open Vocabularies
project<http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/index.html>has now officially
migrated to Open Knowledge Foundation servers. We are
very pleased to welcome this fantastic project to the family.

For those who don't know the the Linked Open Vocabularies Project can be
summed up in 5 simple points:

   - LOV is about vocabularies (aka. metadata element sets or ontologies)
   in OWL / RDFS used to describe linked data.
   - LOV provides a single-stop access to the Vocabulary Commons ecosystem
   - LOV helps to improve vocabularies understanding, visibility,
   usability, synergy, sustainability and overall quality
   - LOV promotes a technically and socially sustainable management of the
   Vocabulary Commons ecosystem
   - LOV is a community and open project. You are welcome to join the team
   of gardeners of the Vocabulary Commons!

Read more about it in Pierre-Yves Vandenbussche's post for the Open
Knowledge Foundation
blog<http://blog.okfn.org/2012/07/10/announcing-linked-open-vocabularies-lov-enabling-the-vocabulary-commons/>.
Please do circulate this news to your friends and networks.

All the best,
Sam

Dear Colleague,

BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine is pleased to be able to
add scientific rigour to the debate about open access research, by
publishing an article which compares the scientific impact of open access
with traditional subscription publishing and has found that both of these
publishing business models produce high quality peer reviewed articles.

Open for business: open access journals reaching the same scientific impact
as subscription journals

BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine is pleased to be able to
add scientific rigour to the debate about open access research, by
publishing an article which compares the scientific impact of open access
with traditional subscription publishing and has found that both of these
publishing business models produce high quality peer reviewed articles.

The debate about who should pay for scientific publishing is of continuing
importance to the scientific community but also to the general public who
not only often pay for the research though charitable contributions, their
taxes, and by buying products, but are also affected by the results
contained within these articles.

Many publically funded agencies, such as the Wellcome Trust and NIH require
that scientific research sponsored by them is made freely available to the
public. However the issues aren't as simple as just putting the results of
your research on line. Scientific research goes through the quality control
filter of peer review and journals act as gatekeepers performing
quality-assuring peer review, and who provide web-based repositories.
Scientists currently rely on publishing in peer reviewed high quality
journals to show that their research itself is of good quality, is of
importance to their field of research, and consequently improves their
chances of obtaining funding to continue their work.

One way of measuring quality is by impact factors calculated from citation
data (how many times other scientists have mentioned the research).
Bo-Christer Bjork from Hanken School of Economics, Helsinki, and David
Solomon from Michigan State University compared the impact factors of 610
open access journals and over 7000 subscription journals.

The citation rate for subscription journals was overall 30% higher than for
open access ones but this difference was largely due to a high share of
older OA journals, particularly from regions like Latin America in the
citation indexes. When like was compared with like, for instance, journals
founded after 2000 from difference regions or disciplines, the differences
disappeared.

Bo-Christer Bjork, explained, "The open access debate has included
accusations from some traditional publishers and their lobbyists that Open
Access publishing implies low scientific quality and endangers the quality
assurance function of the peer review system that the academic community
and publishers have built up over decades."

Explaining the results Prof Bjork said, "If you take into account the
journal discipline, location of publisher and age of publication the
differences in impact between open access and subscription journals largely
disappear. In medicine and health, open access journals founded in the last
10 years are receiving on average as many citations as subscription
journals launched during the same time."

David Solomon continued, "It is easy to see why scientists might be
sceptical of electronic, open access journals - after all they have their
reputation to maintain. Open access journals that fund publishing with
article processing charges (APCs), sometimes called gold open access, are
on average cited more than other OA journals. Since the launch of
professionally run high quality biomedical journals in 2000 gold OA has
increased by 30% per year and many of these are on a par with their
subscription counterparts."

Subject: [Open-access] fairy tale and more
Message-ID: <CAGyWN8YR8Eq4GyUSCzUxzOaRX9T9-9JhPX=JA1XxUrxVKAGo6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

On the Skype call today we had a very interesting discussion on how to get
to open access in practice.
There is the political lobby that is necessary (Cameron told some hows and
why's) and also  the bottom up kind of revolution needed in the scientific
community, where I have painted a strategy that I also put as a comment to
PMR fairy tale story
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/07/12/reforming-scholpub-a-fairy-tale/
I also happened to see a contribution yesterday in the OKF ideas incubator
that I think is of interest
http://ideas.okfn.org/ideas/422/a-web-community-of-academics-with-the-aim-of-killing-the-current-journal-publishing-model
Let's discuss how we can advance and get open access as the publishing
standard for science in our lifetime. Peter suggested (jokingly) a sort of
pirate party for open access to science. I think we can organize
communities of scientists and non-scientists for different fields, start
with a small number of these and let this grow organically.
All ideas on how to proceed, please share!

Hi Peter and other list members,

I just happened to find very interesting info on quality of medical
journals, new forms for peer review, patient-doctor interactions to improve
science and treatments, journal of participatory medicine to aid the
former, Ovations initiative for combating chronic diseases in developed and
developing world.
All this because I read an article on scientific quality mentioning Richard
Smith and started looking:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smith_(editor)

I am amazed that I haven't come across this before,since he is one of the
early proponents of open access publishing. But some of you may know him
and his work?
Definitely worth following up in my opinion

I'd not heard of Richard Smith either until a week ago when he wrote
this blog at the BMJ:
http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2012/06/28/richard-smith-a-bad-bad-week-for-access/
and then this one:

Some excellent, hard-hitting stuff.

I had heard of him but don't come across him regularly so it had faded. I
think he has been brave and is some years ahead of his time and it's clear
that he needs promoting. Maybe  a Panton Discussion .

Hmmm. What about nominating him for a knighthood...? Been around enough and contributed enough to deserve one IMO.

This is a nice paper from some people in the Google Policy unit. The last section draws together a lot of the evidence around the economic advantages of Open Access and Open Data.

Hi Cameron,

Great paper. Thanks for the link!
It is a free download but what about the terms of use on the link page for
this paper ? Are we only allowed to read this?? "you are not allowed to use
any of the content of an epaper except the abstract  for non-commercial or
commercial purposes" as I read it.

Hi all,

The EU press release<http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/790&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en>concerning
the open access to data and publications notes

The European Commission will continue to fund projects related to open
access. In 2012-2013, the Commission will spend ?45 million on data
infrastructures andresearch on digital preservation. Funding will continue
under the Horizon 2020 programme. During the same period, the Commission
will support experimentation with new ways of handling scientific
information (e.g. new peer-review methods and ways of measuring article
impact).

I would think that our efforts with OA index and scientific communities
with topical databases are also eligible for funding as "new ways of
handling scientific information"
What do you think?

Certainly. We need partners - and of course European funded is competitive.
But I would think that something based on Datahub + malaria could look
attractive.

I think many repositories ritually add CC-NC because they think it's the
right thing to do. Some will react positively when it is pointed out that
it isn't.

This is spot on. I think a lot of us have so fully absorbed the BOAI
that we've forgotten what a tremendously seductive idea an NC clause
is to people coming to open access for the first time. Sorting that
out is going to be one activities of the next five years. (In Britain,
UKRC's new policy is going to be a big help.)

There are at least two - and possibly more areas where we should challenge
NC:
* publishers who offer "gold" or "full-OA", sometimes through
incompetence/ignorance (e.g. copying what other  publishers do)
* repositories who do this because it's the "natural thing" for academics
to do (and for some of them they haven't any horizons beyond the ivory tower
* non-profits who traditionally collect or are given info and this is a
hold on their established powerbase

I think it could be very useful to have a one-page doc to send to these
people explaing why NC is not appropriate or effective. Otherwise we all
write something different and look uncoordinated

It's more than one page, but
http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001210
is a good place to start. The printed version is three pages.

In case this could be something we get involved in. Needs a UK academic as
partner (I don't count)


Please find below BBSRC funding opportunities.



   - *BBSRC: Tools and Resources Development Fund: Call 1*

The Tools and Resources Development Fund aims to pump prime the next
generation of tools, technologies and resources that will be required by
bioscience researchers. The call will consider proposals for:****

   - Early concept, exploratory investigations of new tools, technologies
   and resources.****
   - Rapid access to, and novel deployment of, the very latest cutting edge
   technology (such proposals would normally include collaboration with the
   technology provider).****
   - Radical, novel modifications to existing tools, technologies and
   resources to facilitate new biological understanding and an expansion in
   use.****

** **

Applications should be for early concept development, particularly where
little pilot data exists. It is intended that funded research will involve
interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches and applications should
demonstrate appropriate collaborative connections, and biological
demonstration/knowledge derivation.****

Applicants interested in submitting projects related to the development of
bioinformatics, computational biology or algorithms, including data
sharing, should submit applications to the second call to be issued later
in 2012.****

*Funding*: The call will have an indicative budget of ?1.5M and successful
grants will not normally exceed ?120,000. Projects will last between 6 and
18 months.****

*Eligibility*: Normal BBSRC eligibility rules apply.****

*Deadline*: 4 September 2012 (16:00)****

For more information see:
http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/2012/2012-tools-resources-development-call1.aspx




   - *BBSRC: Sustainable Bioenergy and Biofuels*

** **
The BBSRC and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in India invite
collaborative (UK-India) research proposals that underpin the generation
and implementation of sustainable, advanced, bioenergy (including
biofuels). The call is focused around three priority areas:****
** **

   - Identification, characterisation and improvement of novel biomass
   (including algal biomass) processing enzymes.****
   - Application of systems and synthetic biology approaches for the
   development of microbial strains for the production of advanced biofuels
   and capable of using all of the sugars derived from lignocellulosic or
   algal biomass.****
   - The improvement of algal strains suitable for biofuel applications
   including genomics approaches.****

** **
Projects can address biological routes including bacteria, yeast, fungi,
micro- and macro-algae and terrestrial plant derived biomass. Applicants
considering projects outside the priority areas above should contact the
BBSRC at an early stage. All projects must employ second generation or
beyond technologies and should demonstrate that sustainability factors have
been taken into consideration.****
** **
The call will not fund theoretical projects that are not coupled with
experimental work, projects based on networking and knowledge transfer
only, the exploitation of thermochemical and/or other non-biological routes
to produce bioenergy; projects using first generation biofuel technologies;
or projects using feedstocks specific to the UK or India (unless used to
demonstrate a principle that can readily be translated to other feedstocks).
****
** **
*Eligibility*: Proposals must include applicants based in India and the UK
working together in cross-national teams on cross-disciplinary projects.
All UK applicants must adhere to BBSRC eligibility rules, while Indian
applicants must adhere to DBT rules. Non-eligible institutions may be
included in a project, but they will not receive funding.****
** **
*Funding*: BBSRC will fund the UK components and DBT the Indian components
of successful projects. Both bodies have earmarked up to ?5M for the call.
Projects should be up to a maximum duration of 3 years. There is no upper
cost limit per project, but it should be noted that multiple projects will
be funded. BBSRC funding will be awarded on the basic of full economic
costs and cannot be used to fund PhD students.****
** **
*Deadlines*:      Intention to submit form ? 30 August 2012 (16:00)****
Full proposals ? 9 October 2012 (16:00)****
** **

   - *Nitrogen: Improving on nature ? A joint BBSRC and NSF Ideas Lab*

** **
The BBSRC and the National Science Foundation (US) invite expressions of
interest to participate in an Ideas Lab Workshop to be held at Crewe Hall,
near Crewe (UK) from 3-7 December 2012.****
** **
The Lab will seek to develop innovative and transformative ways to reduce
inputs of nitrogen fertilizers to non-leguminous crops whilst maintaining
or increasing yield, through a multidisciplinary approach. This could be
achieved by:****
** **

   - Giving crops the ability to fix their own nitrogen****
   - Significantly increasing the nitrogen available to roots by
   manipulating the rhizosphere; or****
   - Significantly improving the crop?s nitrogen use efficiency.****

** **
Other approaches are also welcome, but the proposals generated by the Lab
are expected to have the potential to lead to a step-change in current
knowledge. A multi-disciplinary approach will be adopted and it is intended
that the Lab will lead to strong transatlantic alliances.****
** **
*Funding*: The Ideas Lab will develop outline proposals that will
subsequently be developed into full proposals and submitted for
consideration by the funding agencies. Up to $12M is available to fund
these proposals. Researchers who do not wish to participate in the Lab, but
would like to apply for BBSRC funding in this area can submit an
application at any time through responsive mode.****
** **
*Deadlines*: Applications must be received by 7 September 2012 (16:00)****
** **

It's worth noting that the problem here is that SSRN doesn't set a default licence, or encourage people directly to state one. This is a policy decision, they feel that it is the authors business. I have on at least one occasion argued with Gregg about this and they did say they would take a look at it, but if a bunch of people were to ask whether clear licenses could be provided that might convince them that it's an issue worth looking at.

??!

I can see why they might think it's the author's business to decide on
a licence -- but how can they possibly think that NOT SAYING is a good
option? That's crazy talk. And you can tell 'em I said so.

It's a cultural thing. Long standing tradition of these working papers in the areas that SSRN covers and no history of thinking about licensing. They're very big on making it as easy as possible to get stuff uploaded so putting as little burden as possible on authors...asking people to think about licenses when they never have before is an extra burden. I get the argument, I just think its worth them putting in a default setting and giving people the option to change it - even to no license if they want.

Hello all

I haven't posted before but have been following the discussions with much
interest and have founds the info and links provided by various people
really useful.  I run an open access cancer journal http://ecancer.org/ecms
which has no author fees - we are currently mainly supported by charity
funding but the journal has been growing at a great rate this year so I'm
looking into accessing any funding that might be out there to support open
access publishing.  The reality is that we will have to start charging
author fees at some point if we can't get more funding and we really don't
want to do that as providing a free service for the oncology community is
very important to us.

So does anyone know whether there is anything like SCOAP3 in the field of
medical publishing?

Thanks in advance for any help or advice anyone might be able to give me,

Katie Foxall

I don't think there is anything directly comparable - I would be happy to
post this on the GOAL open access list to gather ideas and to get some idea
of what the best estimate of break-even costs may be.

IMO SCOAP3 works because of the following factors:not

* the sense of community  - there is a reasonably clear distinction between
whether you are an HEP person or
* it's used to managing large funding and large projects.
* there is already a tradition of openness in physics (ArXiV).

I had the fortune to be invited to CERN by Salvatore Mele - a major
influence in SCOAP3 while they were building the ATLAS (which found the
Higgs). He said something like "Last week we lowered 500 M Eur or equipment
down that hole. A journal will cost 10 million (IIRC). We know how to run
large projects".

So I don't think the precise mechanism for cancer is there - but SCOAP3 has
proven the model can work and that makes new ideas much more tractable.

I have an idea which I might follow offline if you have ideas of the costs.

P.

SCOAP3 is unique as far as I know, in part because of the important factors that Peter points out. I did note yesterday that synthetic chemistry is an area where you could imagine this working. Its a defined literature and community. There is a lot of community cohesion and synthetic chemistry subscription budgets are often devolved to departments. <ironic>Of course this would require some imagination on the part of synthetic chemists</ironic>

Thank you Peter, that's a great help.

 

I'd certainly be interested in your idea - please let me know what details
you would need and I'll see what I can do.

There is not. Although SCOAP3's list of participants
(http://scoap3.org/whoisscoap3.html) is impressive this is a smaller
and much more homogeneous community than the field of biomedical
research. There are 5635 journals currently indexed by Medline, which
is itself not comprehensive; I think particle physics has only a few
dozen.

Nor should anyone try to build a SCOAP3 analogue for medicine. A
biomedical publishing monolith would be a target for intolerable
corporate corruption. A diverse publishing ecology is surely necessary
to avoid this. "Author pays" publishing is itself problematic: when I
first heard how much PLoS were going to charge authors for each
article, my first thought was "Blimey, that Harold Varmus must be on a
good salary!"*

So,

inspired by your table: http://ecancer.org/ecms/charges,
by George Monbiot: http://www.monbiot.com/2011/09/29/going-naked/,
by ArXiV: http://arxiv.org/help/support/whitepaper,
by the Journal of Machine Learning Research:
http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/pamphlet/2012/03/06/an-efficient-journal/,
and by Richard Smith
http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2012/07/03/richard-smith-medical-journals-a-gaggle-of-golden-geese/

I'd suggest you aim for radical transparency for your organ: from the
director's salary, to the editorial board's sandwich bill, to the last
paperclip and mousemat, get it online, with the objective of
convincing the reader that you're not merely payola-pushers for
whatever wondercure the drug companies have come up with this week.

Regards to all,

D.

*Just the faintest whiff of this remark is extractable from behind the
BMJ's paywall with the following search:
<http://www.bmj.com/search/advanced?author1=Carnall&text_abstract_title=Varmus&limit_from=1900-01-01&limit_to=2012-07-31&numresults=10&sort=relevance-rank&resultformat=standard&title_flags=all&abstract_title_flags=all&text_abstract_title_flags=all&searched=yes>
[Obviously you can't pay as many editors as the BMJ does, and expect a
"Blimey!" to make into the journal]
