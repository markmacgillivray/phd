Dear All

I am coordinating the @ccess group call this week and am planning to hold it tomorrow at 1330 British Time/1430 Western European time/1230 UTC. Unless anyone has an objection to that time we'll go ahead. I don't actually have access privileges to set up a new pad but if someone who does could then it should go at: http://open-access.okfnpad.org/25

Cheers

Cameron

I have talked a lot with Cameron and I think he can take forward some of
the ideas. They include:
* a formal technology to produce Open metadata for the scientific
literature (Pubcrawler/Bibserver)Small Business
Funding<http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/aclk?sa=l&ai=BSwgbNDoaUL6uN4OT0AWAjoDwAoWplKkD_d2h5jrAjbcBoMNxEAQYBCCGj4ACKAU4AFCvkq2f______8BYLu-nIPQCqABo7K45AOyAQ9tYWlsLmdvb2dsZS5jb226AQhnbWFpbC1jdsgBAdoBO2h0dHA6Ly9tYWlsLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vTVRRd09URTNORGN3TVRjMk1UQTVNemszTUVWWVVFRk9SRVZFgAIBqQIDWE4FzxK6PsgChYHNM6gDAcADHegDtwXoA64F9QMAAABE&num=4&sig=AOD64_0QokGGnGEjE2kjqigSKy4NswwqYg&adurl=http://www.businesscashadvance.co.uk/apply-now>
* technology to read the licence on a paper and see if it's BOAI-compliant.
(For me there are two sorts of Open Access: (a) BOAI-compliant (b)
NOT-Open-Access. It's true/false - there is no green/gold/gratis/libre
"fileNotFound". Our time is coming and people want this service. BOAI or
nothing.
* technology to see if a paper can be "read" from the splash page. This
will cover things like "Oh it was open access when we published it but that
was only for 6 months" (Elsevier did this to me - yes , I published with
them because there was a special OA issue - the experience was so awful
(200 emails) that I vowed never to do it again)
* the "Mounce plot". We talked yesterday. I'll let Ross describe it but
basically we need a score for NOT-open-access papers. This could get a lot
of attention. Basically BOIA/CC-BY/CC0/PD scores (say) 100. CC-NC scores
-20.  CC-ND another -20 no licence but waffle scores -60. Use of "fully
open" for non-BOAI scores -100. Closed access scores -500. These will be
arbitrary but we should agree on  them and publish them.

Hi all,

I have created a pad for you: http://open-access.okfnpad.org/25

I haven't added any agenda etc. as I feel a bit out of the loop here, but
you should be able to copy and paste from previous pads and adapt :)

Cheers,
Laura

publishing and wikimedia), making open access work in practice, and opening
up raw experimental data (led by Mark Hahnel from Figshare). There will
also be a host of workshops, hands-on sessions and drafting sprints, so do
come and join us!

On Tuesday 18th September, we will be holding a satellite hackday. Details

 Hi folks,

For a couple of years, I've kept the FOSsil Bank
wiki,<http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/>which is a collection of libre
resources (as well as proprietary resources
under what I call shareable
licences<http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/shareable-resources>).
For a couple of months, I've regularly posted updates about what new
entries have been added to the wiki. These updates go to the Living Libre
blog <http://livinglibre1.wordpress.com/> and the Free Culture discussion
list. <http://lists.freeculture.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss> They've been
well received.

Last week I sent around an update to the OKFN mailing list, and Joris Pekel
recommended this mailing list as the best place for future updates?let me
know if that's a problem!


Hi folks,

Another week and another update for the FOSsil Bank, a wiki of shareable
resources. As always, let me know if you have any suggestions.

Just a quick note:

Wiley have sent out a press release today to announce that they have
changed the licensing conditions of their 'WileyOpenAccess' branded
journals.
http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-104537.html

They have now adopted the Creative Commons Attribution
(CC-BY<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>)
licence.

I and many others have repeatedly pointed out that the label
'WileyOpenAccess' doesn't fit the CC BY-NC license they were previously
using. So this is a small but welcome victory for common sense and Open
Access.


Best,

Ross

Dear All

I'm in charge of setting up the call for this week. I am happy to go with 1330 as we have for the last few weeks but I am wondering as I will be in Cambridge in the morning but need to get back to Bath in the afternoon whether it might be useful to have it earlier so that those of us in Cambridge could do the call from one place?

Just reply to me and I'll get back to everyone later today as to the final time.

Could someone set up an etherpad at: http://open-access.okfnpad.org/26 ?

Thanks

Cameron

Hi all,

I'm forwarding a very interesting recent thread about fee-free
scholarly publishing started by Peter Murray-Rust with Rosemary
Laurent from INRIA [1], Richard Poynder, Peter Suber, Jenny Molloy,
Tom Olijhoek, Ross Mounce and several other OKFN folks.

Peter Murray-Rust's original email to Rosemary is at the bottom, as
well as some of the subsequent correspondence with Rosemary Laurent,
Richard Poynder and Peter Suber.

Basically the discussion is about how we can better document and
support 'fee-free' open access journals - which might include case
studies, a possible 'fee-free' OA handbook, publicity and community
building activities, and building a better 'best practises network'
with people and organisations who have done it.

We all agreed that - rather than continuing discussion in private - it
would make more sense to open this discussion up to others on this
list!

All the best,

Jonathan

I am not free before 1330 UK time on Friday. But can catch up from the pad
if you have the meeting earlier.

Ok - given that Mark can't do before 1330 and Peter won't be in Cambridge I propose we go with the regular 1330 time (British time, 1430 CET).

Thanks for the replies

Unfortunately, I learned last night that this Friday is my
turn to pick up our daughter from daycare, so I won't be
able to make it. This should not affect other Fridays...

Sorry,

Dear all,

I was asked to participate in a panel discussion on "Voice
of Russia" about Open Access. Apparently, there are two more
participants, most likely with an opposing viewpoint.

Anybody heard of this/also got an invite?

Any talking points I shouldn't miss?

I'll be there too (in the studio, in London).

Likewise I have little clue yet as to who else has been contacted. But I
have asked Olga.

Message-ID: <001f01cd7b88$2ffb00c0$8ff10240$@richardpoynder.co.uk>

Dear All,

I realise that this thread is a discussion of how to document and support
"fee-free" OA journals, but it might be useful to put in context the comment
below that 70% of journals listed in the DOAJ (in 2009) were no-fee. 

I say this because some might conclude on reading the comment that 70% of
*papers* published in OA journals are being published without a fee. This is
clearly not so. While some of the journals in DOAJ may currently be
publishing no more than a handful of papers, others will be publishing many
more. Indeed, for-fee "mega journals" will be publishing a great many more.
Thus PLoS ONE (which charges an APC of $1,350) is now publishing around
2,000 papers a month, and expects to publish 3% of the STM literature this
year
(http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2012/05/18/plos-one-a-personal-farewell/). 

Moreover, as subscription publishers increasingly embrace OA we can be sure
that they will be doing so by charging an APC.

As such, I assume that we have no idea at all of how many OA *papers* are
being published on a no-fee basis. (Or perhaps someone does have some data
here)?

Either way, list members will doubtless feel that this makes it is all the
more important to document and support fee-free journals. 

Best wishes,



Richard Poynder

Subject: [Open-access] Fwd: Fee-free scholarly publishing

Hi all,

I'm forwarding a very interesting recent thread about fee-free scholarly
publishing started by Peter Murray-Rust with Rosemary Laurent from INRIA
[1], Richard Poynder, Peter Suber, Jenny Molloy, Tom Olijhoek, Ross Mounce
and several other OKFN folks.

Peter Murray-Rust's original email to Rosemary is at the bottom, as well as
some of the subsequent correspondence with Rosemary Laurent, Richard Poynder
and Peter Suber.

Basically the discussion is about how we can better document and support
'fee-free' open access journals - which might include case studies, a
possible 'fee-free' OA handbook, publicity and community building
activities, and building a better 'best practises network'
with people and organisations who have done it.

We all agreed that - rather than continuing discussion in private - it would
make more sense to open this discussion up to others on this list!

All the best,

Jonathan

This is what she told me:

Many thanks for the links Claudia - your expertise and knowledge of Russian
OA is greatly appreciated :)

Laura (and all): as I understand it, the OA discussion will be pre-recorded
tomorrow at about midday onwards. Then broadcast much later that same day.

I or someone else can then post links to the broadcast to this mailing list
and the OKFN Open Science mailing list as and when they come online.

Help with publicity would definitely be needed.

On this occasion I'd also like to solicit some publicity
help for a German article to appear in the TAZ
(http://taz.de) this weekend. The TAZ is among the ten
largest newspapers in Germany, so it's a pretty big deal.

The article's also going to be more than just the few
paragraphs that so far appeared on the OA topic in the other
newspapers (which all dealt with the Elsevier boycott). I
haven't seen it, but it's supposed to be two pages long,
with photographs of yours truly even. The other person
featured in the article is Elsevier's "Vice President for
Gorvernment Relations" (i.e., chief lobbyist against OA),
Angelika Lex.

I'll alert you to the article, once I have it. Too bad it'll
be in German...

Many thanks for any help!

Bjoern

I'm probably stating the obvious, but the OKFN-DE mailing list would be a
great place to share the TAZ article :)

I don't appear to have access to the open-access pad subdomain either, so
cannot do it.

To: "Global Open Access List (Successor of AmSci)" <goal at eprints.org>


One of the factors that makes fee-free scholarly publishing possible is
subsidy funding, for example government and/or institutional subsidies.

In North America, a majority of university libraries provide hosting and
support services for journals that their faculty are involved in
publishing, as documented by: Hahn, K. (2008). Research library publishing
services: New options for university publishing. Washington, D.C.:
Association of Research Libraries. Retrieved from
http://www.arl.org/sc/models/lib-publishing/index.shtml and Taylor, D.,
Morrison, H., Owen, B., Vezina, K., & Waller, A. (2011). Open access
publishing in canada: Current and future library and university press
supports. Preprint, http://summit.sfu.ca/item/49

Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) has long
had an academic journal subsidy program, because in Canada and most other
countries with a very few exceptions, HSS publishing is not a profitable
concern. Today, this program includes an Aid to Open Access Journals
component.

One way that traditional subscription-based publishers have found to move
to full open access, is to move to electronic-only publication at the same
time. For a not-for-profit publisher, the costs of subscriptions often
barely cover the costs of printing, mailing, and tracking the subscriber
base.

Kevin Haggerty describes the bold move of the Canadian Journal of Sociology
to open access here:
http://informationr.net/ir/13-1/paper338.html

One hypothetical (but realistic) scenario: with free or very low cost
journal hosting (based on cost-recovery) provided by the organization, plus
a little bit of subsidy funding to help out with editorial costs (e.g. a
bit of teaching release time to clear some of an academic's time for
editing, copyediting), means that many a small scholar or scholarly-society
led journal can make the move to full open access.

This is an approach that I would recommend for the consideration of others.
Financially, this is much more prudent than subsidizing article processing
fees of large, highly profitable commercial publishers. A smaller amount in
dollars can help the scholarly society sector to survive and grow
(important for other reasons besides publishing, this sector does much
more). I would anticipate that the commercial sector will continue to
survive and thrive, but they'd have to compete - there is room for profit,
but not at the 30% profit margins that a select few have become accustomed
to.

best,

Heather Morrison

Thanks Daniel!

The original email was from Nathan Rice who I've cc'd into the thread, if
you could reply to him.

Nathan - Tom forwarded your email to the Open Knowledge Foundation lists,
we have some people interested in text and data mining on board so
hopefully they'll be able to offer some advice/assistance! We run periodic
hack days, in the UK mostly, but one coming up in Helsinki on 18 September
if you'd be interested to do a remote demo, at the last one there was some
work on content mining phylogenetic trees

                    Digital Research 2012

                    10-12 September 2012
             St Catherine?s College, Oxford, UK

                digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk

 Digital Research 2012 features an exciting 3-day programme with a great
set of invited speakers together with showcases of the work and vision
of the Digital Research community.  Here are some highlights of the
programme - please see the website for the full programme and
registration information:

 * New Science of New Data Symposium and Innovation Showcase (Mon 10th).
Keynotes from Noshir Contractor (Northwestern University) on Web
Science, Nigel Shadbolt (Government Information Adviser) on Open Data
and a closing address by Kieron O'Hara (philosopher, computer scientist
and political writer) - with twitter analytics, geolocated social media
and web observatories in between.  Also the launch of the Software
Sustainability Institute's Fellows programme and community workshops.

 * Future of Digital Research (Tue 11th).  Keynotes from Stevan Harnad on
"Digital Research: How and Why the RCUK Open Access Policy Needs to
Be Revised", Jim Hendler (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) on "Broad
Data" (not just big!), and Lizbeth Goodman (UCD) on "SMART spaces by
And for SMART people". Sessions are themed on Open Science, Smart
Spaces as a Utility and future glimpses from the community, culminating
in a Roundtable discussion on the Future of Digital Research.

 * e?Infrastructure Forum and Innovation Showcase (Wed 12th).  We
open with a dual-track community innovation showcase, then launch the
UK e-Infrastructure Academic Community Forum where Peter Coveney
(UK e-Infrastructure Leadership Council and UCL) will present the "state
of the nation" followed by a Provider?s Panel, Software, Training and
User?s Panel - an important and timely opportunity for the community to
review where we are and determine what's needed in the future.

 There's a lot more happening throughout the event, including an exciting
"DevChallenge" hackathon run by DevCSI, software surgery by SSI and
multiple community workshops - plus the Digital Research 2012 dinner in
College and a reception in the spectacular Museum of Natural History.
We're very grateful to everyone who has come together to make this event
possible, including e-Research South, Open Knowledge Foundation, Web
Science, the Digital Social Research programme, our Digital Economy
colleagues and the All Hands foundation.

 We look forward to seeing you at Digital Research 2012 in Oxford in
September.

This is really exciting. Be aware, Nathan, that if you come up with a good
idea (which you have) you are likely to end up making it work!

I am copying the three lists because this is still very general but we
should condense it later to more specialist topics.

There is a real need for coordinating content-mining. There are a  number
of threads:
* tools to systematically retrieve "documents", such as PubCrawler whcih
crawls publishers' sites. At some stage we shall press the button and
collect a large amount of metadata. This distributes very nicely with one
scraper per publisher (about 100 in science according to Ross Mounce). We
have scrapers for some of the major ones but will need this for others.
First one required is BMC (which is ultra-legal as it's CC-BY)
* protocols for content-mining - legal and technical
* collation of experiences and groups in content-mining. This is really
important. I've been hacking in this area for 3 months and I am not
connected with other efforts nor they with me (apart from about 3 bio-
ones). We need to bring content-miners together. Since a major barrier is
publisher FUD let's give each other confidence. Also the OKF's Datahub is a
great place to put Open results.
* collation of technologies. There are at least:
  - scrapers
  - PDF hacking (I have done a lot of this but we need more. Open font
info. Postscript reconstruction
  - bit-map hacking for diagram analysis (I am excited by the quality of
modern scientific diagrams and think there can be a lot of automation)
  - shallow natural language processing and NPL resources (e.g. vocabs,
character sets)
  - classification techniques (e.g. Lucene/Solr) for text and diagrams

I think if we harness all these we will have a large step change in the
automation of extraction of scientific information from "the literature".

And one-by-one the publishers will come to us because they will need us.

Timescale - about 1 year to have something major to report - about 5 years
to change the way scientific information is managed.

Thanks, Nathan.
No one is going to put pressure on you to do anything - but the
oppoertunity for jointly coalescing projects is there.

Then take things at a pace that can be managed. No-one has to be a hero by
themselves.

Generally it's split 3 ways - training, testing and validation. But such a
corpus is very valuable. Unfortunately copyright normally means it can't be
redistributed (I've had this fight with publishers). However that will
change as they realise that alienating the world won't work as they aren't
very competent totalitarians.

I work with PDFBox and pull this out character by character. I throw away
all sequential information and only use coordinates and font-size.  This
works pretty well for me. I can see some excessive kernings and ligatures
may defeat it but at present I suspect I get less than 1 spurious space per
1000 chars. And remember we also have vocabularies to help tune this.

We have been addressing this in the Open biblio project(s). BibJSON acts as
an unofficial normalization of article metadata. If you mean
domain-specific metadata then we have to do this ourselves - and I am
confident we can - it will be better than keywords (I have little faith in
them)

I looked at this 2-3 years ago - for clinical trials on nutrition. IIRC the
abstracts were very useful metadata - they were structured and used
standard-ish terms. I think they could be NLP'ed quite well.

Ultimately humans have to validate the metadata. You need an
inter-annotator agreement. In chemistry we found that the maximum agreement
between expert human chemists was 93% for whether a phrase was a chemical
or not. Machines by definition cannot do better than this.

It's tempting to develop crowdsourcing for annotation but it's important
that the crowd is part of the project, not just passive slaves.

Dear all,
Catching up this thread to answer on two issues:
1. Metadata formats for scholarly papers: this is something we have been extensively been working on in the context of the EU PEER project (http://www.peerproject.eu/) where we mapped heterogeneous metadata coming from quite a wide spectrum of commercial STM publishers onto a single TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) based format.  The format is documented under http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00659856 and we did a short communication (with slides) about it at the 2010 TEI conference:  http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00537302 Using the TEI (an open standards) as a reference brings the work on scholarly document into a wider corpus of encoded texts (see http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/ just to get a partial overview of the TEI community)
2. We (Patrice Lopez, CCed) developed an open source library of metadata, but also full text extraction tools which creates a TEI based representation of a pdf given as input. This could be particularly interesting for your work I think, and an opportunity to share forces there.  See https://sourceforge.net/projects/grobid/
Cheers,
Laurent

Sounds good - especially since we can use the PEER project as an effective
authority.  Mark, etc. - how does this map onto BibJSON? TEI used to be
SGML and very complex - I hope this is a subset and can be used as XML
without the need for an SGML parser.

Java - great for me! I'll checkout and look later but this seems very
valuable. This is exactly what we need to interface with PubCrawler (unless
you also have a crawler). We can then  download metadata from all the
publishers - we already have scrapers for several. That gives us the
metadata framework for then managing Open bibliography and using it.

Metadata formats for scholarly papers: this is something we have been extensively been working on in the context of the EU PEER project (http://www.peerproject.eu/) where we mapped heterogeneous metadata coming from quite a wide spectrum of commercial STM publishers onto a single TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) based format.  The format is documented under http://hal.inria.fr/hal-00659856 and we did a short communication (with slides) about it at the 2010 TEI conference:  http://hal.inria.fr/inria-00537302 Using the TEI (an open standards) as a reference brings the work on scholarly document into a wider corpus of encoded texts (see http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/ just to get a partial overview of the TEI community)

That was 20 years ago ;-). It now comes with a very flexible customization platform allowing you to dumb down things to your needs. [disclosure: I have chaired the TEI technical council 2008-2011]. Remember also that the TEI people have been part of the setting up of XML (e.g. Michael Sperberg-McQueen, co-editor of both the TEI and the XML rec. in late 90's). And it comes automatically with the Oxygen XML editor.

It depends what you mean by crawler. Can you say more about this?

In PEER, I was the one to develop the XSLT stylesheets from the various publishers' formats (ScholarOne, various versions of NLM, Elsevier, Nature, ...) to TEI. I have never managed to put this together in SF, but could zip this to however would want to push things further.

Indeed. I ran the XML-DEV list in 1997 so knew many people involved in TEI.

We actually worked on both scenario in PEER. So the software on SF work directly with PDFs and the stylesheets are there because we also got a huge amount of data directly from publishers.

Problem with material from publishers is that it is usually a one-off
provision of material and there are often legal constraints

Hi Bjoern and others on the list,

I have posted the link to the TAZ article of this weekend on the
@ccess/news. also tweeted via @ccess and alerted via Connotea (ends up in
oatp tweets).
A very nice article by the way

cheers

Excellent, many thanks! I already got an invitation for a

And the paper is great. It conveys so much the kind of feelings we all have.
I guess you're overcommitted now, but a lunch or coffee in Berlin would be great. [Ich bin in der HU eingesiedelt]

This clashes with  open-biblio - maybe they should rearrange?

Tom (and Mike)
I am presenting at VIVO - a big academic infrastructure and I REALLY want
to show them  your work and ideas and the plight of the #scholarlypoor.
There is a very good chance of finding some revolutionaries here. Also we
may be able to get open biblio into their system. Today I got a tweet:

"Open Biblio looks awesome, and I want to start using BibJSON right now.
Any ideas for connecting w/VIVO/Profiles? "

I am going to speak about "Reclaim our scholarship" taking open-biblio as
the key. I'll also point to @ccess and who needs access. Anything that
shows recent activity would be valuable.

OK - I shall be strongly promoting Open biblio and @ccess. Probably shall
have a window into tomorrows Etherpad and the web pages. Don't exactly know
when but I'll probably Open a skype channel and mute the speaker. Any text
on Skype will be valuable - I'll tell people that I'm listening in to the
open-access weekly meeting. I think it could be great. I shall promote
open-access as the leading true open access group that is actively trying
to change the world.

Tom / Mark - is there a good place to point to Open Malaria work with Open
Bibliography - is there a good malaria on bibSoup?

We've also had a good discussion and some possible interest on the whole open biblio issue here at the Ticer Summer School where David Shotton presented on open citations amongst other things.

Cheers

Peter, the malaria.bibsoup.net site shows a lot of the malaria open access
work - it is down right now but will be up by tomorrow.

Hi Peter,

The malaria BibSoup will be nice to show at VIVO. In addition the @ccess
website has a good link list (even showing VIVO !!)  and the news section,
plus the blogs (notably
http://access.okfn.org/2012/03/20/scientific-social-networks-are-the-future-of-science/,
 and
http://access.okfn.org/2012/05/17/open-access-not-just-a-matter-for-scientists/).
@ccess has also the section on open access success stories and
whoneedsaccess has very compelling stories as well.
On Skype we are in the process of discussing a role for @ccess in the
formation of scientist communities that make use of open biblio tools and
BibSoup for managing the information.
I sure hope you will raise interest for @ccess at the meeting.

cheers

TOM

Many thanks to Tom and Mark for skyping into my presentation (which went
very well). People were impressed. It came quite naturally - I stopped
saying what I was saying and we talked for 3-4minutes. It think it came
over pretty clearly through Skypephone and podium  mike.

   *Digital Research 2012*

 10-12 September 2012
 St Catherine?s College, Oxford, UK

  http://digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk

 Digital Research practice, tools and infrastructures have been embraced by
researchers across all disciplines. The landscape is changing rapidly, with
the Web as our research environment and also a lens onto our society and
world. Researchers across sciences and humanities are facing the
opportunities and challenges of new forms of data and big data analytics,
and harnessing the technological advances of new devices and
"e-Infrastructure" including High Performance Computing and the Cloud.

   *Digital Research 2012* features an exciting three-day programme with a
great set of speakers, bringing the community together to showcase today?s
digital research practice and innovation and set an influential agenda for
tomorrow. We welcome researchers, research technologists and developers at
all stages of their careers. Here are some highlights of the programme -
please see the website for the full programme and registration information:

 *New Science of New Data Symposium* and *Innovation Showcase* (Monday
10th).  Keynotes from social network analysis expert *Noshir
Contractor*(Northwestern University) on Web Science, government open
data director
*Nigel Shadbolt* on Open Data, and a closing address by philosopher,
computer scientist and political writer *Kieron O'Hara* - with twitter
analytics, geolocated social media and informational citizenship in
between.  Also the launch of the *Software Sustainability Institute's
Fellows Programme *and the community innovation showcase and workshops.

 *Future of Digital Research* (Tuesday 11th).  Keynotes from *Stevan
Harnad*on "Digital Research: How and Why the RCUK Open Access Policy
Needs to Be
Revised", *Jim Hendler* (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) on "Broad Data"
(not just big!), and *Lizbeth Goodman* (UCD) on "SMART spaces by and for
SMART people". Sessions are themed on Open Science (with a data publishing
panel), Smart Spaces as a Utility and future glimpses from the community,
all culminating in a Roundtable discussion on the Future of Digital
Research.

 *e?Infrastructure Forum* and *Innovation Showcase* (Wednesday 12th). We
open with a dual-track community innovation showcase, then launch the UK
e-Infrastructure Academic Community Forum where *Peter Coveney* (UK
e-Infrastructure Leadership Council and UCL) will present the "state of the
nation" followed by a Provider?s Panel, Software, Training and User?s Panel
- an important and timely opportunity for the community to review where we
are with the recent UK government investment and determine what's needed in
the future.

 It's free to attend just the *New Science of New Data* symposium or *Software
Sustainability Institute Fellows Programme* launch on Monday 10th, or
the *e-Infrastructure
Forum* on Wednesday 12th (thanks to our sponsors). Full 3-day registration
enables you to attend everything and there's a lot more happening
throughout the event, including an exciting "DevChallenge" hackathon run by
DevCSI, software surgery by SSI and multiple community workshops - plus the
Digital Research 2012 dinner in College and a reception in the
spectacular *Museum
of Natural History*. Please go to
http://digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk/registration to register.

   We're very grateful to everyone who has come together to make this event
possible, including e-Research South, Open Knowledge Foundation, Web
Science, the Digital Social Research programme, our Digital Economy
colleagues and the All Hands Foundation.

 We look forward to seeing you in Oxford 10-12th September to discuss the
state of the art and the shape of the future in Digital Research.

collections, Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning, and
research resources that reside in the public domain, or carry a license
that permits their free access and use by all users. Like the Open Access
movement, the aim of many OER proponents is for anyone, anytime, anywhere
to be able to access and contribute to the advancement of knowledge.

Since being ignited in 2001 by MIT=92s ambitious OpenCourseWare
project<http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm>,
the OER movement has rapidly grown in scope and intensity, with successful
projects initiatives springing up around the world. Over the past 12
months, OER=92s have achieved even greater visibility with adoption of the
2012 Paris OER Declaration at the recent UNESCO congress, and the passage
of the first U.S. Open Source Textbook legislation by the California State
Senate.

A panel of three OER experts will talk about these developments and much
more  - including the basics of OERs, the sate of important current OER
initiatives, the relevance of OERs to the library community, and the
intersections of OER and Open Access.

Featured speakers will include:

=95 Nicole Allen: Director of the Make Textbooks Affordable project at
Student PIRGs (Public Interest Research Groups)

=95 Dr. Daniel Mietchen: Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science at the Ope=
n
Knowledge
Foundation Germany;

=95 Cable Green: Director of Global Learning for Creative Commons for
Creative Commons

To accommodate interest in every time zone, this 1-hour event will be
recorded and available on our website shortly afterwards.

Please join us for lively and interaction discussion. For additional
information, contact SPARC=92s Communication=92s Manager, Andrea Higginboth=

        'rationing of publication and corresponding damage to the UK
research base' as resources for OA publishing are tight and likely to
become tighter.
         'UK scholarship will risk becoming provincialised' and our
universities will be pushed down international rankings=92 - this
doesn't seem to be based on concrete evidence or forecasting, but
rather on the observation that European and North American publishing
systems are not as far down the OA route as the UK (might they not
become the provincial ones?!), and
         HSS 'Journal articles tend to be substantially longer and to
have longer half-lives' than natural sciences, so need a different
publishing model.



They wrote this news item in response to the government's acceptance
of recommendations in the Finch Report 'Accessibility, sustainability,
excellence: how to expand access to research publications': This link
will take you to the Finch Report page - scroll down for some spirited
and innovative views on how more could be done to bring OA into
academic publishing: http://www.researchinfonet.org/publish/finch/



Hope this helps anyone interested!
