Dear All,

In a reaction to the speech of Junior Minister @SanderDekker, during APE2014, I have written a blogpost on the subject of improving the OA infrastructure in The Netherlands.
For those interested this can be found at http://wowter.net/2014/02/02/week-review-week-5-2014/

Yours sincerely

Hi,

I have a few (of slightly conflicting) comments about one statement in this:

"...I see one clear and present danger in the view of our junior minister.
If he accepts the Golden Route as the only route, it might lead to the
negligence of the Green Route and subsequently the deterioration repository
infrastructure in the Netherlands."

1) Repository infrastructure is really only going to be neglected if:
a) It's not recognised that there are other important uses for
repositories, besides storing final publications
b) Funds are diverted in order to (partly) pay for Gold APCs.

2) There is no good reason to abandon repositories in light of going Gold.
Given possible concerns about the future of publishers / journals, and
potential problems caused by changes of ownership for journals, then
repositories provide a useful insurance against copies served by publisher
sites possibly dropping off the net.

3) The big difference is that you no longer need to mandate deposit to the
repository - you can more effectively gather the content through direct
push relationships with publishers, or harvesting the content. And there
should be no license restrictions against that (e.g. they ought to be CC-BY)

4) Repositories can also serve as a platform for enabling additional
services - e.g. text-mining - across multiple publisher's content.

Now for the slightly conflicting:

5) We shouldn't be worried about maintaining repository infrastructure as a
matter of ideology. If there is no need for repository infrastructure, what
does it matter if it degrades? However, as I've pointed out, there are
other reasons to consider infrastructure to hold research outputs, beyond
making them publicly accessible in lieu of the publishers site providing
access.

*Training for Open Science in Europe - get involved! *
http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/training-call-2014/

*Call for proposals to host FOSTER training events on open access, open
data and open science*

The FOSTER project (Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research,
http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) aims to support different stakeholders,
especially young researchers, in practicing open access, open data sharing
and open science. FOSTER will support community training actions via two
annual open calls for events. The first call is issued in February 2014 for
events in June - December 2014, and the second call will be issued in
October 2014 for events in 2015.

Do you feel you can effectively train on open science topics? Can you make
a difference? We are now inviting proposals to host FOSTER training events
on open access, open data and open science to be held from June to December
2014. FOSTER will provide limited co-funding for events. With your help we
want to organize both engaging and instructive events that reach out to
diverse disciplinary communities and countries in the European Research
Area.

We are looking to support different types of training events and
strategies, ranging from short (one or two-hour) workshops, through to
summer schools. Some examples of the training formats and content that we
would like to support:

   - Training targeting graduate schools in European universities, e.g.
   summer schools, seminars, etc.
   - Courses for trainers/multipliers who can carry on further training and
   dissemination activities within their institutions, countries and/or
   disciplinary communities.
   - Workshops for researchers participating in community/disciplinary
   conferences.
   - Training in compliance with the open access policies and rules of
   participation set out for Horizon 2020.
   - Training in integrating open access and open data principles and
   practices in the current research work-flow by targeting young researchers.
   - Training targeting one of the stakeholders - academic staff
   (researchers and students), institutions (research administrators,
   librarians), research project managers, policy-makers and staff working  in
   funding bodies.

*FOSTER support*

FOSTER will provide assistance in shaping the training programme, selecting
training materials and speakers/trainers, etc. Co-funding for the events
will also be provided (such as cost of the venue, materials, travel of
speakers, etc.).

*How to apply and a deadline*

1. Describe the training goals, target audiences, budget needed and any
co-funding offered. Please fill in the application form which can be

Dear Mr Madhan,

The judging panel for the 2013 EPT Award for Contributions to Open Access
has now considered the nominations
submitted to it and reached its decisions. Unusually, the high quality of
nominations has led the panel to declare
a joint winner for the first time.

It is then with the very greatest pleasure that I write to tell you that
you have been selected as joint winner of the 2013
EPT Award for Open Access, following your nomination by Dr Francis
Jayakanth.
The joint winner with you is Rosemary  Otando, Systems Librarian, EIFL
Country and Open Access Coordinator at the
University of Nairobi Library in, Kenya.

We shall be in touch shortly with more information and to discuss how the
award can best be made so that your
distinctive contribution can be recognised as widely as possible.

With congratulations and every good wish
Yours sincerely
Derek Law

*Recipients of the EPT Open Access Awards 2013*

Posted on February 5,
2014<http://epublishingtrust.net/recipients-of-the-ept-open-access-awards-2013/>
 by Leslie Chan <http://epublishingtrust.net/author/chan_uts_6195ca_3606/>

The Electronic Publishing Trust for Development
(EPT<http://epublishingtrust.net/>)
is pleased to announce the winner of its 3rd Annual Award in recognition of
the effort made by individuals working in the developing and emerging
countries in the furtherance of Open Access (OA) to scholarly publications.

This year, the trust received 10 nominations from a broad spread of
countries (Armenia, Egypt, India, Kenya) and covering a very varied range
of work. The panel members were impressed by the high standard of
nominations, and in the end were unable to decide between two, so
declaredMuthu Madhan, India, and Rosemary  Otando, Kenya, as joint winners.

Muthu Madhan is Manager, Library and information Services, ICRISAT,
Hyderabad 502324, India,and has been highly influential in promoting Open
Access within the Indian research community and been heavily involved in
setting up many open access repositories - to date he has been instrumental
in setting up at least 10 repositories including one for data,  and in
developing  mandatory repository deposition for  all Institute publications
in two institutions [see for example http://oar.icrisat.org,
http://ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/<http://oar.icrisat.org%2C%20http/ethesis.nitrkl.ac.in/>].
His solid achievements in driving the establishment of 'green' open access
in India make him a worthy recipient of the award.

Rosemary Otando is Systems Librarian, and EIFL Country and Open Access
Coordinator in the University of Nairobi Library , Nairobi, Kenya. She has
led OA activities in Kenya, raising awareness among different academic
groups, and been instrumental in establishing the University of Nairobi
Open Access Policy and repository [seehttp://erepository.uonbi.ac.ke/]. In
addition she has been active in training, and in facilitating an initiative
which has led to the establishment of 20 institutional repositories.

In their own different ways, both Muthu Madan and Rosemary Otando are
playing critical roles in establishing OA in their different academic
environments.

The award will be presented to each of them at a suitable event later in
the year.
The panel also awarded certificates of commendation to two further
applicants, Mandy Taha, Egypt,and (jointly) to Tigran Zargaryan and Tigran
Zakaryan, Armenia.

Mandy Taha, Senior Librarian and Project Leader, IFLA Center for Arabic
Speaking Libraries in the Library of Alexandria, Egypt, has taken a leading
role in supporting and publicising Open Access in Egypt and Tunisia , work
which is already having an impact on OA in her region [see
http://www.openaccessweek.org/profile/MandyTaha]. She has participated in
training in Tunisia and Egypt [
http://alexlibrarians2.wordpress.com/course-program/congratulations/], and
established a series of seminars and talks to popularise OA among
University students and staff.

Tigran Zargaryan and Tigran Zakaryan, National Library of Armenia, Armenia,
have been active in raising awareness and advocating Open Access in Armenia
and have set up an Open Access journals' portal linked to a National
Research Repository containing all of the Armenian scholarly journals
published by the Armenian Academy of
Sciences<http://www.flib.sci.am/eng/node/3>
as well as repositories at other institutes.

Journal of Buddhist Ethics celebrates twenty years open access
<http://wp.me/p20y83-TR>

As 2013 was drawing to a close, the Journal of Buddhist Ethics celebrated twenty years of continuous publication as a pioneering and highly regarded online open access journal in Buddhist Studies and the larger field of Religious Studies. ... I am not fond of thinking how quickly the last twenty years appear to have flown by. But I am amazed both by the developments of computer and network technology in the interim and the insight of scholars who grasped early-on the potential of this technology as a medium for scholarly communication. ...

Hello,
My name is Angela and I'm starting my Phd program in the areas of Machine Learning and Diabetes.I would like to know if there is any data set that I could have access related to this area? This data set would be on diabetic subjects and would measure a variety of vital signs (Electrodermal activity, Electrocardiogram etc) in parallel with the invasive measurement of glucose.
I appreciated if you could answer my request,
Best regards,

*Call for papers*

*international conference *

*<<*
*Open Access and scientific research: towards new
values*<http://icoa2014.sciencesconf.org/>

*>> *
*Tunis, 27-28 November 2014*
*Organizers*
The research unit "Digital Library and Heritage", of the
*Higher Institute of Documentation* *(ISD)*, Manouba University, Tunisia
*In partnership with*
The* National University Center for Scientific and Technical Documentation
(CNUDST)**, *Tunisia

*Presentation*
While the Open Access (OA) movement, with its green and gold routes, has
reached a certain maturity in the world and mainly in developed countries
thanks to the policies of strengthening open access to Scientific and
Technical Information (STI) in all areas, it continues to progress in the
developing countries including  the Arab and African  states.
Indeed, the advance of OA in these countries was prejudiced by the lack of
awareness among researchers and policy makers of the benefits it could
provide in terms of visibility of scientific production, democratization of
access to research results and application of performance indicators in the
academic environment.
This conference is a contribution in order to propel the OA movement
globally and especially in the countries of the South endorsing reflection
on issues related to the role of OA in the valorizing of scientific
research. It tries to show the different approaches and policies related to
this new model as well as the feedback and the role that libraries have to
play in this new scene. The objective of the conference is to promote the
exchange of experiences, views, and research results between researchers,
academics, and librarians from different disciplines, on related aspects to
the new models of scholarly communication. It will be a good occasion to
discuss how to offer solutions to common challenges.
It will provide an overview on the latest innovations in the field of OA to
STI and raise awareness of researchers and different stakeholders of the
benefits of OA and get them actively involved in this movement. Moreover,
there will be an opportunity to build networks of collaborative work
between researchers from different countries that could initiate joint
projects.
*Themes*

First of all thanks for posting, Angela and I hope you have settled well
into you initial studies and research. I hope someone has an answer for you
but don't be surprised if not.

Finding data in any area is not easy. That's a major reason why CKAN was
started. Some disciplines (space, meteorology, some health) publish data
sets as such but most scientists either publish datasets along with a paper
or, more commonly, don't publish them at all.

I think in OKFN we should tackle this in the following ways (cf Panton
Principles):

* encourage the posting of data (probably most usefully alongside papers)
* help to create metadata so the datasets can be discovered
* push journals, libraries etc. to take this seriously (very few do)

and build search engines.

What we need is a search engine for science. Google etc. don't do that as
they don't generally understand the domains. The data should probably be
transformed into a semantic form (e.g. Jim Hendler created/discovered a
miilion+ semantic datasets in RDF).

But there's an awful lot of data out there already , which is why I am
pushing content-mining.

And the major problem is that vested interests (e.g. academic publishers,
reference works) don't want this data discovered and published because
their business models are based on reselling the information that we have
created and is already out there.

Angela,

You could try: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.html [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository ]. Search for 'diabetes' and you'll find 2 data sets on diabetes.
I'm not an expert in the field of diabetes, so I'm not sure if you're looking for this kind of data. Perhaps the data sets are too old.

Kind regards,

Hello,

My name is Angela and I'm starting my Phd program in the areas of Machine Learning and Diabetes.
I would like to know if there is any data set that I could have access related to this area? This data set would be on diabetic subjects and would measure a variety of vital signs (Electrodermal activity, Electrocardiogram etc) in parallel with the invasive measurement of glucose.

I appreciated if you could answer my request,

Best regards,

Angela Pimentel

Hi folks,

It's been two and a half months, so there's quite an amount of updates
stored up. I've splitted this update in two - I'll post the second half
next week.

Thanks to *Leonard Kirke* who identified several CC0 works and sources to
be added to the FOSsil Bank. Remember that you can always send me details
of libre works that are missing from the FOSsil Bank if you don't feel
comfortable adding them yourself.

Great work, Chris! As always.

I do not think Jono Bacon is involved with Wired magazine though. As far as
I can tell, the only connection is that the Wired editor-in-chief, Chris
Anderson, wrote the forward to Jono's book.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong please.

Hi Angela,

The diabetes consultant I worked for in York District Hospital in 1991 had
built his own diabetic record database on a BBC microcomputer, and there
have been many such initiatives since. As most diabetes care takes care in
the UK in general practice, which is highly computerised, I'd suggest you
get in touch with its research body, the Royal College, and see what they
can suggest:
http://www.rcgp.org.uk/clinical-and-research/clinical-resources/diabetes.aspx

If you're looking for clinical datasets to run machine learning algorithms
over, you might also approach the big diabetes charity that funds research:
https://www.diabetes.org.uk/Research/ . If you can explain what you need to
someone with an overview of all of major studies they fund, you could
then--having suitably briefed yourself by reading their  publication output,
and writing a focussed proposal--approach the principal investigator for
access to the data.

I dare say that the Scandinavian countries would have analogously
well-organised services, but I'm not so familiar with the landscape there.
Best of luck!

Regards to all,

D.

World?s first scientific publisher launches new open access journal
Royal Society Open Science will publish on the basis of objective peer review
The Royal Society has announced the launch of Royal Society Open Science, a new open access journal publishing original research across the entire range of science on the basis of objective peer review.
Royal Society Open Science will be the first of the Royal Society?s journals to cover the entire range of science and mathematics. It will provide a scalable publishing service, allowing the Society to publish all the high quality work it receives without the restrictions on scope, length or impact imposed by traditional journals. The cascade model will allow the Royal Society to make more efficient use of the precious resource of peer review and reduce the duplication of effort in needlessly repeated reviews of the same article.
The journal will have a number of distinguishing features:

  *   objective peer review (publishing all articles which are scientifically sound, leaving any judgement of importance or potential impact to the reader)
  *   it will offer open peer review as an option
  *   articles will embody open data principles
  *   each article will have a suite of article level metrics and encourage post-publication comments
  *   the Editorial team will consist entirely of practicing scientist and draw upon the expertise of the Royal Society?s Fellowship
  *   in addition to direct submissions, it will accept articles referred from other Royal Society journals

Royal Society Open Science welcomes the submission of all high quality science including articles which may usually be difficult to publish elsewhere, for example, those that include negative findings. The journal will launch officially later in 2014 and will cover life sciences, physical sciences, mathematics, engineering and computer science.
On March 6th 2015 the Royal Society will mark the 350th anniversary of the launch of Philosophical Transactions.
Sir Paul Nurse, President of the Royal Society, said:
?Philosophical Transactions was the first journal dedicated to scientific endeavour and introduced the concepts of scientific priority and peer review. Today more than 20,000 scientific journals around the world are based on these two key principles and it is difficult to imagine a research process functioning without them. The publishing model is continually evolving and it?s important that the Royal Society?s own journal offerings do so too. We are delighted to be publishing this exciting new journal. We hope that Royal Society Open Science demonstrates our continued support for open access publishing and a commitment to publishing research that benefits science and humanity.?
