Subject: [Open-access] Introducing myself and some things I work on
Message-ID: <A2FE8762EE55DB40BE770BE1FB0AA5ED10128CB8@DB3PRD0411MB429.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

I have just subscribed to this mailing list. I briefly introduce myself. Sorry for cross-posting this first e-mail to open-science and open-access.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the free University of Bozen-Bolzano (IT). My research interests include human aspects in empirical Software Engineering with psychological measurements, Web Engineering, and Open-{Access, Data, Source}.

I volunteered for the OKFN at the CKAN project (more specifically, datapkg/dpm and DataDeck) in the past. I sometimes try to help with some developing activities. However, as I started my PhD I began hitting paywalls, thus becoming more interested in Open Access and Open Science in general. I am exploring Open Access venues like the Journal of Open Research Software <http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com> and PeerJ <http://peerj.com>. Otherwise, I self-archive all of my research papers. Talking about self-archiving, I strive to advocate this practice, especially in Computer Science research. Incredibly, quite nobody knows about green Open Access there, nor on the right to self-archive.

I recently delivered a presentation at my faculty, called "What is self-archiving - and why should I care?" <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.806275>. Additionally, I developed rchiveit, a Web tool to spread the awareness of self-archiving among researchers (in particular Computer Science researchers). It is nothing else than a wrapper around SHERPA/RoMEO APIs. However, it looks "fresher" and it tries to just get to the point, by displaying the minimum amount of information. It is live at <http://rchive.it>. The website contains some text on why researchers should self-archive. From some feedback received, I see that indeed, it is helping some people there. On the other hand, there is a lot of space for improvement.

I would like to get involved with the OKFN Open Science and Access working groups. I think that the best I can offer is my experience as a developer (especially Web developer) and as a Software Engineer (my MSc curricula). I would also love to help spreading OA awareness in CS and other fields.

Another idea would be to have the OKFN as an "incubator" for rchiveit, in order to attract some development.

I look forward to working with you towards a more transparent science.

Hi All

I agree time is of the essence and have set up a googledoc, however I have
a morning in a molecular lab to look forward to and won't be able to
populate it until lunchtime - please feel free to plough ahead with
suggesting 300 words!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kgFHnG-HhstNbDE2AOX5LXNkqSOTyefy1LRpB2Rc328/edit#

No matter what we think of this journalistic piece (as Francois points out,
it was never intended as a scientific study and appears in the News section
of Science) the message is reaching lots of people from high profile media
outlets that open access means poor quality research rather than that some
journals do poor peer review and APC business models are a gift to
fraudulent publishers, so I think we should make some sort of statement
with other organisations who are interested.

I think the latter point raises some really interesting questions for a
social scientist to tackle with a well designed study, as Carl points out
in his earlier email:
"What is the greater potential concern here: that well-intentioned authors
are being deceived, or that demand from dishonest authors has created a
large market for dishonest publishers (possibly in an attempt to deceive
employers who assess their output by volume?)"

Please pass this email onto other people who may be interested/tweet the
link to the document. Even better get them to sign up to the mailing list -
now accessible from the front page of the website for those who find
mailman pages a bit old school:
http://science.okfn.org/.

Hey all,

Just to say that I've started to draft a document from OKF. I'll share this
later today as I'm just nipping out for a meeting.

Best,

Hey all,

Thank you ever so much for this thread and the suggestion of writing a
letter in to the Economist.

Taking this idea on board, and some of the comments in this thread, I've
quickly drafted a letter which can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/17cj70QbpdHUVHzG5HpN5GC49Um29SPeVMimTExidRYQ/edit

It would be great to get the thoughts from members of the community on this
draft.

We will submit the letter to the Economist, and sign it either from Rufus
Pollock or Jonathan
Gray (although possibly 'with support from the open science working group')
as we need a CEO/Directors name on it.

Best,
Michelle

Green Open Access as a survival strategy for libraries:

The academic library has, by default, tied its destiny to a service with no
realistic prospects of long-term survival. It has become a systems
integrator that stitches together outsourced components into a digital
recreation of a paper-based library. This horseless carriage provides the
same commodity service to an undergraduate student majoring in chemistry, a
graduate student in economics, and a professor of literature. Because it
overwhelms the library's budget, organizational structure, and
decision-making processes, this expensive and inefficient service hampers
innovation in areas that are the library's best hope for survival.

My deep concern about the Bohannon sting is not the methodology but the
motivation. This reads exactly like the "dirty tricks" of PRISM/AAP and
Dezenhall in 2007 where the AAP (to which AAAS belongs) paid a consultant
to discredit OA. "Open Access is junk science".

I have blogged my concerns and some links at* *

*
I shall try to ask this to the Science journalists later today in the video
conference.
