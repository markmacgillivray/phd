Hi Peter,


You said some very interesting things about the Creative Commons
Attribution Licence <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/> today at
the UK 'Historians & Open Access' colloquim. I was wondering if you could
share with us a copy of that legal advice on this matter you had acquired?

In return, I thought I'd point you to the advice put out by Creative
Commons themselves recently on this matter:
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/BIS_committee_UK_OA_Policy


It would be interesting to further hear your thoughts on this matter.

Best,


Ross

Ross - I have of course seen CC's statement. I have to say that I don't
view CC as a neutral party. In this statement at least they are acting not
as a provider of multiple licenses to users but as an advocate for one
particular license, and their stance takes for granted the *assumption*
that the more reuse of all kinds the better, whatever the nature of the
work. Furthermore they are intervening in the debate to the extent that
they support the funders' proposals at a time when they are still under
intense scrutiny and, in HEFCE's case, consultation. Note that HEFCE has
deliberately removed reference to particular CCBY licenses precisely
because they are aware that their relevance is still very much up for
discussion.

Since very many - by some accounts most - users of CC licenses opt for CCBY
NC ND, there is clearly a powerful user-driven argument for that form of
license. There are many good reasons why humanities scholars consider that
derivative use and other OA issues require careful handling, which were
rehearsed at the forum you attended (and in dozens of submissions to the
two Parliamentary enquiries - please read those!), but none of which was
really addressed by our critics, who tend to fall back on telling us of the
successful experiments that scientists have made in this area. Our point is
that we want to make our own experiments with OA for research that takes a
very different form than STEM research.

We are *not* on the whole against text-mining (which we consider perfectly
reasonable resource discovery), but we *are* against reuse which confuses
our words with the reuser's words, in forms that we describe as plagiarism
to our students. There is a standard academic way of using other people's
work - it's called quotation, and it is already available to reusers under
standard copyright terms through fair use provision. 'Derivative use' under
CCBY does *not* clearly require this level of distinction between the
original work and the adaptation, despite what CC says in its evidence to
the Lords Committee. I quote from Professor Lionel Bently, an IP expert at
Cambridge and also the RHS legal adviser:

I think you have identified a gap between what the licence says and how

In other words, CCBY asks the reuser to indicate *that* the work has been
adapted but not precisely *how*. It appears to be enough to say, X is a
translation of Y, or A is an adaptation of B, without indicating how, to
what extent, and in what precise ways adapted. For long works (which we do
write) comparison with the 'original' text is very difficult - believe me,
I have to do this all the time in trying to detect plagiarism amongst
students - and in the case of translations it is often impossible.

As the forms of words that we use are something more than just 'data', we
do want their integrity to be respected by reusers and at present we think
the CCBY NC ND license is the way to do it. We would be open to writing a
new license, of course. We will be holding a discussion with Wellcome and
other interested parties soon to discuss what kind of license can best
achieve OA while respecting the distinctive features of humanities
research. I would hope that, with the public interest served by free and
universal dissemination of the original, it should be possible to preserve
some protections for the intellectual property of the author, especially as
scientists are accorded patent protection (which no public funder seems to
have tried to impede as yet).

In the meantime, the humanities scholar in me remains very conscious that
debates of this kind are rarely a matter of 'fact' vs. 'misinformation',
which is the language that you and your colleagues were using at the forum,
but rather of different interests, different interpretations, and often
different outcomes. I am, as they say, relaxed about that. I think you
should be too.

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEwHpj-hQ5fZvW-fkcb78xU5e3WWvXbau2PHhbbwsLvaVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

GlobalNames.org is running a workshop in mid-April in Arizona to assess
the Attribution, Rights and Licensing of names and compilations of names.
At the moment this area is regrettably fuzzy and this causes real issues in
scientific research:

some taxonomic organisations do NOT provide open data e.g.

http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/info/copyright

http://www.theplantlist.org/terms/

http://www.organismnames.com/terms.htm

whilst others are open e.g.
http://www.canadensys.net/2012/why-we-should-publish-our-data-under-cc0

further details and discussion here on the TAXACOM mailing list:
http://markmail.org/thread/piqil5tsjntvzne7#query:+page:1+mid:piqil5tsjntvzne7+state:results

The aim of the workshop is a report that clarifies if and how we share
[organism] names.

We seek submissions from all interested parties - nomenclaturalists,
taxonomists, aggregators, and users of names. Let us know what (you think)
intellectual property rights apply or what rights should be associated with
names and compilations of names. How can those who compile names get useful
attribution for names, and what responsibilities do they have to ensure
that information is authoritative. If there are rights, what kind of
licensing is appropriate.

The submissions will be considered by those attending the workshop.


Contributions can be submitted
http://names-attribution-rights-and-licensing.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page,
where you will find more information about this event.

Thankyou

David Patterson globalnames.org I would certainly be interested in hearing
from anyone that has found this uncertainty wrt Attribution, Rights and
Licensing of organism names as an impediment to research. The Open
Knowledge Foundation may well contribute a submission for this workshop.




Ross

Wonderful - thanks Ross.

I would be optimistic (with no hard evidence!) that we will see a shift
towards Open. This has happened with GLAM (e.g. Libraries and Museums) and
it may be valuable for use to prepare arguments and examples of Openness.

In our own project I assume we can use these resources privately as
checklists even if we don't publish the lists and make our own
semi-definitive list of species-in-the-literature. Of course I am aware of
all sorts of error, ambiguity, etc.

Dear lists,

The Open Knowledge Foundation is organising a special Crowdcrafting Hackday
at the Centre for Creative Collaboration in London on Saturday 16th March
from 10:00 to 17:00 (GMT) in collaboration with the Citizen Cyberscience
Center and Citizen Cyberlab.

The overall aim will be to develop micro-tasking apps for Science &
Humanities applications. We will have several experts there on the day
representing http://www.epicollect.net/ (Imperial College London) as well
as the lead developer of Crowdcrafting.org himself - Daniel Lombra?a
Gonz?lez (Citizen Cyberscience Center). An opportunity not to be missed!

Participants are welcome to either join-in with a project development on
the day, or bring their own app idea/proposal (but if the latter please do
get in contact with us beforehand so we can better accommodate this).

More info here: http://okfn.org/events/science-hackday-march-2013/

Event sign-up (required) here:

Dear Peter

 

This is not about "notes in the pocket" but about creating a reference name server for all the existing names including links to their original citation. Names play the integration function in Biology and they are semilegal ruled by Codes. We thus cannot have somewhere on our computer a little cache where we have the few names we are interested in but need to have an open infrastructure.

Currently there are ca 1.9M species described, but no catalogue exists. The situation is furthermore marred by the fact that there are synonyms of various kinds, misidentication and thus tons of name usages. A chaos at best.

 

The good thing though is that we have movements to clean this up. On the one hand we have increasing large silos of names, like GNA; we have a Biodiversity Heritage Library that finds names in albeit often badly OCRed text, often in not very useful way, but that can change with better tools; we have initiatives to make names more useful, like Zoobank; we have registration of new names in Mycology (fungi), or electronic published zoological names. And we have an advanced publisher, that produces semantically enhanced linked  publications (eg Zookeys).

 

There are also some initiatives now on the way, some EU and NSF funded, to work towards this large ambitious goal. 

 

A decisive factor will be how much of the published record will become open access (ca 2,000 journals or books per year create fully or partially taxonomic content) and thus add to the growing body of open access text.

 

There is also a confusion of what is copyright (protection of a work) and what is protection for a lot of work (I worked on this all my life, why should somebody else have free access) or scientific advantage of having a compilation of names. Finally there is also the issue of database protection in the EU, though I think most don't understand this either.

 

For that reason it is important to show on the one hand the advantage of having access to this reference system and integrate it into the scientific publishing process. At the same time, it is worthwhile from time to time to remind that a discussion on copyright is better run by specialists, similar to have taxonomists make taxonomic decisions.

 

Cheers

Donat

Great idea and important direction ~

Some thoughts on approach: it might be most helpful to provide explanation and illustration of what can be achieved through an open approach along with information and education about how to achieve this. Note that while open licensing is necessary, to be useful requires development using open standards and formats as well. 

If people are concerned (sometimes rightly) about funding, what might be most helpful for them to move forward is assistance in making the case for openness. While there are a few publishers in scholarship that are prioritizing profit over service, there are also many not-for-profits that just haven't figured out how to make open happen. For some, the expanded value that they could offer by moving to open could be key to ensuring their long-term survival.

My two bits ~

Thanks for the heads up, Ross. We sent along the response below to Professor
Mandler and Professor Bently, and told them we'd also share it on this
list. We'd like to better understand their concerns, and wanted to provide
some clarifications from the CC perspective.

Best,
timothy


1. As a general matter, as Professor Mandler notes, CC does assume that
permitting liberal reuse of copyrighted works is better than prohibiting
it. One reason for permitting liberal reuse would be to facilitate
unforeseen new uses ? for instance, text and data mining ? to the extent
such actions are prohibited by copyright law in the first place. In
addition, it's likely the case that teachers who use parts of scholarly
articles and monographs in classes addressed to students of different ages
and educational level need to tailor them to the needs of their students.
That often means excerpting, translating and, to some extent, paraphrasing
them. We perfectly understand that it would be ideal to have only the most
sensitive and experienced translator attempt a translation of a work that
has both literary and intellectual merit, but before that happens, in a
class where the mother tongue of half the students is Spanish, if the
teacher isn?t allowed to make a translation, she won?t use the work. Thus,
the need for licenses that allow for creating adaptations.

2. CC does not suggest that any license can substitute for academic
standards of attribution and courtesy ? and copyright law is no substitute
either. Our licenses require that attribution be made as specified by the
licensor, together with a general notice that the original has been
changed, if it has. Different fields have different practices about how
uses made of the works of others are described and sources credited, and
those usages are not preempted by CC licenses. Neither a license nor the
reservation of all rights provided by copyright law protects against
misstatement or misrepresentation of scholarly works. Professor Mandler
says that the standard way of using other people?s work is by quotation,
limited to the length permitted by the fair use/fair dealing provision of
the copyright law. This is, however, often inadequate to an extensive
consideration of the work, so authors resort to writing their own gloss on
it ? with no constraints of length or correctness.

3. Professor Mandler makes a most fascinating suggestion about
experimenting with OA for research in the humanities and social sciences.
Some data should be available already ? for instance, the journal
Humanities, like other MDPI journals, publishes its contents under a CC BY
license; Digital Humanities Quarterly uses CC BY-NC-ND; and Studia
Humaniora Tartuensia provides only access, with no license at all.

4. Finally, to the extent licensing requires that licensees indicate that
the original work has been changed, we're curious to hear feedback from you
all on how adaptations should be noted. In the most recent draft of the CC
4.0 license (http://mirrors.creativecommons.org/drafts/by_4.0d3.html), it
is handled in this way:

*"indicate if You have modified the Licensed Material and if so supply a
URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material in unmodified form if reasonably
practicable;"*

Is this a viable solution? If not, what would be better? Note that this
conversation is currently up for public consultation, so we're really
looking for comments on it:

Subject: [Open-access] New Crowdcrafting App - crowdsourcing OA journal
	licence & copyright data
Message-ID: <CAJr+OExcVgiUMgZUs_Jwd65VG1-K4BBnoGjsbqFr9UkJPrK2XA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just released a demo of a new app on Crowdcrafting.org that Daniel
Lombrana Gonzalez has helped me create.

It's called *Is It an Open Access Journal?* and can be found here:
http://crowdcrafting.org/app/oajournals/

It's part of an ongoing project to assess what licence e.g. CC BY that Open
Access journals are publishing their articles under, and also who retains
the copyright of the articles e.g. the Author(s), the Journal, or the
Society.

The source code for the app is here on github:
https://github.com/PyBossa/app-oajournals
so suggestions for improvements & additions are welcome and should be
directed there.

Should you be interested in creating a similar app to crowdsource data on
something else, do give Crowdcrafting.org a look - it's completely free to
use and fairly easy to get an app up and running :)


Ross

PS I know DOAJ lists licences but I believe some of that data might be old,
thus we need to independently reassess this to keep it accurate and
up-to-date.

I've been looking for this for years. In short, this is difficult to come by. The estimates that are available vary by a factor of 4 (5 billion up to 20 billion)  and don't mention any sources and some sources that claim to know the data, are behind paywalls (up to $2K in some cases).

There are stats for German libraries freely available, links with evaluations in here:

http://bjoern.brembs.net/comment-n900.html

That's the best I could do, as an amateur in such things.

I'd be very, very interested in any solid figures you might find.

Good luck,

Bjoern

Thanks. These seems very difficult to find indeed. I guess a priority in terms of open information could be the exchange of precise contractual data in the domain of scientific information...

The best way to get this is probably by FOI/A. That way the public
organization  (and this includes Universities in UK) HAS to reply. However
many publishers will put confidentiality clauses in and I have not come
across a library which will seriously challenge this. My guess is that
Universities will then say "It's confidential". However it may be worth
pursuing this - it could depend on the precise wording of the FOI by
country.

Brazil (I think) purchases centrally for all Brazilian univs. I think this
is a good idea and suspect they get a better deal than most individual
univs who are probably overwhelmed by publisher salesforce.

As an academic librarian Heather Morrison has done a fair number of
big picture calculations over the years:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/economics

The most widely cited economic studies are by Houghton, gathered here:

http://www.cfses.com/projects/Easi-OA.htm

and Alma Swan repeated Houghton?s methods in the UK in Feb 2010:

http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/programmerelated/2010/howtoopenaccess.aspx

Mike Taylor wrote various articles about this time last year which
also tried to address the big financial picture, among them:

http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/31858/title/Opinion--Academic-Publishing-Is-Broken-/

Less big picture, but equally indicative of just where the money goes
in paywall publishing was Richard Smith's blog post, in which he
remarked that the "editors were being taken for suckers and exploited
more cruelly than the people working in fast food joints":

http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2012/07/03/richard-smith-medical-journals-a-gaggle-of-golden-geese/

an article that certainly reminded me that the heart of that fat crook
Robert Maxwell's business empire was the academic publisher Pergamon
Press.

So why is the information you seek hard to come by?

At the heart of modern business are two dark secrets, both guarded
intensely close to players' chests: what the customer is willing to
pay, and the various components that compose a price. That is why
publishers oblige libraries to keep their journal bundle prices
confidential, and that is why such pricing information can be hard to
come by as we try to estimate how much it would take to make the
world's scientific literature freely available so that all may benefit
from it.

I'm sure everyone would be interested to read the results from an
anonymous survey that enabled librarians to unburden themselves of the
secret knowledge in these commercial confidentiality agreements...

Maybe this would be something the OKFN could take on? Or indeed INRIA?

Je vous souhaite une tr?s bonne continuation,

D.

I like the idea of an anonymous survey for getting the data on costs of
bundled subscriptions.
Would SPARC be able to start this?
These figures would be very useful when calculating economic benefits of
open access

Message-ID: <CAN+1nMwZm+FryQZhgk6kMZu-kZubEb-RbUY=YLkunrP3N4UKZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear open science and open access lists,

We are launching a challenge today to promote the use of linked of
open data in education (the full announcement is copied below). I'm
hoping this is of interest to people on this list, as we are
specifically interested in innovative applications that can be used
for education in a university context. Please help spread the word and
let us know if you have any thoughts or ideas!


The LinkedUp project is very pleased to announce the launch of the
LinkedUp challenge [1]. This is a series of three competitions (Veni,
Vidi, and Vici) promoting the innovative use of linked and open data
in an educational context.

The LinkedUp team invites anyone, from researchers and students, to
developers and businesses, to join the first 'Veni' competition [2].
You can participate by building prototypes, demos and innovative tools
that exploit, use, integrate or analyse large scale web data for
educational use.

Some very attractive prizes are only one reason to join and
participate [3] in the challenge. It is also a great opportunity to
work with a large, documented repository of linked datasets [4] that
the LinkedUp team is putting together. The consortium is also able to
offer dedicated access to so far non-public resources. The challenge
allows participants to showcase their ideas and solutions to a wide
community of researchers and practitioners. For businesses as well as
researchers, this will be a great opportunity to present their company
and enhance their network. For people working in academia, the
challenge will provide a wealth of material and opportunities for
experiments and publications.

While the LinkedUp team already identified and connected many
educational and non-educational resources to work with, participants
can also use and connect their own material or other data sources.
Anyone is free to showcase their creativity and solutions as long as
the application is relevant to education in the broadest sense of the
word. There are also some high profile use cases of established
organisations made available [5] that can serve as inspiration for
innovative applications. Join today!

Dear all,

below please find a request originally sent to okfn-de: the organizers
of OpenSym (formerly known as WikiSym) have been asked by the

that.

Thanks for any feedback,

Subject: [okfn-de] Meinung zu Open Access Publishern
To: okfn-de at lists.okfn.org


Guten Tag,

es gab vor kurzem auf dieser Liste ein Reaktion zu unserer Konferenz
OpenSym http://opensym.org -- konkret die Frage, warum die
Konferenzpapiere nicht Open Access gestellt werden. Die Gruende sind
historisch etc. aber tatsaechlich wuerden wir auch gern dahin kommen,
Open Access zu publizieren. Unter den aktuellen Modellen faellt uns
aber die Wahl eines Publishers nicht leicht, wenn wir denn unseren
aendern wollen. Unten an deswegen der Versuch einer Liste von
Anforderungen. Feedback erwuenscht! Und danke dafuer schon einmal,

Dirk Riehle

Looking for Suitable Publisher for 2014

After reviewing our situation, we have identified the following requirements:

1. Reputable publisher (must). Obviously a must.

2. Established publisher (nice). The more established, the better, as
long as the open access option is proper.

3. Non-profit publisher (nice). Many of the problems in publishing,
including overcharging for open access publishing, stems from the
for-profit motives of the publishers. Thus, we prefer a stable
non-profit publisher.

4. Known in computer science (nice). With a strong background in
computer science, we prefer a publisher who has a proper reputation in
computer science. This requirement may become less important over
time.

5. Open access option (must). The publisher must allow for a proper
open access option. The cheaper the better as long as the publisher is
solid and has a long-term perspective.

6. Reputable license choice (must). The available open access licenses
should be widely acknowledged and should include the CC-BY and
CC-BY-SA families. A publication permission (no copyright transfer) is
also acceptable.

7. No copyright transfer (nice). For those authors, who reject open
access (or can't pay the fees) the publisher should only request a
publication permission rather than require a copyright transfer.

8. Allows for self-publication (must). With open access being an
option, rather than a requirement, it is important that the publisher
allows for self-publication (on the conference website and the
authors' own websites).

9. Reasonable and minimal service choice (nice). The publisher should
allow for the submission of whole proceedings only and not require the
purchase of additional editorial services (and impose consequent
cost).

Requirements 1, 5, 6, and 8 are musts, requirements 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 are
desirable but not required.

At present, the ACM Digital Library, our current publisher, does not
offer 5 and 6, which are musts. They have made a recent announcement
that they will provide these options, but details have not yet been
provided.

Feedback is welcome!

Hi,

I guess this needs some clarification.

WikiSym/OpenSym would like to offer an open access option for the papers 
published at this conference. Our primary goal is doing right by our 
constituency, the people who attend the conference. Satisfying the request of 
a sponsor is acceptable, if it is aligned with the needs of our community. If 
not, we will have to let go of the sponsor.

I sent this request to a smaller German list to get localized feedback. I 
intend to learn from that feedback to start a larger discussion on our blog at 
http://wikisym.org then.

Thanks,
Dirk

Dear all,
 I do not see the point of a reputable publisher if they already have their own reputation as a conference. Why don't they publish on an open public platform (e.g. http://www.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en ; which is anchored on an OA publication repository).
Cheers,
Laurent

Absolutely - Jan Velterop and I have been trying for at least 5 years on
the GOAL list. But we get publicly shouted down, often pretty crudely, by
the "Green" faction who are anti-licence and anti-definitions. "Reach for
the reachable" (i.e. put an "open access" copy in the repo and don't waste
time on definitions till the repos are full).

We have created the OKFN open-access list (copied) to reinforce the need
for clear BOAI-compliant "open access". Let's try to grow a community where
we can have proper discussion and creative activity of how to achieve BOAI
in practice.

And yes, if you want to give a positive push to open access in France (in particular in the humanities) take the 5 minutes to sign! ... and forward this further.
Thanks in advance,

Hi Laurent,

thanks for the advice.

The pros I see:

- I agree that we may not need the publisher's reputation any longer. In 
particular, if the ACM SIG (sponsoring organization) lends its credibility and 
does not insist on using the ACM digital library. Then we have the ACM stamp 
of approval anyway.

The cons I see:

- None in general, but the particular proposed site, scienceconf.org is not 
exactly promising: Typos on the front page, sloppy behavior, partly broken (in 
Chrome). Can't find much information about licenses and whether they are 
willing to accept a plain publishing permission instead of a license.

Cheers,
Dirk

It's a public initiative (supported by several French organization => explains the typos ;-)). The licensing scheme is open to the conference organizers, so you can simply put your favorite CC-BY there. The team can be reactive in improving things here and there, and the workflow has been tested by many conferences already. A typical case where public institution should join efforts on common infrastructures.

Is it restricted to the data provided via LinkedUp, or will any Open
Data do? In particular, we're using WikiPathways data extensively in
our education here in Maastricht. Would that do for participating in
the challenge?

While we hope that the data we curated would be of interest [1], you are
free to use any open data set for the challenge! In fact, we would be really
happy to see a submission building on an initiative like WikiPathways!
So I look forward to your submission and do get in touch with our team [2]
if you have any further questions or would like to discuss what you intend
to do. We would love to hear from you!

Thanks,

Sander

Subject: [Open-access] Invitation to Hackday - 15 April,
	London - OpenArticleGauge and tools for license measurement
Message-ID: <48141E33-35CC-455C-A443-7EDFAD552C94@cameronneylon.net>

Dear All

As we all know, availability of licensing information is a bit of a pain. It can be difficult, especially at scale to tell what kind of licensing a particular article is made available under, and therefore something of a challenge to tell what you are allowed to do with that individual article. 

On 15 April we will be holding a hackday and mini-launch for a new tool built by Cottage Labs and supported by PLOS. The tool tries to determine licensing at the article level based on a DOI or Pubmed ID and could be a very useful piece of infrastructure to support all sorts of use cases from determining what a user is allowed to text or data mine, through to a funder measuring compliance with their policy.

You can see the current beta of the tool at http://iioa.cottagelabs.com and you can see the code base at https://github.com/CottageLabs/IsItOpenAccess/

If you've got an interesting use case for this tool, a complementary tool, or just an interest in expanding the number of publisher plugins we have available then we'd love to have you along. How can we combine this with other work in the space and what are the things we haven't yet thought of that could be fun to do? You don't need to be able to code to take part!

Please reply to me so I can organise catering and start to collect some initial ideas together for the day. We will start around 10am at Jisc Collections, Brettenham House 5 and finish at around 6pm with the option of moving to a local hostelry to continue.

Cheers

Cameron

Dear all,

I wanted to draw your attention to a special collection of commentaries and
features that Nature published today:
http://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-publishing-a-new-page-1.12665

If you attempt to read some of the commentaries, chances are big you face a
paywall (examples with John Wilbanks's piece + one entitled "Advocacy: How
to Hasten Open Access").

Enjoy when possible...

This is the well-known open access irony effect: a miscellany of links
on the theme for them's as like that sorta thing:

https://pinboard.in/u:juliusbeezer/t:irony/

> Enjoy when possible...

Wilbanks' effusion is now available via his site:

http://del-fi.org/post/46445456345/a-fools-errand-annotated

FWIW, I think Wilbanks is insufficiently cynical about the motivations
of the FUD-ites, splitters, and one-note one-man bands who populate
the OA universe, some are useful idiots, some doubtless in funded
through the pockets of the legacy publishers.

There's a fair amount of money at stake and it would be extremely
surprising if it anything other than a filthy battle full of
corruption and lies transpired.

Ho hum!

Regards to all,

D.

Hi folks,

 It's been a month and a half since the last update, which leaves us with a
lot of works to get through ? so I've decided to split this update into two
(I'll send the second out next week).

 As always, if you know of works under public copyright licences (and,
particularly, under free/libre/open licences) you can add them to the wiki
yourself or email me and I?ll add them. The same is also true for
free/libre/open projects that are available for sale or are in the process
of being crowdfunded, which I tweet about using the hashtag
#FundFreeCulture.
*#FundFreeCulture*

 The OpenShot Video

Save the Public Domain Review!
<http://publicdomainreview.org/support/>($12,729 of $20,000; 31 days
to go)

Unfortunately, I missed the deadline for The Foundation for an Open Source
City <http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/open-source-all-the-cities> ($4,023
of $3,000)

Justin, the creator of a free culture boardgame called To the Barricades,
is asking for support to help him take art
classes<http://blackflaggames.org/free-culture-patronage/>? and will
create art in exchange. (free culture or free software licences
of your choosing)

The Free Software Foundation is still running a membership
drive.<http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/14uvro/the_free_software_foundation_needs_your_support/>
