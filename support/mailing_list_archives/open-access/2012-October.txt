Subject: [Open-access] Open Access in the UK: Reinventing the Big Deal
Message-ID: <005a01cda086$fb3579a0$f1a06ce0$@richardpoynder.co.uk>

Love it or loathe it, the recently announced Open Access policy from
Research Councils UK has certainly divided the OA movement. Despite
considerable criticism, however, RCUK has refused to amend its policy.

 

So what will be its long-term impact? 

 

Critics fear that RCUK has opened the door to the reinvention of the Big
Deal. Pioneered by Academic Press in 1996, the Big Deal involves publishers
selling large bundles of electronic journals on multi-year contracts.
Initially embraced with enthusiasm, the Big Deal is widely loathed today. 

 

However, currently drowned out by the hubbub of criticism, there are voices
that support the RCUK policy. Jan Velterop, for instance, believes it will
be good for Open Access.

 

Velterop also believes that the time is ripe for the creation of a New Big
Deal (NBD). The NBD would consist of "a national licensing agreement" that
provided researchers with free-at-the-point-of-use access to all the papers
sitting behind subscription paywalls, *plus* a "national procurement
service" that provided free-at-the-point-of-use OA publishing services for
researchers, allowing them to publish in OA journals without having to foot
the bill themselves.  

 

Velterop's views are not to be dismissed lightly. Former employee of
Elsevier, Springer and Nature, Velterop was one of the small group of people
who attended the 2001 Budapest meeting that saw the birth of the Open Access
movement, and he was instrumental in the early success of OA publisher
BioMed Central. 

 

Moreover, during his time at Academic Press, Velterop was a co-architect of
the original Big Deal.

 

More on this, and a Q&A with Velterop, can be read here:

It is loathed because it was run as a cartel by publishers. I have been
arguing that there should be a few central purchasing points , e.g.
nationally, and that they should regulate pricess (?and quality?). I think
Brazil does this and I'd be grateful for more info

<rant corrections="invited">
I am in favour of OKF-Open Access, of course. The really serious problems
with "Open Access" are:
* there is 15 billion dollars at stake so we can expect commercial
attitudes including dirty tricks
* the universities don't care about Open Access. They have done almost
nothing over 10 years. A few woolly pseduo-mandates. No cash, no
technology, no boycotts.
* the University repositories are awful. Run by the wrong people for the
wrong reasons and with the wrong technology (OKF could do this much much
better with Open biblio, CKAN/Datahub)
* The "open" in OA has been degraded by the Harnadites to almost
Humpty-Dumpty meaninglessness.
* the "Open Access" movement has disintegrated into a formless oligarchy.
Normal people are excluded (they are trashed, in public, onthe GOAL list
and only JanV and I have the bottle to stand up to this). They EOS
(Enabling Open Scholarship) is about as Open as a masonic lodge

The RCUK has inherited 10 years of inaction and incompetence from the
Universities who are clearly not to be trusted with this. The key thing
they have done is to assert that they are taking control. Whether they have
the details right is irrelevant.
</rant>

And I believe that OKF has something to offer and so have copied in some
funders. I think that Openbiblio is already close to having appropriate
metadata. And the related tools will help to create repositories that are
fit for purpose.

And (unlike GOAL whose Animal Farm sheep drown discussion with the bleat
"Gold is good but Green is be-e-e-etter") this list is open to all ideas
and encourages rational discussion and constructive solutions.  I am
neither pro- or -anti- Gold or Green - they are both approaches which offer
partial but nowhere near complete solutions.

In case you missed it there was a discussion on radio3 last night about
#openaccess which included Willets, Finch, and @rmounce. I thought the
discussion was good, impressed with how well Willetts (and the interviewer)
understood the issues and the way they presented their emphasis on Gold OA.

Anyone know if there is a recording?

I'm afraid I didn't appear much in the programme.

Dame Finch & David Willetts talked a lot of sense so I didn't want to
interrupt them too much.

I feel it got sidetracked into the relatively minor issues of humanities
research publishing (which I believe is only a small component of the UK's
total academic research output).

I'd be interested in hearing more about humanities research and open access
if anyone on these lists is involved in these areas. I got the impression
from talking with some of those concerned afterwards that humanities
academics are very drawn to *paper* copies of journals, and this thus
increases the cost of publishing for them.

Paper journals are irrelevant to me and my research - they are 20th century
reminders of how research used to be distributed. All I need is research
distributed via the internet to be read on computers, tablets, phones, and
other devices and hence I feel the cost of publishing research need only be
very small. I suspect the difference of opinion encountered was based
around this.

Best,

Ross


PS Since I didn't get to mention it on air: it's Open Access Week soon!
22-28 October: http://www.openaccessweek.org/    Help celebrate & raise
awareness of OA!

Although I think this para is aimed at universities I have copied this to
the OKF open-access list. This is a few months old and hopefully some
readers will find points they wish to explore. As with most OKF things we
are effectively a  community/meritocracy so that things happen, often
quickly, but not always predictably.

This conversation with Tim O'Reilly touches on various Open Science/Access
points and may be of interest to people:

http://edge.org/conversation/-39the-clothesline-paradox-39-

Abstract:
*If we're going to get science policy right, it's really important for us
to study the economic benefit of open access and not accept the arguments
of incumbents. Existing media companies claim that they need ever stronger
and longer copyright protection and new, draconian laws to protect them,
and meanwhile, new free ecosystems, like the Web, have actually led to
enormous wealth creation and enormous new opportunities for social value.
And yes, they did in fact lead in some cases to the destruction of
incumbents, but that's the kind of creative destruction that we should
celebrate in the economy. We have to accept that, particularly in the area
of science, there's an incredible opportunity for open access to enable new
business models.*

Great Jenny,

Yes - for me this is one of the major missions of the OKF - how can we
monetize "free"?  Tim is right and understands the dynamics of the web in a
way that few other publishers do. We need inventive ideas - some of which
will fail - and we need a wide range of partners.

Really exciting to hear about the Open Access debate looking at the
nuances between OA for natural vs. social sciences. If people are
interested in hearing the official response (not one that I
necessarily agree with) to the moves toward OA in the humanities and
social sciences (HSS) in the UK, follow this link to the British
Academy website:

http://www.britac.ac.uk/news/news.cfm/newsid/786

(the British Academy is the national academy for British HSS, it has a
fellowship of illustrious academics in these disciplines and has a
reputation for being pretty conservative):

Message-ID: <CAGyWN8aHUkOQQfJd9w19Y2t5Cguu+5ZWZF8SLSX2uGyLW_AGFw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

We had a lively discussion today on Skype with many participants.
I am writing this message hoping to reach more people who are willing to
help in developing a new strategy towards open science.

In the meeting we came to the conclusion that it would be very worthwhile
to contact other existing open access groups on the points of what they
think is needed to make an open science society become a reality.As it is
the open access movement is fragmented and different people / groups have
very different ideas on what open access is and how we could get change in
the direction of open science.

 Our ideas as a group are clear (see the website) and one way forward would
be to combine forces with these other groups.
As a first step we can find out what other groups there are out there , who
are , or could be supportive of the @ccess group's ideas on open access and
open science.We could then set up a collaboration with these groups , and a
good start for this would be organising a meeting .
Such a meeting would cost money but there are several funding possibilities
that we can explore.

The proposal is that @ccess takes the lead in this, and that we start by
searching for potential partner groups.
All suggestions, comments etc regarding this idea and names of existing
communities / groups to contact are very welcome

Heather

I can't help but feel you are attacking a straw person here. No one has ever argued that CC BY *defines* Open Access. Many of us argue that is a necessary *part* of open access as defined by the original BOAI and Peter Suber has explicitly said that was the originally intended meaning. The distinction between gratis and libre came later (see Postscript2 in http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/06-02-12.htm).

Under the BOAI Open Access is the free, immediate, and unencumbered ability to access, read, use, re-use, and re-mix a work. The license is merely a tool to help ensure that we meet these conditions. It is not sufficient and I don't think anyone has suggested it was but it is precisely as part of the mechanism for ensuring that commercial publishers do reach the standard that we want when they provide open access that it is most useful. DRM is a red herring. No policy would accept anything with DRM on it as acceptable OA. It's actually an argument for repositories as part of OA policy that it creates a testable functional definition - if you can put it in the repo under a specified licence then you're compliant with the policy.

What you are proposing as open access is some form of free access for certain defined purposes but it doesn't quality as "open" in any of the senses the word has been used by either the Open Source Definition, the Open Knowledge Definition, or the definition of Free (as defined by FSF and the Free Culture movement). That's fine, and you're free to argue for these things but there is a reason why these definitions converge (and a reason why they differ on specific details).

On 5 Oct 2012, at 01:22, Heather Morrison wrote:

I can't even begin to understand this. A primary part of my definition of research is that people can and will build on it. This might be through mining, aggregation, indexing, critique, translation, summary, all of which are derivative works. If you can't re-use work it isn't research in my view. It may be art, and perhaps more humanities scholarlship generates artistic rather than research outputs. But the public funding of art is a very different argument to the public funding of resaerch.

I'm not going to tackle the non-commercial issue point by point except to say that funders have an obligation to globally optimise outcome on investment and that is why they are shifting to requiring CC-BY. A major driver of the RCUK policy is the aim of supporting innovation including commercialisation and that's why thhe policy is structured the way it is. Infrastructure funding is an issue but the one thing we've learnt from study after study of the effect of restrictions on re-use is that requiring (or even encouraging measures to support) cost recovery is one of the best way of reducing the overall impact of your research investment. Many of the criticisms of various UK and EU initiatives have completely failed to engage with the aims of those governments which I think is unfortunate. I can see people disagree with whether the aims are correct but failing to engage with major stakeholders on their own terms is just bad politics.

If people want to do cost recovery on privately or personally funded research then that's their business. I think it's misguided in most cases because it generally leads to less local income as well as less global impact but that's something to look at on a case by case basis. But funders and particularly government funders are well within their rights to place requirements on the money they disburse. Researchers are free to not ask for money if they don't like the conditions. As with the NIH mandate there is always a choice - no-one is forced to do anything here but there are always conditions to accepting money, whether it be research funds or a salary.
 
> 9.   The CC-BY universe is MUCH smaller than the open access universe. Attempts to force CC-BY on all are, in my opinion, highly likely to cause a major divide in the open access movement.

Actually not true. I've been doing some analysis using DOAJ and Crossref as a data source and CC BY dominates the published OA journal literature. The numbers aren't perfect but as a percentage of all OA in journals that have a registered licence type with DOAJ that have DOI registrations CC BY is about 80% of the total. CC-BY numbers are growing around 20% year on year whereas CC-NC/CC-NC-SA are not. Obviously there are a lot of journals with no licence but they actually don't publish that many articles. 

As far as divides go, I actually think it's inevitable. As the movement succeeds  and changes policy it is inevitable that all the cracks in what was always a lot of different groups pointing in roughly the same direction will start to emerge. It's the nature of revolutions. In one sense its a good thing. It means we've won. That we disagree on implementation should come as a surprise to no-one, the agendas and aims are far too different for agreement to hold right across the movement.

As an aside I think its ironic that the objections that  often frame the discussion as how actually paying the costs of publication or requiring CC BY are inimical to the needs of the humanities, yet humanists (and social scientists) are always concerned that funders and government don't appreciate the impact they have. Actually I think the arguments are even stronger in the humanities that maximising impact through enabling re-use will help make the case for continued appropriate funding.

Cheers

Cameron

THANK you, Cameron. I've seen a bunch of anti-CC BY articles recently
(many of them by Harnad) but just lacked the energy to slap them down.
I appreciate your taking the time to do it so effectively ... not to
mention much more tactfully than I would have.

-- Mike.

Yes, I had that experience, too. My guess is that most people go
through an NC phase before having a moment on enlightenment. I must
blog about this properly some time.

I also was a sinner and then saw the light. My blog was CC-NC when it
started. I made the "natural" assumption that because I was an academic I
should use NC. We need to stop people falling into that trap before they
start.

I second that! I wrote to Cameron off-line, but am happy to repeat it here: 

"You are summing up and explaining the issues with an almost incredible, and enviable, clarity"

And Mike is right, very tactful, too.

As a side-note, you would probably get more fruitful discussion if
your (otherwise excellent) blog allowed comments. As it is, you can
hardly be surprised if your pronouncements seem to vanish into the
ether.

Of course, it's your blog and your prerogative how you want to run it.
I'll just say that my experience of blog discussions has been very
different -- for example, see this discussion happening right now on
one of my blogs, on the relative merits of publishing research as
preprints or in journals:
        http://svpow.com/2012/10/10/counting-beans/

One benefit of this form of discussion is that it leaves a permanent
public record, which I can (and often do) refer back to years later.

My perspective is that discussion via blog commenting is not fruitful - it's like having a conversation with a group, except you can't see who is in the room unless they comment, and even then, you have no way of knowing if they have left before you reply. I've done this myself, posted a comment on a blog then completely forgot what the blog was and never went back.

Spot on.  The altmetrics hackathon is about getting together ANYONE AND
EVERYONE interested in helping to build things that will inform future
metrics.  It is early for standards, but it is high time for experimenting!


There are scholars-turned-builders emerging from all over the place to help
explore the future of scholarly communication.  Jason Priem and I are two,
Todd Vision at Dryad is another, Martin Fenner now at PLOS is another, Mark
Hahnel of figshare is another, Elizabeth Iorns of Science Exchange, William
Gunn at Mendeley, I won't bore you with a laundry list but there are oodles
more in academia and out....
If we are publisher friends now, it is because we've found ourselves
working side by side to build real things :)

Please join us, everyone!  The hackathon is going to be great: San
Francisco on Sat Nov 3rd.  Everyone is welcome, whether you code or
not.  Register
here <http://altmetricshackathon2012.eventbrite.com/>, view ideas and share
your own here<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJixj2z6oSpFIosQQlGXFbrOBLR8te3VZgzdvcMedTA/edit#bookmark=id.atzvn4t9is2s>,
can't wait to meet you!

Heather

Dear all,
I remember PMR mentioning some figures concerning the annual budget academic institution dedicate to scholarly publishing (mainly journal subscriptions). Can someone remind me of a figure and possibly a source.

Just to give some context, I am working on a project of a free publishing platform based on HAL (epi-journal) for the computer science domain (for the time being and because of the background of my institution, Inria). If some of you want to join by bringing in potential journals, all the better.

Cheers,
Laurent

See "The STM Report: an overview of scientific and scholarly journal
publishing" at
http://www.stm-assoc.org/2009_10_13_MWC_STM_Report.pdf

page says that "The annual revenues generated from English-language
STM journal publishing are estimated at about $8 billion in 2008, up
by 6-7% compared to 2007, within a broader STM publishing market worth
some $16 billion."

For some disturbing maths based on this figure, see

This is an area where precise figures are difficult to find. Publishers may
give their overall revenues to the taxman but they aren't normally broken
down. So it's hard to say how much of ACS revenue is journals, how much
Chemical Abstracts.

There are lots of grey areas. What is a journal? what is a monograph in a
series? (Some monographs can sell for several thousand USD). And reprints -
this is very profitable in medicine and I seem to remember that one paper
has been reputed to bring in a million dollars in reprints.

I generally say 15 Billion USD and haven't been challenged. FWIW the
world's public funding for STM seems to be about 300 B USD (very crude
figure). This means that publishing is about 5% of research costs. Wellcome
area prepared to pay about1-2% of research grants for publication. This
gives a useful indication of the overpricing by the current providers.

P.

1 billion in modern English is 10power9

Yes - I used this when I was a child - Free Online Dictionary:
mil?liard  (mlyrd, -y?rd, ml-?rd)
*n.* *Chiefly British*
The cardinal number equal to 109.

[French, from Old French milliart, from milion, *million*; see * million*.]

 But the issue is still that we are paying much too much as there is no
regulation and no market control

Hey there,

With next week being Open Access week, we'd like to run a piece on
blog.okfn.org about the future of open access. It would be a collection of
quotes and comments from different people. Would anyone on here be up for
contributing something? Just a couple of sentences or a short paragraph
would be ace. Email me on or off-list, and let me know if you think there's
anyone in particular I should contact for comments!

All the best,

Theodora Middleton

Message-ID: <CAMuj-e+-VGryJFFY=Z3RA5BXQUS5n=qt_nBp3V2J4AL6CVhxig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Please enjoy another FOSsil Bank update. This one is a bit unusual because
I've dug up a lot of #FundFreeCulture stuff and relatively few new wiki
entries.
Helping out the Bank

If you wanted to help out the FOSsil Bank, you could add the remaining
books from Open Book Publishers <http://www.openbookpublishers.com/> to the
FOSsil Bank. I?ve only done the libre books (*Is Behavioral Economics Dead?*,
*Frontier Encounters*, *Oral Literature in Africa* and *The Digital Public
Domain*) but it would be useful to have the others as well.


If you?d like to help out with that, there?s a
tutorial<http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/tutorial>and you can see the
current list of Open
Book Publishers
<http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/source:open-book-publishers>entries on
the wiki.
#FundFreeCulture: New and Ongoing

   - Take On Magic
Items<http://www.bradsucks.net/albums/guess-whos-a-mess/>($2.50; CC
BY)
   - Brad Sucks, ?Guess Who?s a
Mess?<http://www.bradsucks.net/albums/guess-whos-a-mess/>(name your

being ransomed on IndieGoGo, although as far as I can tell only the
   engine will be libre licensed and not the assets ($705/$1,500; 16 days
   left; Give It Your Own License, License)
   - Bejewelled-style TumbleGonk <http://www.indiegogo.com/tumblegonk> is
   being ransomed on IndieGoGo, and the assets will also be licensed.
   ($20/$850; 8 days left; CC BY, GNU GPL)
   - The colour and black-and-white art of the African-themed Spears of the
   Dawn RPG<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1637945166/spears-of-the-dawn-rpg>will
be released into the public domain for others to use. ($6,687/$3,000;
   17 days left; public domain)

   publishing system for video, images and audio. ($18,382/$60,000; 19 days
   left; GNU AGPL)
   - One Shot<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sandandsteam/one-shot-a-roleplaying-game-of-murder-and-vengeanc>is
a new tabletop RPG on Kickstarter from open gaming stalwart Tracy
   Barnett. ($1,378/$3,000; 14 days left; CC BY-SA)

#FundFreeCulture: Update

   - Knocking Duh Conch Style II
<http://www.indiegogo.com/kdcsfilming>received the $50 that it was
funded.
   - Terms of Service ? Didn?t
Read<http://www.indiegogo.com/terms-of-service-didnt-read>received the
?20,736
   it was funded, double its threshold.

Fund Proprietary Shareable Works

There are two days left for the Humble eBook
Bundle<https://www.humblebundle.com/>,
and though there are sadly no libre works on offer there is xkcd: volume 0
(CC BY-NC), Pirate Cinema (CC BY-NC-ND), Magic for Beginners (CC BY-NC-SA),
Stranger Things Happen (CC BY-NC-SA), Save Yourself, Mammal! (CC BY-NC) and
The Most Dangerous Game (CC BY-NC). You can adjust where your contribution
goes, so I sent mine only to authors of CC works.
Libre Works

   - Open Book Publishers has a collection of books under shareable works
   licences. I?ve only added the libre ones to the wiki so far (they also
   publish Oral Literature in Africa and The Digital Public Domain, which were
   already on the wiki):
      - Is Behavioral Economics

      with stories from the open source community.
      - Open Minded CEOs<http://fossilbank.wikidot.com/work:open-minded-ceos>,
      stories about CEOs who work with open source.

good to see this is finally reaching a campus that, despite its

For those involved in explaining/promoting open access (particularly to
grad students/early career researchers), PhD comics have produced an 8min
animation:

http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1533

It's the first time I've seen anything open access related posted in our
department grad Facebook group by someone other than me! Jorge Chan has a
massive following among grads particularly in the sciences so hopefully it
will get plenty of views.

It's CC-BY (of course) so share away.

Hello All,

It's already been such a lively, interactive, and productive Open Access
Week 2012. And now the Right to Research Coalition just launched an amazing
video in collaboration with PhD Comics to really wrap up the week nicely.
The video entitled ?Open Access Explained!? is the perfect resource to give
colleagues a quick glimpse into the many reasons why Open Access to
research is important for students, researchers, and so many other
stakeholders.

Please take a look, pass around, use in your remaining OA Week events, and
post: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY&feature=player_embedded

Happy OA Week to you and yours. We hope to have an informational wrap up of
the many events that took place (and continue to take place) this week!
Speaking of which don't forget to keep the posts of your events up to date
on our Open Access Week Website.

Best,

Andrea

Subject: [Open-access] The OA Interviews: Ian Gibson,

	Committee
Message-ID: <003101cdb68d$2a5993d0$7f0cbb70$@richardpoynder.co.uk>

Like all successful movements, Open Access (OA) has experienced a number of
milestone events. Amongst the more significant of these were the creation of
the physics preprint repository arXiv in 1991, the 1994 Subversive Proposal,
the 2002 Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), and the introduction in
2005 of the first  Open Access Policy of the US National Institutes of
Health (NIH).

 

However, one of the more interesting but less celebrated events in the
history of OA is surely the 2004 Inquiry into scientific publication
conducted by the UK House of Commons Science & Technology Committee. The
inquiry seems particularly noteworthy in the wake of this year's
controversial Finch Report, and the new OA policy that Research Councils UK
(RCUK) announced in response ...

 

... Given the very different conclusions that the Finch Committee had
reached earlier this year, I became keen to find out more about the origins
and the process of the 2004 Inquiry. So I contacted Dr Ian Gibson, the then
Chairman of the Science & Technology Select Committee, and Labour MP for
Norwich North. To my delight, he agreed to do an interview with me ...

I can recommend in-depth reading of Ian's chairing of the Select Committee.
He pulled no punches and it is one of the most forceful public dialogues in
Open Access

Message-ID: <87wqy7fzl5.fsf@pobox.com>


Dunno if this is OT for this group, but ... has anyone done a brief
howto or guide to bibliography/citation sharing? Mendeley is probably
the obvious option, but there are other (and IIUC freer) mechanisms,
e.g., Zotero groups

http://www.zotero.org/groups/browse

but I'm guessing (knowing little in this space) there are more.

apologies if there's a better channel for this question,
otherwise TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

How about Citeulike?

That's very quite open I think.

Very good for discovering what other people have bookmarked/saved.

For example my modest collection of papers on Open Access (just a subset of
what's out there in the literature no doubt!):
http://www.citeulike.org/user/rossmounce/tag/open_access

likewise Open Data: http://www.citeulike.org/user/rossmounce/tag/open_data

and Open Science: http://www.citeulike.org/user/rossmounce/tag/openscience

Citeulike's not that popular admittedly, but personally, I like it.

Ross :)

It's perfectly reasonable. I share concerms about closed operations such as
Mendeley.
I have copied in the Open-bibliography list.

We started a wiki page about reference management tools, then found
wikipedia had one already:

Zotero is far more open than Mendeley. Mendeley would not be my option.
Here is my public library : https://www.zotero.org/marind/items/

True, but I thought the link may be useful to inform the discussion anyway.

Of course, for reference sharing, there will soon be the new bibsoup - it
is not working properly at the moment as I move it to new hosting. But will
be back soon...

Since references are text, you can also simply use a revision management
system like svn/git. I actually put up all the literature references
I've read/used on github:
https://github.com/langner/library
