What we should be able to do right now (and for some of that we're applying for grants as I type this), is to start building the infrastructure for software and data. This will provide the opportunity to develop standards for how to make the databases for text (repositories), data and software interoperable.

Simultaneously, these standards need t be communicated and adopted by a critical mass of institutions.

But perhaps most importantly, the institutions participating in crawling and harvesting all our literature need to develop a way of searching, filtering and sorting not only the existing literature, but especially the incoming, new literature in a way that is superior to what we have now. Given that there isn't really a single place where you can exhaustively search the literature, the first part should be easy (existing literature).

For the second part, (incoming, newly published literature), we're currently in the process of developing an RSS reader which is tailor-made for scientists.

Thus, if there is a superior way to handle the literature, that outcompetes everything we have right now (again, not too difficult), people will go there, simple because they save time and effort that way.

The next step will be an authoring tool that allows collaborative writing with scientific referencing and peer-review. there are currently several initiatives developing that environment. Once this is running, submission will be as simple as hitting 'submit'. Everybody who has ever submitted to a journal knows how people will flock to a service that allows submission with a single click.

Thus, I agree, this will be the important part, but offering a superior way should do most of the work - just look at how quickly GScholar was accepted.

Cheers,


Bjoern

I agree with what Bjoern and Mark have said. We have the imperative to
develop a new set of tools and most is in place.

For my part I am launching "the Content Mine" over these current days. The
goal is simple - to extract 100,000,000 million facts from the scholarly
scientific literature. See

https://vimeo.com/78353557 (5 minutes video).
http://www.slideshare.net/petermurrayrust/the-content-mine-presented-at-uksg

and innumerable current blogs on
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/

I would very much welcome help. I have been offered some from outside
academia - it would be nice to have some academics who also believed in
liberation.

This is not vapourware. I demo'ed this at OKFN/Open Science in Oxford last
Wednesday. I am starting with "Open Access" papers, such as PLoSONE and
when tested there will move to other outlets. These papers can be queried
for a wide range of scientific facts such as species (where we start),
chemicals, sequences, geolocations, identifiers, phylogenetic trees, etc.
We have means of publishing this and means of capturing it. Everything -
code, protocols, extractions, stores, etc. are fully Open (OKD compliant).

This has the potential to act as a semantic current-awareness system and
also as a scientific search engine. At present there is no Open search
engine for science, except Wikipedia. As Bjoern and Mark have made clear we
must create one - and rapidly. Else we shall remain completely reliant on
the charity of mega-corporations - do we trust them?

I have applied for a personal grant to work on this. I will be delighted to
work with any others outside or inside academia - all my software is Open
for anyone to re-use without my permission. Only by making science
immediately Open (OKD-compliant) at the time it is published do we have
Open Access in the true (BOAI) sense of the word.

Hi all!

We'd like to get people's input on how the Open Knowledge Foundation can
better serve you. This community survey will take about 10 minutes to
complete:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dCH7omEGGqhNq5JiBGdW-6sbFw6LKDlMS3Wa-1mfnCE/viewform

We'll close it off on December 13th and share the results in the new year.

The survey is in English, and we'd love to get it translated into other
languages - so please contact me off list if you can help with this.

Thanks a lot!
Michelle

"Science, Technology and Society in the Light of Niels Bohr's Thoughts

The University of Copenhagen is gathering international researchers and
decision-makers to explore how open access to information and scientific
cooperation can help us manage global problems. The conference will focus
on contemporary challenges in bioethics, economics, politics, climate,
warfare and information technology. We ask:

? Is open access to information the answer to challenges from
new technologies?
? What initiatives can improve the relationship between science and
politics?

*The action - a new open letter*
In 1950 Niels Bohr wrote an open letter to the
UN<http://www.nba.nbi.dk/files/gym/leth.htm> in
which he urged world leaders to address the challenges of new technologies.
His ideal was ?an open world? with free sharing of knowledge and
international co-operation. The conference reinvigorates Bohr?s vision, and
will conclude by writing a new open letter to the UN."

More information here: http://bohr-conference2013.ku.dk/

Is someone here going?

Dear All

OKF have been invited to participate in Open Repositories 2014 in Helsinki,
Finland, 9-13 June 2014.

Are any of you already planning to attend and/or might be interested in
running a workshop?

The initial idea is a workshop looking at CKAN as a research data
repository but many of the themes fit with interests of working group
members so do feel free to suggest alternative topics or volunteer for this
one! Per the website http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=281, the conference
organisers are particularly interested in:


   - Unconventional approaches to repository-like services
   - Interconnection between publishers and repositories
   - Researcher-centered design for scholarly workflows
   - Adaptations to support curation lifecycle management, e.g., for
   research data
   - Real-world scalability and performance stories: working at web-scale,
   with big data for global usage
   - Requirements for holding restricted or classified data in repositories
   - Infrastructure to accommodate national and international mandates for
   data management and open access
   - Positioning repositories closer to (local, consortial, or cloud-based)
   cyberinfrastructure for data processing
   - Leveraging connections to external services including:
      - Remote identifier services (e.g., DOI, ORCID)
      - (Re-)using repository data/metadata in new and unexpected ways,
      including integrated discovery
      - Scholarly social media services, such as for annotation, review,
      comment, reputation, citation, and altmetrics
      - CRIS and research management systems
      - Digital preservation tools, services & infrastructure
   - Community and sustainability in an open world

What are your thoughts?

Jenny

I have just started using CKAN in this way and think it has potential. See
http://datahub.io/dataset/species-in-articles-from-biomedcentral/resource/ca3cfd1c-1239-49f0-8eeb-68d96d739d3a

I know some of the Open Repositories community - I think that we might get
a reasonable turn-out. We would not deliberately limit it to science but I
think science is easier to start off with. My personal interests would
include:

* problems of legacy data formats
* adding structure to semi-structured data
* indexing,particularly domain-specific information

I am interested and happy to work with others who want to present something

Potentially the Open Access Button team might be interested in this.

We'd like to make repositories a big part of the tool. We're currently
tossing around ideas (some concrete some not) around leveraging databases
like openDOAR (and the repositories indexed there) as a way to give our
users access to papers, and building in ways to promote researchers
depositing papers. One of our dev team is also wanting to create a way for
authors to submit open access versions of papers directly to us - which, if
it worked would almost create a repository-type system.

Thanks,

Joe

My personal feeling is that the current generation of repositories (V1?)
have concentrated on deposition and are very poor at discovery, indexing,
search, etc. Their motivation is often driven by University management
procedures (e.g. REF in UK) and not by use.

So I would love to see a user-facing repository - one that people outside
the University and its library *wanted* to use. I'd like to see this built
on present thinking (GitHub, Wikipedia, StackOverflow) not the repository
technologies in current use (EPrints, DSpace - I put 200000 objects in my
DSpace and can't get them out as the architecture doesn't allow it).

Also I'd love to see a repository which was independent of a given
institution. Part of the current problem is that every university feels it
has to have one, rather than having a few global approaches.

We have to be able to search it on our terms, so we have to develop our own
search technologies. That is why I am looking at CKAN as it has a lot of
users and many of them effectively pay for it. But it may be only a
learning exercise.

YES!

- Repositories must become the first (and eventually only) way to get scientific literature: global search for all scientific literature from 1664 to today.

- New (OA) literature needs to be harvested automatically, not deposited by author by hand.

This is the future we should have had 10-20 years ago...

Yes. I have tried to get this idea across  to the conventional repository
community with little success. There should be only one (or at best a few)
entry points. I have suggested a repository for all UK funded Open output
including papers, theses and data. That in itself is technically too
limiting but it can catch the political imagination.(Some countries such as
NL (SURF) do this much better).

Yes. 1995 would have been the time to start - 2 years after the WWW took
off, when most of the web was open and based on public institutions. It's
also the time at which we should have seen innovative approaches to
publishing. Now we have to break free of the quagmire of academic
aspirations.

There have already been efforts to use CKAN in this way, which should be
referred to:

http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2012/09/06/choosing-ckan-for-research-data-management/

Known issues include the metadata quality capability.


Regarding the issue of deposit into a repository, it is possible with SWORD
2.0 to build such deposit functionality, and I demonstrated such a
"deposit" button at least two years ago at a previous OR conference.
However, it has never been implemented on a live repository.

Of particular interest in this regard, during recent work on my phd I have
found that one of the reasons this functionality has never been implemented
at my university at least is because I am the first Edinburgh academic ever
to have requested such capability.

Of course this comes down to an issue of knowing what can be done, knowing
how to do it, and the complex of responsibilities involved across
communities, and having people come to a consensus on the key requirements.
This is all of relevance to my phd study, and so I would ask again that if
any of you wish to clarify what these requirements are, that you complete
my scholarship survey and share it widely and encourage further feedback:

http://ifthisistheanswer.com/survey

Next year I (with Cottage Labs) intend to use my work as a basis for
developing and running a service to help solve this problem. Any of you
wishing to contribute will of course be welcome - and note that as I have
said before it is not actually technical capability that is the key
(although it is of course important), but community development, support,
leadership, advocacy, politics.

There is effectively no user-base for current repositories so there is no
pressure on developers to provide them. It's a cyclic argument.
Universities rely on G**gle (who are now teamed up with Th*ms*n - R**t*rs)
- do you trust this combination to provide what we really want?

It's shameful IMO that universities have spent (my estimate) 500 Million
USD on repositories [*] and they are basically unsearchable without G**gle.

P.

[*] 1500 research active universities (guess) * 2 FTEs (Peter Suber
estimated 1.5-5 FTEs) * 10 years =30,000 FTEs

I guess my estimate is low...

Unfortunately no - repo systems like dpsace and eprints do, but not CKAN
yet. We have looked at it and it would not be hard, but it has not been
done yet, mainly because CKAN has never focussed on being an academic repo
before so has not needed to grok SWORD.

CKAN has its  own API so if there is a Java client I'll use that - I don't
think SWORD gives a technical advantage - it might give a political one.

SWORD is a technically superior solution, because it's a single
protocol that can be implemented by multiple clients and multiple
servers in an interoperable way. A client developed to use any given
repo's own API will be be re-usable elsewhere.

Hi All

[Cc'ing the CKAN4RDM list this time!]

I've been in touch with Joss Winn and he isn't planning to attend the
conference, while it would be good to incorporate CKAN into the workshop to
demonstrate some potential uses, that doesn't need to be theme and was just
an initial suggestion. I mentioned to the Open Repositories team that we
have several working group members interested in search/indexing/mining as
well and said I would ask for suggestions.

People seem to be pointing towards:
1) Automatic/crowdsourced deposition of OA work into repositories via
OAButton system or other means (maybe we could persuade a few live
repositories to implement the deposit button Mark discussed).
2) Indexing content for search and discovery.
3) Bridging between where people publish code and data (e.g.
GitHub/BitBucket) and then how that's incorporated and referenced in the
literature (thanks Arfon for this suggestion!) How do repositories fit in?

I copy in Imma who is from the Open Repositories organising committee to
see if she has any feedback on the ideas so far and we can decide which one
might best make for a coherent workshop. From last year's programme these
are typically 3-4 hours. This document should also give a feel for the
kinds of sessions that were being run

Hi All

Apologies for not following this up for a while. If anyone else is
interested in getting involved and wants to sign up, please do at
http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition

*So far :*

Michelle and Juan have offered to coordinate and Ross and Abby are keen to
take so I think we have enough people to go ahead!

Bjoern - I think at this stage a data expedition would be more finding out
what data we can get and then we can bring the economists on board so if
you would still be happy to help coordinate that would be fantastic!

It may end up being a somewhat futile exercise as we're dealing with
corporations and not public bodies so getting hold of account breakdowns
will be challenging.

As was pointed out to me the other day and I hadn't explicitly mentioned,
scholarly publishing is only a part of the activities of many of the major
publishers so splitting apart profit for journals, academic books and
monographs (let alone teasing those items apart) may simply be impossible
if the companies themselves won't supply us with the data. It would be
informative to see what is out there though and start compiling what we do
know.

*Next steps: *

   - If you would like to help in any capacity please sign up on the pad
   http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition as soon as
   convenient.
   - Coordinators can then introduce themselves to each other in the next
   week or so and get an initial call arranged or at least split off the
   mailing list for in-depth discussion about how to proceed and what we
   should aim to accomplish.
   - Updates will be sent to the main mailing list so don't worry if you
   can't sign up right now but think you might be able to assist in the future.

We can review the sign ups in a week and get started with some more
detailed planning! This idea is still very much open to comments and
criticism and again, if you know any friendly economists or data
journalists who might be keen to get on board do point them in our
direction!

I got this from OpenForum. It's very important that OKFN has a strong input
to this.

Dear all,

This just released
http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/consultations/2013/copyright-rules/index_en.htm
Very nice of the Commission to hold such an important consultation during
the holiday season...
Can we get an idea on who plans to provide input and if there are areas
where it would make sense to discuss/coordinate responses? (e.g. on text
and data mining)

Best regards,

Mael

?? Why does it have to be a local institutional repo? This religious
insistence on Universities at the centre has held us back. I use to work
for Glaxo - where do I put my papers? Where do Cottagelabbers put them? The
fewer outlets (> 1 but small) the better. Options include:

* arXiv
* EuropePMC
* CKAN
* Wikipedia

and perhaps national libraries.

>>Also I'm not sure how much metadata they hold about the articles people
report using the OAButton. An integration between the OAButton data and
CrossRef has more chance here, and is a cool idea. There's not enough
integration between OAButton and repos yet, though we do use CORE to look
stuff up automatically for our users.

Why should we base the future on a system that clearly isn't (yet) working.
Given the choice of going to Wikipedia and
theUniversityOfNowhereIHaveHeardOf where would people want to go?

Is it? Can I search for (say) "Blackbird" or "Turdus Merula"? I don't get
any results. We need to build our own.

Yes.

Excellent.

this is probably the "ultimate" topic of such a workshop, I don't think

other 2 examples above + other existing projects come together to a greater
whole worthy of a workshop though.

There is no technical reason why not, and I think the need is becoming
clearer. Figshare showed that one graduate student can change the world,
OAButton showed that undergraduates will. Wikipedia has built a better
knowledge engine than almost any university. We have all the indexing tools
built (we can add Pubcrawler to the Cottagelab tools) and the problem can
be scaled with committed humans.

If we built this, do you think there is any possibility of getting traction
with people to say things like:

1. "If you want to find scholarly material, THIS is where to look"

2. "If you want to deposit scholarly material, THIS is where you do it"

Whilst relying on universities or similar community structures may be the
way of the past, it is still where most people are - and most people care
only about accessing what they need; thus point 1 is easier, but point 2
will be polluted by the local community an individual is part of.

How do we overcome that localised impetus to "do it some other way"?

If enough people believe we can overcome this and are willing to be
involved in doing so, then I am willing to build and maintain the thing
(and others, of course, would help me).

This would be something to discuss at OR14 - a new global archive of all
available scholarly content (pre-populated with everything we can find and
regularly crawl for in all other archives), and an initiative to get people
to start using it across the world.

Wikipedia works because there's one of it.

eBay works for the same reason.

More pertinently, that's why arXiv works, too.

The whole system of IRs necessarily and *by design* leads to
balkanisation. How could it not? That's what the institutions actively
*want* -- come and see *our* awesome repo! What researchers need is
for there to be one repo in the world. (Plus any number of mirrors, of
course.)

Or HOW you do it.

Q2 is mainly predicated on scholars and their organisations. Q1 reaches out
to the whole world.

Wikipedia addresses Q1. It addresses Q2 on the basis that the information
can be found. Neitehr of those currently resides in Universities to a
significant amount.

Thanks!! That is my commitment as well. It's not the first time we have
rasied this, but the first is not always the one that survives.

Yes. The idea was strong at BeyondThePDF2. It's an idea whose time has
arrived (I think).

And we can do it in stages - starting with high-quality, valuable, Open
material.

In principle I agree. But none of these was by global design. Wikipedia
overtook other free encyclopedias. So I think we have to accept there will
be a small number of "competing" approaches (<= 3). Then  the best and most
usable solutions will emerge. We cannot *design* the best final solution.
We can build it and work to making it the fittest.

The whole system of IRs necessarily and *by design* leads to

Totally agreed. IRs have destroyed any sense of community solution. In fact
any solution of anything based on universities will balkanize. That is why
the excitement happens outside.

Yes. I'd be happy for one national repository per country because nations,
unlike universities have an interest and experience in building good
information systems. If done well it then becomes  a feasible task to unite
or overlay them, because the nations will *want* them to be used.

The alternatives are:
* rapid uncontrolled evolution of bottom-up tools. This may work (e.g.
Figshare) as long as it's Open.
* large benign institutions such as Mozilla, Wikipedia or OKFN taking a
lead.
* monopolist capitalists (e.g. Mendeley). I'm not keen on this one.

There is no technical reason.

arXiv is a preprint server though I gather that many authors later submit
their final corrected version of record.

Many chemistry publishers forbid preprints. Chemist would swallow prussic
acid rather than put their work in a preprint server. There are groups in
the same laboratory who only know what the neigbouring lab is doing by
reading the literature. Imperial College chemists demanded that all theses
are embargoed for at least 5 years - because there is a danger that someone
might read them.

I believe in discipline repositories where the community approves -
bioscience  and astronomy are good on this. Putting science in an IR
destroys it - you have to have a practising expert associated with the
repo. arXiv has that.

None of us know how to build the whole thing. Some of us things we know how
to start. We want other people to become involved and change those ideas,
improve them, implement them. No, lecturing at people isn't really
appropriate.

They didn't. There are still people in positions where they would not be
allowed to refer to content in arxiv, even though what is there may be the
most recent and comprehensive content.

Strangely, and in relation to Peters earlier comment that there are plenty
of people beyond the institutional bounds I mentioned (which is of course
true), it is the people within institutional bounds that are most
constrained by these issues.

I think it must come down to - as all successful services do - convenience.
Make it so easy and so much better than any alternative that people every
where want to use it, then they will change their communities to suit.

But again, the hard part in addition to making the thing easy is in letting
everybody know at least that it exists, so that they can try it and realise
it is better.

There are plenty of good people in libraries and other places that would
recommend such a great service over the "usual ways to do it", but there
must be some sort of comms-y / marketing / advertising-y stuff we do not
know about but probably must engage in.

Ok, I'm not sure I'll be able to help much. I
could list what kinds of data would be helpful.

For instance, stuff like this from Heather:

Spot on! And neither Ebay, nor Wikipedia are a
single computer with one harddrive. The advantage
of the net is that it doesn't matter where things
are, as long as it appears unitary for the human
user. Which is why, practically, repositories are
great: there are people, funds and institutions
attached to it in many ways, such that each
repository and its contents are 'cared for' in a
very decentralized way. That's the good part.

The bad part is that they operate in a balkanized'
way, which means nobody is using them.

It seems to me that the most feasible way (both
legally and practically) is to get repositories to
act as peers in a single peer-2-peer network
(perhaps using a torrent-like technology), where
the peers care for, maintain and curate the
content, rather than to design a centralized
intitiative from scratch.

I'll let myself be convinced otherwise, but for now
repositories appear to me like arms, legs, livers
and spleens looking for a brain to make it all
work. Designing a whole human from scratch appears
to bring a whole bag of issues with it that might
hamper any such approach beyond what it's worth.

What are the arguments against redesigning
repositories and for designing a new scholarly
knowledge database from scratch?

Again, we obviously need "here is your scholarly
content:", but are there any good reasons why that
content cannot/should not be located in current
repositories adhering to a common standard?

TCP/IP, http and HTML all originated at
institutions. They did not balkanize. Why should
analogous standards necessarily balkanize?

Existing repos adhering to standards would be fine, so long as no
political barriers were erected to people doing the kinds of things
that need doing: systematic downloading, mirroring, reindexing,
exporting, importing, peer-to-peer connections and so on.
Unfortunately sense is that a lot of IRs very explicitly don't want
people to do ANY of that. They want the world to come to their one
special magic web-site and read the papers only there. Which is not
that much more advanced than the position of paywalled publishers.

The real issues here are much more social than technical. As usual.

Precisely! This is THE ONE key point!
And the functionality of what we have is so
abysmal, that it doesn't take a whole lot to be the
best in the world.

It may not be easy, but never has it been easier
to "spread the word" than in times of social media.

People are so, so fed up with the way our
infrastructure works - anything that makes them
spend less time wrestling with it and more time
with its content will spread like wildfire - no PR
required at all. I promise.

Perhaps I'm really hopelessly naive, but this

There is no debating that, I guess :-) Which is
why visions are important: visions get people
motivated to be a part in realizing them.
I believe the vision of getting everything in one place,
filtered, sorted and immensely relevant is
powerful!

Well, sure! I'm not criticising the vision; I'm criticising how far
short of that vision the world we live in currently falls!

You may find it irrational that an institution wants its faculty's
papers openly available only from their IR and nowhere else. People
whose job it is to count beans will disagree. Needless to say, I'm on
your side, but there's no point in pretending the bean-counters don't
exist.

For nearly ten years I have tried to promote the idea of indexing or
repositories and got nowhere. I wish it were different. As examples:

* I ran a funded JISC (UK) project on Open Bibliography.I offered to
explore the indexing of theses (unlike NL it is impossible to find online
theses in UK other than manually trawling through 200 repos). I presented
to the ETHOS project but their priority was to digitize the past.They told
me I would have to seek permission from every individual author.

* I wrote to Bernard Rentier offering to come to Liege and investigate
indexing the ORBI repository on a scientific basis. His repsonse was that
they were taking a staged approach and that [paraphrasing] I should wait a
few years.

* After a tweet I thought that LSE was intested and blogged a proposal to
index it. They weren't actually interested.

* I wrote several times to the Cambridge Librarian about text-mining. She
never acknowledged my mails.

More generally:

* repo owners are no interested in anyone outside their library doing
anything with their content. They have a ?10-year (or longer) plan to
federate them

* some repo owners (including Liege) deliberately choose CC-NC and refuse
to change.

So personally I have become disillusions with conventional repos. The UK
REF makes it worse as the sole purpose of many repos seems to be to
accumulate the content on which the university is formally judged.This does
not have to be Open. The mentality is not a service positively exposing
content to the world but a bureaucratic management process.

It may be different in other countries...


No - trying to index even one UK

Hmm... if the OAButton showed you your own research (e.g. just by name),
showed you how many people hit a paywall trying to get your article(s) and
prompted you to deposit, that seems like a good way of convincing more
people to do it. Would it not be insanely complex in terms of finding WHERE
to deposit to though? (I.e. has to be a local institutional repo because UK
is not Norway, correct me if I'm wrong.)

Also I'm not sure how much metadata they hold about the articles people
report using the OAButton. An integration between the OAButton data and
CrossRef has more chance here, and is a cool idea. There's not enough
integration between OAButton and repos yet, though we do use CORE to look
stuff up automatically for our users. Not enough for a workshop on its own
unless more development happens in this area, but could be included.

I think Jorum, the open educational resource system, is built on DSpace,
and that's doing fine with its catalogue: http://find.jorum.ac.uk/
But I guess what the audience will really want to hear about is basically
an open alternative to Google Scholar.

One thing which can attach information to very large amounts of DOI-s is
http://oag.cottagelabs.com/ , a mass license checker - goes directly to
publisher websites and scrapes them (or uses API-s where available). So
this is not precisely discovery just yet, but it does fill the legal gap
(the license of the items we index for discovery and search).

Many have tried to build an open index of scholarship (I've tried with
others too, still trying) but I haven't heard of a big one just yet. While
this is probably the "ultimate" topic of such a workshop, I don't think
we're at the stage where you can base a workshop on that idea. Maybe the
other 2 examples above + other existing projects come together to a greater
whole worthy of a workshop though.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Sorry Peter, I didn't mean "that's the only option", it's just the first
thing everybody tries to do. I definitely go to CORE and in general
aggregating information from individual repositories when a piece of
software needs to be able to find papers. I quite agree that a centralised
e.g. Norway's approach is superior in many ways. That's quite the paradigm
shift though. We need to identify ways of making people believe this is
possible and see the benefits + address concerns they have.

Right, fair enough.

Dumb question: why can't arXiv handle content from all disciplines?
(Manpower? Technical debt? All of it probably boils down to willingness and
money, but if we can identify problems with existing
centralised-but-not-comprehensive-enough systems, we can do something about
it.)

But Wikipedia covers everything, or at least doesn't exclude based on
discipline. Is there a system that can take all of UK's research metadata?
CKAN and elasticsearch and friends don't count until they're deployed with
a wrapper that allows depositing in multiple ways and covered server bills.

You mention Wikipedia, and it does fulfil those criteria. But how can we
deposit research metadata on wikipedia (or more broadly, how to use it to
describe research)? You could run a wiki which stores all the full text of
all the OA articles or the PDF file where that's unavailable. But this is
still a piece of software, not a system. If we're not talking about wiki
software, but Wikipedia.org, I'm not sure how research metadata (or the
text of all the OA research) would fit into it.

Hm, my notion of a workshop was more towards the "people come to hear how
to do this or about work in progress on this", but it's actually a lot more
of a discussion / contribution thing. I guess you can run them both ways,
more towards the lecture side of the spectrum and more towards the hacking
side. So yes, "Building the Green cake and decorating it" or a subset of
that is a viable topic then.

So how did arxiv do it? Can they take on more or can we replicate it
(without duplicating their efforts obviously). Note they're still hosted by
a single institution, yet archive the content of whole disciplines (or
close to it). So even the potential politics that you'd think would break
such a project obviously didn't.

Right, well http://cottagelabs.com/news/an-academic-catalogue . But as in
summer 2012, the issue is time, who has the availability to commit properly
to this kind of project / this project, bring it to MVP, get some users (so
you can't give up) and keep at it?
It's not even like we tried that hard to get help with it (money and
people), just because we had to build other things. And obviously we're
still working on it, but it feels like the kind of thing that should have
been available years ago. I want to be using it! (I don't mind building it,
but not having it is frustrating.)

Every. single. discussion. that a research-related project like OAButton
and OAG has ends up in "we want a queryable index of all the research with
licensing info and an API and a data dump, so not Google Scholar .. uh ok
let's use CORE but we want a better one".

For the record, let me defend the ?French? model (since there seems to be a Liege one):
- central repository to minimise costs and improve visibility (you?ve all hear of HAL, can you name the on at the University of Stirling?)
- freedom for institution to define their deposit policy (but I am proud of the Inria mandate)
- availability of all content for data mining (OK, you?ll see no CC on the current version, but the new (codename V3) version should go CC-BY (of course; I just wonder why one would ask?)
OK. Peter, our PhD repository (tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/?) is full of boring stuff in French, but if you?re interested, do index!

To answer the current argument on repositories. The most important thing for me is to ensure that we have a public and sustainable research infrastructure (all words are important). I now see colleagues rushing to ResearchGate or Acdemia just because they receive nice messages tickling their ego and they don?t even notice that their online papers in HAL are downloaded 50 times more. OK, it?s maybe our fault that we do not provide adequate statistics and that we do not consider researchers? ego enough.

Cheers,
Laurent

Salut Laurent,

You touch upon a very serious point. You should indeed consider researchers' egos more, as you sort of admit. After all, the issue is not so much technological (in spite of appearances) as it is psycho-sociological. Egos are important in what is, in many respects, the academic 'ego-system'. The system hangs together with recognition, credits, acknowledgement and the like. The highest barriers and strongest impediments are not technical. Where they are, they can be remedied comparatively easily. The (sub)cultural barriers don't get enough attention, I think (maybe I don't move in the right circles), and those are the most important to break down. We need more psychologists in the discussion to drive it forwards, perhaps.

Bon ouiquainde!

Best,

Jan

It doesn't. I just think the 'cultural' issues are underrepresented in any discussions. One such issue is central vs. institutional repositories. That's a choice, hardly a technical issue.

Of course not. The 'thing being available' is a conditio sine qua non. But as Laurent said, "we do not provide adequate statistics and we do not consider researchers; ego enough."

> On the contrary, it means more people will see it, more will use it, and more will give credit. Take the opposite: make it available only in a closed-access journal and no PDF anywhere .. and others will still be able to plagiarise or not cite + even less people will actually see / cite the article. Maybe I need to talk to somebody with more nuanced understanding of this bit, since I hope this is not the ol' piracy argument all over, but with recognition substituted for money.

No, it isn't at all. But the cause of open access, which I fully espouse, would benefit from understanding the deeper psycho-sociological issues and (lack of) motives why such a large number of researchers still stick by the traditional system and do not deposit willingly, so that 'mandates' are needed. Just calling researchers ignorant, or even stupid, as is done by some, simply doesn't wash. Those psycho-sociological ? cultural, if you wish ? elements make me think that for readers as well as authors a central, easily accessible, e.g. national, or even global, repository with standardised and easy deposit and access procedures and rules (e.g. TDM-able) is best for everyone. That's I think what Laurent has in mind as well. He will correct me if I'm wrong. If deposit and finding/access of content in repositories is easy and convenient, authors are more likely to see its attractions. One attracts butterflies with honey, not with vinegar.

The (sub)cultural barriers don't get enough attention, I think (maybe I don't move in the right circles), and those are the most important to break down. We need more psychologists in the discussion to drive it forwards, perhaps.

Wikipedia won't like a mass upload of academic papers but there is
discussion to use Wikimedia Commons and/ or Wikisource this way,
though it's not yet clear what to do with supplementary files in
formats not allowed on those platforms (e.g. doc and xls).

Because some librarians (certainly in UK) see it as part of their job to
emphasize what you can't do... Many deliberately (e.g. Bath) add CC-NC

OK. Peter, our PhD repository (tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/) is full of

My program AMI does not understand the word "boring". She has the emotional
apparatus of a FORTRAN compiler so she will have a look. At present we
index on Species and they should be the same, so this is a great opportunity

Agreed. But that has to include  people like the current members of the

Firstly people outside the inward-looking repo circle need to be made
welcome. That's not just me, it's Mike Taylor, it's the OAButton
undergraduate students, it's Kitware, it's the #scholarlypoor. It's
Wikipedia and Mozilla. Repositories should be actively seeking the outside
world.

Secondly there has to be investment of effort in getting people using this
in a modern way. Maybe this happens for HAL, but it certainly doesn't in
UK. Maybe I can help make it happen. Who knows?

hi Daniel,

I argue that transitioning scholarly works to Wikimedia tools on a blanket basis is premature. Before this can happen, many questions need to be resolved. For example, is Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons etc. prepared to accept the full range of licensing options and to accommodate the kind of attribution required by scholars?

To state the obvious, Wikipedia's tradition of anonymity of authors is not compatible with the scholarly tradition of anonymity.The same is true of Wikipedia-style derivatives: anonymous editing by whoever is a very different tradition from the scholarly norms of citation.   Is Wikipedia planning to change its policy to accommodate scholarly authors?

Has anyone done research asking what scholars think of others taking their work and submitting it to Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, etc., without asking further permission? I'm pretty sure that not even authors who deliberately use CC-BY licenses have really thought through what people might do with their works and whether they think this is okay or not. For example, it is only because I am a former Wikipedia editor that I can state with confidence that I consider it a poor use of my time to write works that can be readily changed by anyone else.

Didn't PLoS have an experiment with one of their journals involving automatic deposit of articles in Wikipedia? How is that going?

best,

Why should we base the future on a system that clearly isn't (yet) working.
Given the choice of going to Wikipedia and

Wikipedia won't like a mass upload of academic papers but there is

I agree, that's why any attempts in this direction have carefully
selected their targets: my bot, for instance, only targets audio and
video files under CC BY or CC0 that are available from PubMed Central.

I don't see any prospect of any Wikimedia project allowing licenses
that restrict reuse beyond CC BY-SA. Nor any reason why they should.

So what? You certainly can use your real name in both traditions.

So what? Scholarly norms have yet to come to grips with versioned
documents but I think that closer inspection and practical experience
tends to shift the balance in favour of public version histories. And
while the large corpus of information available from Wikipedia
certainly includes plagiarism, my experience is that copyright issues
are being dealt with rather professionally in most cases, once they
have been identified.

The policies are evolving too, but not currently in the ways you outline above.

Few academics care about (and are aware of the implications of) the
agreements they sign on licensing or copyright transfer. But maybe
they will start thinking about that if they see their name on a list
of papers reported via the OA button or a video from one of their
papers embedded in a Wikipedia.

Many will share your opinion. But I think it is possible to configure
Wiki(p/m)edia engagement in a way that it is useful to the
contributors, even if they are scholars.

Slowly but steadily forward. The current state is at

Scholarship and wikipedia - evidence to date?

Thanks Daniel for pointing to the latest on the PLoS Computational Biology / Wikipedia pilot.

Here is the summary of progress to date from the PLoS 2012/13 Progress Update:

PLOS Computational Biology advanced its project to boost Wikipedia?s content with the publication of four new topic pages<http://blogs.plos.org/plos/2013/03/to-wikipedia-and-beyond-topic-pages-from-plos-computational-biology-4/>, written in the style of a Wikipedia article. Topic pages represent a new level of interaction between publishers, researchers and the public. The review process is open, with readers and authors able to see the review history and reviewer identities. Once finalized, a version of record is published in PLOS Computational Biology and included as part of the Education collection<http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browse/issue/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pcol.v03.i02>. The text is uploaded to Wikipedia, where it may be further updated and enhanced by the Wikipedia community. The initiative, which was proposed and is run by the scientific community, has received positive feedback.
http://www.plos.org/about/what-is-plos/progress-updates/

If a willing scholarly community with an interest in this experiment has only come up with 4 wikipedia pages, it is quite a stretch to extrapolate from this a wide-spread desire by the scholarly community at large to move our works to Wikipedia. If anything, this indicates a limited interest and suggests that those who experimented in this area are seeing reasons to move slowly and cautiously. It would helpful if those involved would share their experiences - to supplement the limited quantitative data (4 topic pages) with further quantitative data (e.g. what percentage of authors / articles were involved in the pilot) and qualitative data (i.e. what has been learned to date). Perhaps this would make a good PLoS ONE article - a good illustration of how we can learn even without a stellar success to show off?

Here is the PLoS site Daniel points to:

That's a very general question, so here are some general pointers:

.

With respect to the subject of this thread, it may indeed be
interesting to discuss Wikimedia platforms as repositories of
scholarly materials, or their interaction with more classical
repositories.

As far as I can see, you are the first to make that extrapolation.

However, if scholars publish their research under a
Wikimedia-compatible license, that allows anyone (scholar or not) to
move those articles (or, more commonly, parts thereof, especially
images and multimedia) to Wikimedia platforms, as long as the
communities there accept that. It seems they do - currently, there are
over 20k files from OA sources on Wikimedia Commons, of which 6k are
used a total of 66k times across 300 other Wikimedia projects (cf.
http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/glamorous.php?doit=1&category=Open+access+%28publishing%29&use_globalusage=1&ns0=1&depth=5&projects[wikipedia]=1&projects[wikimedia]=1&projects[wikisource]=1&projects[wikibooks]=1&projects[wikiquote]=1&projects[wiktionary]=1&projects[wikinews]=1&projects[wikivoyage]=1&projects[wikispecies]=1&projects[mediawiki]=1&projects[wikidata]=1&projects[wikiversity]=1
),
and together, those 66k pages get over a million page views per day
(except on Saturdays; cf.
http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/baglama.php?group=Open+access+%28publishing%29&date=201310
), which means considerable exposure for the underlying research
topics. Naturally, works not published under Wikimedia-compatible
licenses are not affected.

Besides, PLOS Computational Biology rarely publishes review articles,
and apart from RNA Biology (which has a manuscript track that also
generates Wikipedia articles, but separate from the manuscripts), it
currently is the only scholarly journal to publish articles destined
for any Wikipedia, which means we are on new ground here, where
explosive growth is not to be expected.

So far we have

1/ basic infrastructure with metadata, original files and indexed full text
2/ (the right) usage stats

http://Altrmetric.com and http://Impactstory.org strike me as nice bits of
kits which already do all the "look your article was downloaded > 100
times" stuff, so #1 could be an additional data source for these services.
Obviously they could go away at any point, but that's hardly a concern
right now considering we haven't managed #1 in the UK yet.

Another thing...

This seems incontrovertibly true. But why does that work against a
centralised system of access / easier access in other forms though?

The thing being available doesn't mean people won't give credit. On the
contrary, it means more people will see it, more will use it, and more will
give credit. Take the opposite: make it available only in a closed-access
journal and no PDF anywhere .. and others will still be able to plagiarise
or not cite + even less people will actually see / cite the article. Maybe
I need to talk to somebody with more nuanced understanding of this bit,
since I hope this is not the ol' piracy argument all over, but with
recognition substituted for money.

As Jan wrote: It doesn't - but understanding the socio-economic factors creating the demands on the infrastructure is crucial for getting it right. 

1) Recognition, statistics, etc. is one crucial point for an industry that is built upon reputation and usually composed of number-fetishists :-) (BTW, which is why statistics of the OAButton need to be made public: people will hate it if people want to read their paper but can't)
2) Time is of the essence: researchers do not have enough time to do the work they like, because they waste too much time on work they hate. Thus, they will flock to things that save them time.

Create something that strokes our ego and simultaneously saves us time and we will follow you like a dog the sausage.

Hi,

The forced retraction of the S?ralini paper from an Elsevier journal (an attack in itself on the integrity of the scientific publication process and a clear sign that the Pre publication review process is really agonizing) makes me wonder what happens to a paper that has been retracted from a journal, but that had been deposited in a repository. Should it be also "retracted" from the repository? By whom? On whose authority? Did it happen already?

	Reform

Message-ID: <C92BA0FE-5B27-4D29-A7C1-CF0C7979ECFE@gmail.com>

Perhaps the discussion on a wider set of reform issues of scholarly publishing than just 'green' OA is better discussed on this list than the GOAL one. May I start off (if it hasn't already been done) with a discussion on publisher-mediated pre-publication peer review? I'll do that in the form of reproducing a blog post I wrote a little while ago, entitled "Essence of academic publishing" (original here: http://theparachute.blogspot.co.uk/2013/11/essence-of-academic-publishing.html).

??????
Let me start with a bit of context, all of which will be known, understood and widely discussed. The blame of unaffordability of the ever-increasing amount of scholarly literature, be it because of high subscription prices or article processing fees for ?gold? open access, is often laid at the door of the publishers.

Of course, publishers, subscription-based ones as well as open access outfits, have a business which depends to a very large degree on being the organisers of PPR and few of them would like to see the imperative disappear. The ?need? ? real or perceived ? for publisher-mediated PPR in the academic ecosystem is the main raison d??tre of most publishers. And it is responsible for most of their costs (personnel costs), even though it is actually carried out by academics and not publishers. The technical costs of publishing are but a fraction of that, at least the cost of electronic publishing (print and its distribution are quite expensive, but to be seen as an optional service and not as part of the essence of academic publishing).

Despite it being the imperative in Academia, publisher-mediated PPR has flaws, to say the least. Among causes for deep concern are its anonymity and general lack of transparency, highly variable quality, and the unrealistic expectations of what peer review can possibly deliver in the first place. The increasing amount of journal articles being submitted is making the process of finding appropriate reviewers not easier, either.

Originally, PPR was a perfectly rational approach to ensuring that scarce resources were not spent on the expensive business of printing and distributing paper copies of articles that were indeed not deemed to be worth that expense. Unfortunately, the rather subjective judgment needed for that approach led to unwelcome side effects, such as negative results not being published. In the era of electronic communication, with its very low marginal costs of dissemination, prepublication filtering seems anachronistic. Of course, initial technical costs of publishing each article remain, but the amounts involved are but a fraction of the costs per article of the traditional print-based system, and an even smaller fraction of the average revenues per article many publishers make.

Now, with the publishers? argument of avoiding excessive costs of publishing largely gone, PPR is often presented as some sort of quality filter, protecting readers against unintentionally spending their valuable time and effort on unworthy literature. Researchers must be a na?ve lot, given the protection they seem to need. The upshot of PPR seems to be that anything that is peer reviewed before publication, and does get through the gates, is to be regarded as proper, worthwhile, and relevant material. But is it? Can it be taken as read that everything in peer-reviewed publications is beyond doubt? Should a researcher be reassured by the fact that it has passed a number of filters that purport to keep scientific ?rubbish? out?

Of course they should. These filtering mechanisms are there for a reason. They diminish the need for critical thinking. Researchers should just believe what they read in ?approved? literature. They shouldn?t just question everything.

Or are these the wrong answers?

Isn?t it time that academics who are relying on PPR ?quality? filters ? and let us hope it?s a minority of them ? should stop believing at face value what is being presented in the ?properly peer-reviewed and approved? literature, and go back to the critical stance that is the hallmark of a true scientist: ?why should I believe these results or these assertions?? The fact that an article is peer-reviewed in no way absolves researchers of applying professional skepticism to whatever they are reading. Further review, post-publication, remains necessary. It?s part of the fundamentals of the scientific method.

So, what about this: a system in which authors discuss, in-depth and critically, their manuscripts with a few people who they can identify and accept as their peers. And then ask those people to put their name to the manuscript as ?endorsers?. As long as some reasonable safeguards are in place that endorsers are genuine, serious and without undeclared conflicts of interest (e.g. they shouldn?t be recent colleagues at the same institution as the author, or be involved in the same collaborative project, or have been a co-author in, say, the last five years), the value of this kind of peer-review ? author-mediated PPR, if you wish ? is unlikely to be any less than publisher-mediated PPR. In fact, it?s likely to offer more value, if only due to transparency and to the expected reduction in the cost of publishing. It doesn?t mean, of course, that the peer-endorsers should agree with all of the content of the articles they endorse. They merely endorse itspublication. Steve Pettifer of the University of Manchester once presented a perfect example of this. He showed a quote from Alan Singleton about a peer reviewer?s report[1]:

"This is a remarkable result ? in fact, I don?t believe it. However, I have examined the paper and can find no fault in the author?s methods and results. Thus I believe it should be published so that others may assess it and the conclusions and/or repeat the experiment to see whether the same results are achieved."

An author-mediated PPR-ed manuscript could subsequently be properly published, i.e. put in a few robust, preservation-proof formats, properly encoded with Unicode characters, uniquely identified and identifiable, time-stamped, citable in any reference format, suitable for human- and machine-reading, data extraction, reuse, deposit in open repositories, printing, and everything else that one might expect of a professionally produced publication, including a facility for post-publication commenting and review. That will cost, of course, but it will be a fraction of the current costs of publication, be they paid for via subscriptions, article processing charges, or subsidies. Good for the affordability of open access publishing for minimally funded authors, e.g. in the social sciences and humanities, and for the publication of null results that, though very useful, hardly get a chance in the current system.

Comments welcome.

We should get rid of pre-publication peer review (PPPR) and publish results in open repositories. PPPR is the one thing that keeps the whole publishing system standing, and expensive ? in monetary terms, but also in terms of effort expended. It may have some benefits, but we pay very dearly for those. Where are the non-peer-reviewed articles that have caused damage? They may have to public understanding, of course (there's a lot of rubbish on the internet), but to scientific understanding? On the other hand, I can point to peer-reviewed articles that clearly have done damage, particularly to public understanding. Take the Wakefield MMR paper. Had it just been published without peer-review, the damage would likely have been no greater than that of any other drivel on the internet. Its peer-reviewed status, however, gave it far more credibility than it deserved. There are more examples.

I still think Jeff Beall is doing something useful with his naming and shaming of junk OA journals, but I now realize that he is driven by some sort of fanciful conspiracy theory! "OA is all an anti-capitlist plot." (Even on a quick skim it is evident that Jeff's article is rife with half-truths, errors and downright nonsense. Pity. It will diminish the credibility of his valid expos?s, but maybe this is a good thing, if the judgment and motivation behind Beall's list is as kooky as this article!

The OA movement is an anti-corporatist movement that wants to deny the freedom of the press to companies it disagrees with. The movement is also actively imposing onerous mandates on researchers, mandates that restrict individual freedom. To boost the open-access movement, its leaders sacrifice the academic futures of young scholars and those from developing countries, pressuring them to publish in lower-quality open-access journals.  The open-access movement has fostered the creation of numerous predatory publishers and standalone journals, increasing the amount of research misconduct in scholarly publications and the amount of pseudo-science that is published as if it were authentic science."

By instituting a policy of exchanging funds between researchers and publishers, the movement has fostered corruption on a grand scale.

Subject: [Open-access] Risks in using an Addendum
Message-ID: <CAMW92=kZc3yewWrkQCv+BTDJFDnckwKraZXrg9ju045=wTmAdg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Colleagues,

I suspect the following question may seem frustrating, but it may become an
important talking point in our Open Access advocacy work at Boston
University.

We are advocating for an opt-out OA policy, as described
here<http://buoa.blogspot.com>.
A practical question has come up, and I am trying to improve our response
to it. I think that if we had a stronger response to this question, it
might ease the bureaucratic process greatly.

Question:

Consider a young Assistant Professor, "Professor Priya," who just got an
article accepted by a prestigious toll-access journal. She receives the
publishing contract in an email, and it restricts Green Open Access rather
strictly.

Earnestly complying with her university's new opt-out policy, Priya signs
the contract with an Author's
Addendum<http://www.bu.edu/dioa/authors/author-addendum/>,
and sends it in.

Should Priya be concerned about including this addendum? *Is there a risk
that her inclusion of the addendum will delay the article's publication, or
even cause the journal's acceptance of the article to be canceled?* Or, can
she rest assured that the publisher will reply back in a timely fashion,
allowing her to get the article published.

She is willing to agree to a reasonable embargo period, and even to opt-out
of some of the authors' rights reserved under the opt-out policy. But she
doesn't want to miss this opportunity to get this article published. The
tenure-track review board is meeting next month!


My institutional librarians have assured me that "Professor Priya" has
nothing to worry about. However, I am left with few advocacy tools other
than their anecdotal assurances. I would love to remove this nebulous worry
from the pro/con balance of an opt-out policy here at BU.

What kind of harder evidence could help assure the faculty that the
addendum will certainly not affect Priya's already-accepted article being
published in a timely fashion? A survey of institutional librarians? A
survey of publishers? A survey of journal editors?

Thanks much for your time and consideration of this query.

Sincerely,
-Steven Bhardwaj

I can only offer more anecdotal evidence: I've never heard even a
rumour of a journal either cancelling or delaying publication due to
an author's use of an addendum. AT WORST they will just refuse to
accept the addendum.

Meanwhile, I recommend a simpler solution: just place your manuscript
in the public domain. This will put it on the same footing as works
produced by the US Federal Government, e.g. palaeontologists working
for the Bureau of Land Management. Then when the journal asks for
copyright transfer, you can simply and honestly reply that there is no
copyright to transfer, but that give enthusiastic permission to
publish.

-- Mike.

Great to hear! Perhaps anecdotes like yours are all I need for hard
evidence, if there are enough of them. Maybe I should draft an open letter
that expresses what you are saying, and get it signed by a number of
academics, deans, provosts, and the like, at institutions where many papers
are published with addenda.

Would an open letter would be a good method? Has it already been done, or
is there a better way?

That's certainly innovative and exciting, a daredevil way to publish a work
open-access... I like it! I reviewed an interesting thread on the topic here
on svpow<http://svpow.com/2012/12/13/what-would-happen-if-i-placed-my-manuscripts-in-the-public-domain/>
that
you participated in. However, I worry that faculty leadership at my
institution are somewhat loss-averse regarding their junior faculty's
publications. The query I am reporting comes from comments made by one of
our Associate Provosts. I expect that none could accuse her of playing fast
and loose with the university's academic ranking.

I would advise talking to Stuart Shieber at Harvard who is the architect of their policy and will have experience of exactly which publishers do what and under what circumstances. I would also say that if you align your policy with Harvard's then you've and you have information from them on what agreements they have in place with publishers that you can use that as leverage.

However, I worry that faculty leadership at my institution are somewhat loss-averse regarding their junior faculty's publications. The query I am reporting comes from comments made by one of our Associate Provosts. I expect that none could accuse her of playing fast and loose with the university's academic ranking.

This is a great and much-needed discussion of the ways in which IRs need to
grow (or evolve) in order to provide both depositors/authors and readers
with the functionalities they desire.

FWIW, a number of institutions in the US (including ours) are moving away
from DSpace towards Hydra, which will give the freedom of development so
that we can build the functionalities mentioned above. Everyone agrees that
the silos we've created for each institution are outdated. We're trying to
crack the nut of building repos that primarily serve authors that don't
have centralized subject repos like Dryad to deposit their scholarship,
while also allowing for greater collaboration across institutions.

One q I have for this list is what specific tasks would a researcher who
wishes to harvest IR content via API need to be able to do? Our internal
discussions about desired new IR functions don't include an API for
researchers--but that doesn't mean it _couldn't_ include such an API.
Feedback from the list would be appreciated and could inform future
development.

Also, a few points:

- In the US, there's also been a movement towards creating a searchable
federation of IRs called SHARE [1], which originally was designed to
compete with the CHORUS proposal. HOWEVER, from what I've heard, even if
SHARE dies as a CHORUS competitor, many still recognize the value inherent
in having a nationally federated IR system and the project would likely
move forward in any event. SHARE would need to ensure that its content
could be easily searched and indexed by a variety of systems beyond Google
Scholar and OAIster [2], which has sub-par search capabilities.

- I agree with both Jan that usability has been a major socio-technical
barrier for researchers to adopt the practice of making their work OA in
any repository. We (IR admins and developers) need to fix this major
problem before we can offer IRs as a solution to any problem of access or
preservation, and we DEFINITELY need to make sure our IRs are usable before
we encourage faculty to work towards enacting OA mandates.

- A reminder about why we need an open alternative to Google Scholar:

From: dougie.carnall at gmail.com (Douglas Carnall)
Date: Fri, 13 Dec 2013 11:54:31 +0100
Subject: [Open-access] Institutional deposits and retracted papers
In-Reply-To: <2988EB1C-4B44-401A-944A-6D56AECD06D5@com.ulaval.ca>
References: <2988EB1C-4B44-401A-944A-6D56AECD06D5@com.ulaval.ca>
Message-ID: <CAJZW5i2ikW0ZpLj=YnDFCuHFHmCM0_YnCo=bJdYyxSBwG3MwKw@mail.gmail.com>

In one sense, retraction is impossible. An article that has been published
is out there. What we are in fact discussing is the withdrawal of an
article's peer reviewed status. If the article is in a pre-print, pre-peer
review repository, arguably nothing has changed.

As everyone is increasingly aware, peer review is an imperfect process that
fails to detect many scientific impostures.

In formal research synthesis, one would expect systematic
review/meta-analysis authors searching for studies to include also to be
capable of finding any associated retraction notices.

One might also expect experts within a field to have a more sophisticated
take on its literature than "well, it got through peer review, so it must
be fine."

So finally, we are left with the effects of persistence of bad information
upon whom we might term "vulnerable users" such as the general public,
novice students, and non-speakers of the language in which the article is
published. Surely the answer with this group is to skill them up with the
tools of search and appraisal so that they too approach the literature with
an appropriate pair of tongs, noses wrinkling at the reek, rather than
worrying about shielding them directly from the fact that someone is wrong
on the internet.

Sure, individual journals and repositories will want to compete on how
nicely they can host the discussion that surrounds any scientific work. One
extreme of that discussion is an editor who has presided over the review
process saying "This is frankly fraudulent." But then, such articles then
become interesting for students of scientific fraud, so they should never
just vanish.

My 2 centimes,

Regards to all,

D

Subject: [Open-access] My take on Beall's Rant
Message-ID: <CALQVpOFHhHhMtH7vH48bExXrwohNs=6Xf6WBTp6Z3DMULX2zww@mail.gmail.com>

I am adding take on Beall's attack on OA in my latest blog post, which you
can find here:
http://scitechsociety.blogspot.com/2013/12/bealls-rant.html

Some excerpts:

But is it really too much to ask to avoid the lowest level of political
debate, politics by name-calling?
[...]

Most of us prefer that these decisions are made by the collective and
distributed wisdom of free-market mechanisms.

Unfortunately, the current scholarly-communication marketplace is far from
a free market.

[...]

If Beall believes in the free market, he should support competition from
new methods of dissemination, alternative assessment techniques, and new
journal business models.

	Research Data Access
Message-ID: <CABOTVX_3vXR2SFgCkSHxkG7eiAp1AE=iE8EvhXb+a3UE=y07GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

The RECODE Project (FP7 funded - more info found
http://recodeproject.eu/<http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Frecodeproject.eu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFgxJqhVKKXRinrKVFnj_Id0XCt_g>)
has released a questionnaire with 'the objective of identifying the
technological infrastructural requirements for Open Access to Research Data
in Europe.'.

The second part of the questionnaire differs on whether you define yourself
as a researcher, publisher//librarian, funder or end user, but covers
questions such as:

   - What solutions are you aware of for preservation and curation of
   research data?
   - How do you describe and document the research data you manage,
   including their quality? (Please reference specific standards and
   technologies that you use or are aware of)
   - What solutions are you aware of for searching for and identifying
   relevant data?

Thought it might be of some interest to list members.

Michelle

Subject: [Open-access] Open Data Day 2014 - let's synchronise open science
	data events on 22 Feb!
Message-ID: <CABPM+woEkn6JKGVw3JOKiCcZD=J3MSZPPLyw8+ymBTJXnkP5SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Open Data Day [1] will be taking place on 22 Feb 2014 and people are
gearing up to run events around the world. We would love to coordinate some
on open scientific data!

So what can you do?

   - If you're already running open science activities, make your Feb
   meeting data related and run it on 22 (this is my plan with Oxford Open
   Science).

OR

   - Organise a one-off in your city/university/department

OR

   - Participate in one of the many events already planned around the world.

AND

   - Send us your stories for the OKF blog afterwards!


There are instructions for adding your event to the official Open Data Day
list on the OKF blog [2].

However, do let the list know if you're planning something and we'll do a
round-up here and on the open science blog. Between us we can probably
connect people in similar localities together to help each other out and
make a bigger splash with their event.

Thanks very much!

Jenny

Hey all,

I know I'd be keen to push on with an idea previously floated about
exploring scholarly publishers (and learned societies) and their incomes.
(More information and th ebeginnings of a proposed data expedition found:
http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition).

The Open Knowledge Foundation is going to be doing more work next year
around open access - and it would be great to get some of this data
together to display visually.

Would anyone else be interested in this?

MIchelle

Hi all,

Following Jenny's emails, I thought it would be a good idea to start a new
email conversation for the seven people who signed for this, but couldn't
find the email addresses on the pad. I had planned to do this earlier, but
university work has been really busy before the Christmas break. My
apologies for this.

During this time, I have been able to find company overviews for Informa PLC
(with information about the Academic division) and John Wiley & Sons. I have
attached the two overviews for your information. I think these files are
useful to update the information made available for 2011 in the various
journalistic sources distributed earlier by email.

As an update to those figures, the Academic Information (AI) division of
Informa PLC had revenues of ?340.3 million ($539.3 million) in 2012. This
represented an increase of 5.2% over 2011. The picture for the whole group
is mixed, as even though there was a decrease of the operating profit, the
net profit went up by more than 20% to ?90.7 million ($143.7 million). The
operating profit for the AI division was 36% of the whole group's.

According to my own calculations the academic information division had an
operating profit of ?44.78 million in the FY2012.

In the case of John Wiley & Sons, according to the company overview
attached, "the operating profit of the company was $280.4 million during
FY2012, an increase of 13% over FY2011. The net profit was $212.7 million in
FY2012, an increase of 23.8% over FY2011." Their scientific, technical,
medical and scholarly division represents 58.4% of their revenue, whilst
higher education is 17.3%.

I have not been able to find similar overviews for Elsevier and Springer's.
But I just wanted to check with the group how to proceed from here before
trying to dig a bit further.

With Christmas round the corner, a sensible option may perhaps be a group
videoconference in the new year. I have found out that Google Hangouts work
really well for this purpose. It could just be an informal conversation to
introduce ourselves and, if possible, come up with a plan of action for the
following weeks. Would this be something the group would be interesting in
doing?

Best wishes
Juan

Hangout in the new year sounds good to me, too.

Heather has offered a contribution to our special issue on publishing reform, so anything we can get out of this might be worth considering for this article.

What do you think, Heather?

All the best,

Subject: [GOAL] Joint Statement on Principles of Transparency and Best
Practice in Scholarly Publishing
To: goal at eprints.org


 The Committee on Publication Ethics<http://publicationethics.org/%E2%80%8E>,
the Directory of Open Access Journals <http://www.doaj.org/>, the Open
Access Scholarly Publishers Association <http://oaspa.org/>, and the World
Association of Medical Editors <http://www.wame.org/> are scholarly
organizations that have seen an increase in the number of membership
applications from both legitimate and non-legitimate publishers and
journals. Our organizations have collaborated in an effort to identify
principles of transparency and best practice that set apart legitimate
journals and publishers from non-legitimate ones and to clarify that these
principles form part of the criteria on which membership applications will
be evaluated.



 This is a work in progress and we welcome feedback on the general
principles and the specific criteria. Please see the full
statement<http://oaspa.org/principles-of-transparency-and-best-practice-in-scholarly-publishing/>on
the OASPA blog (

Hi all,

Following Jenny?s emails, I thought it would be a good idea to start a new
email conversation for the seven people who signed for this, but couldn't
find the email addresses on the pad. I had planned to do this earlier, but
university work has been really busy before the Christmas break. My
apologies for this.

During this time, I have been able to find company overviews for Informa PLC
(with information about the Academic division) and John Wiley & Sons. I have
attached the two overviews for your information. I think these files are
useful to update the information made available for 2011 in the various
journalistic sources distributed earlier by email. 

As an update to those figures, the Academic Information (AI) division of
Informa PLC had revenues of ?340.3 million ($539.3 million) in 2012. This
represented an increase of 5.2% over 2011. The picture for the whole group
is mixed, as even though there was a decrease of the operating profit, the
net profit went up by more than 20% to ?90.7 million ($143.7 million). The
operating profit for the AI division was 36% of the whole group's. 

According to my own calculations the academic information division had an
operating profit of ?44.78 million in the FY2012. 

In the case of John Wiley & Sons, according to the company overview
attached, ?the operating profit of the company was $280.4 million during
FY2012, an increase of 13% over FY2011. The net profit was $212.7 million in
FY2012, an increase of 23.8% over FY2011.? Their scientific, technical,
medical and scholarly division represents 58.4% of their revenue, whilst
higher education is 17.3%. 

I have not been able to find similar overviews for Elsevier and Springer?s.
But I just wanted to check with the group how to proceed from here before
trying to dig a bit further. 

With Christmas round the corner, a sensible option may perhaps be a group
videoconference in the new year. I have found out that Google Hangouts work
really well for this purpose. It could just be an informal conversation to
introduce ourselves and, if possible, come up with a plan of action for the
following weeks. Would this be something the group would be interesting in
doing?

Best wishes
Juan

Ok, I'm not sure I'll be able to help much. I could list what kinds of data
would be helpful.

For instance, stuff like this from Heather:

Subject: [Open-access] Open Data Access Point in R
Message-ID: <CAE6PyGobs9w71U=nh-h2255hab1_bTCfSoNNZDVz0yOY+xXPwA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members,

My proposal would be to have a thesaurus of navigation for an open data
catalog in multiple languages so I can plug it into
http://subject.ro/index.php?uri=uat.rdf (as a uri)
That way we can index data, messages/comments about the data, and offer
metadata back into R.

1. Why bring open data to R as a priority?
Because R has a very extensive library of algorithms and behavior that
complements any data.

2. Why subject.ro? What is subject.ro / what it plans to be?
We want to make it a general ontology based on the SKOS Thesaurus format.
For very easy human-led categorization as well as machine-readable.
We plan it as a gateway to liked and open data / indexed by subject. On the
web as well as in R.
our demo is for the ontology of Astronomy on their draft thesaurus (not
completed with all URIs) - so expect bugs from this side..

3. We would first begin with subject.ro data and behavior as a "portal" to
linked data in R because that will bring in R qualitative dimensions (by
controlled vocabularies). R is presently very good for quantitative data
but lacks ability to compute semantics.

4. subject.ro will keep it's data available for replication and
synchronization (for now in mysql, but with plans for CouchDB). We will
have mobile, desktop apps for interfacing with this data as well as in R
and the website. CouchDB is very good for distributed db.
We have extensive experience in programming for all platforms: web, mobile,
desktop for all operating systems. But we will need more volunteer
programmers for faster returns :)


Now I would like to talk about what we have already done to see the link to
our plans for subject.ro :
in http://sliced.ro/docs/docs/Science.html we have demoed some things that
we would like in R:

for each thesaurus we propose:
-have all terms at singular as number and masculine as gender (for the
appropriate languages)
-have the least number of words per term (prefer hyphenated and composed
word)
-have only the eponyms capitalized
-prefer the same number of words per term as the English term
-prefer to include in the term part of the inheritance (a term should
uniquely-define the reality without the need to know it's ancestry in the
graph) or have 2 versions of the thesauri: one with intrinsic identity and
one with possible extrinsic identity
-there should be just one preferred term for each language
-we also have to know for each term if it has single or multiple
inheritance

We should talk about each rule and I will tell you why I have reached these
conclusions. They are not the only possible solution.

Each language should have a function with the ability to form term's plural
and feminine forms.
There should be a function that takes in a text and a language code and be
able to compile a list of terms it contains.
There should be a function that takes in a text, a language and a target
language. It will return an exact translation for controlled terms and an
approximate translation of the rest using Google Translate.

As for Semantic Web processing: For any text+language:
There should be a function that returns the greater common term: the term
that contains all the other mentioned terms.
There should be a function that returns the smallest distinctors (an
invented idea): the terms that are the most detailed (the leaves in the
thesaurus graph)

Thesauri data and all these functions should be available in R (in the
subject.ro package).


We need scientific guidance on where this technology should lead and what
usecases can be derived. Please feedback.
