by
Heather Piwowar <http://researchremix.wordpress.com/author/researchremix/>

A Nature editor contacted me in November, asking if I'd like to write a
Comment about the upcoming NSF policy change in Biosketch instructions.  It
sounded like a great chance to talk about the value of alternative research
products with a wide audience, so I agreed.  The comment was published
yesterday and is now available here:

Piwowar H. (2013). Value all research products, Nature, 493 (7431) 159-159.
DOI: 10.1038/493159a <http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F493159a>

Because of Nature's policies about copyright assignments for Comments, the
comment is not open access and it is behind a paywall.  Arg.  That said, I
requested that it be one of their "free" articles and they agreed, so it
will be freely available at the above link for a week or two.  I will post
the text up on my website as soon as I am able, 6 months from now.

Working on a blog post about the process behind the scenes, because it was
certainly unlike anything else I've published to date!

Questions about the piece, or thoughts or opinions?  Welcome below, or on
twitter to @researchremix <https://twitter.com/researchremix>.

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzWvEfhAA64xKa9P6HP4xh27-Fgeu0rf34Vp=he3pvtYg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Jevin (I have cc'd the OA list to help spread the word),

I've just seen your paper *Cost-effectiveness of open access
publications<http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/CostEffectiveness.pdf>
*& the associated dynamic plot <http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/>.

"*We believe that it would be wiser for funders to support open access in
ways that encourage price competition among*
*open access publishers.*"  - I heartily agree with your coda.

This is brilliant, much-needed, timely work. Congratulations.
I've seen it said countless times in 2012 that 'Gold OA' journals
*require *APCs.
This plot & data will *convincingly* help dispel that myth and many more in
the wider community.

I was wondering if you had considered adding extra or alternative
dimensions to the plot such as 'Openness of licence'

I have done such a plot
here<http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/08/30/a-visualization-of-gold-open-access-options/>which
garnered a fair bit of attention from the library, publishing, and OA
communities back in August 2012.
I intended to make a dynamic/interactive version but didn't have the skills
or time available. Have also been promoting the idea of 'cost-savvy
OA'<http://prezi.com/sxzg6om0ipgp/open-access/>


Is it possible to download the underlying data from the plot somewhere? I'd
be interested in building upon / exploring this excellent dataset.


Kind regards,


Ross

 The UK's House of Lords (upper chamber of Parliament) Science & Technology
Committee is conducting an enquiry into Open Access. Written submissions
are welcome. Individuals and organisations are invited to give their views
on the actions taken by Government and RCUK following publication of the
Finch report.

The HoL has issued guidance  <
http://www.openscholarship.org/jcms/c_7334/hol-guidance-notes-open-access-enquiry>
on how to make written submissions.

In particular, there are four issues highlighted by the committee:

   - support for universities in the form of funds to cover article
   processing charges, and the response of universities and HEIs to these
   efforts
   - embargo periods for articles published under the Green model
   - engagement with publishers, universities, learned societies and other
   stakeholders in the development of research council Open Access policies
   and guidance
   - challenges and concerns raised by the scientific and publishing
   communities, and how these have been addressed


The deadline is 18th January.

By all means, yes. But what's CRUCIAL is that we send our individual
responses as soon as possible, and don't let that get held up or
derailed by a potentially long-winded process of putting together one
we can all sign up to.

  It is certainly worth any subscriber to this list who supports open
access submitting evidence, whether institutional or personal. Submissions
to the 2004 Enquiry by the equivalent House of Commons Select Committee
were taken seriously and many did influence the Committee?s Report,
although (unfortunately) not the UK Government?s Response. I urge everybody
not to tie themselves too closely to the four issues highlighted by the
Committee. In particular it would be good to see submissions which look at
OA from researchers? or taxpayers? perspectives.

This is an outstanding document and says 80% of what I would have said.

Rather than repeat it I suggest we create a response from the
researchers/readers point of view stressing those not employed in UK
universities (i.e. mainly the scholarly poor). I think we can reasonably
argue that Open public scientific research is a massive public good and
that by opening our research we are contributing to the welfare and
prosperity of those outside Britain as well as in it. I suspect that this
will have particular appeal to the Lords. To that extent I think we could
reasonably  take the approach:
* OKF is a global movement (with UK origins)
* we have collected significant experience and anecdotal evidence through
our activities
* this is almost certainly a very small proportion of the actual desire for
scholarly information
* in this area Britain's actions are a major beacon for the rest of the
world.

Hi folks,

 It's been a while since the last FOSsil Bank update, both because I've
been busy and because I haven't found many new works recently. I've also
stopped adding most non-libre works when I come across them, which means
this update has the greatest ratio of libre to non-libre works so far.

 As always, if you know of works under public copyright licences (and,
particularly, under free/libre/open licences) you can add them to the wiki
yourself or email me and I'll add them. The same is also true for
free/libre/open projects that are available for sale or are in the process
of being crowdfunded, which I tweet about using the hashtag
#FundFreeCulture.
Dedication

This update is dedicated to Aaron
Swartz,<http://rememberaaronsw.tumblr.com/>who died on the 11th of
January.
#FundFreeCulture

The Free Software Foundation is still running a membership
drive.<http://www.reddit.com/r/freeculture/comments/14uvro/the_free_software_foundation_needs_your_support/>

The FSF also has a Defective by Design
drive<http://www.defectivebydesign.org/2012-appeal>going.
 Follow-up

So You Want to Be a Librarian <https://unglue.it/work/76348/> successfully
funded on unglue.it, though the libre edition is not yet available. It
raised $2,682 of its $2,500 goal (this goal was revised down from the
original of $9,000 before the campaign ended). (CC BY-SA)

The third Vicious Crucible (pick-up-and-play tabletop RPGs), Argentate
Drift<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/viciouscrucible/vicious-crucible-3-argentate-drift>,
successfully funded on Kickstarter. ($2,493/$2,000) (CC BY-SA)

a voxel-based electronic game, failed to fund on Kickstarter. ($403/$49,000)

Wikipedia could still do with more donations, but its fundraising
drive<https://donate.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:FundraiserLandingPage>
appears
to be over.

Given the mining bit (from the PDF)

*(iv) Text and data mining for scientific research purposes*
This work strand should
? Identify the scale and nature of demand for TDM access in the EU for
scientific research purposes, and appropriate means of meeting this demand.
? Explore the potential and possible limits of standard licensing models.
? Assess the appropriateness and feasibility of technology platforms to
facilitate TDM
access.
? Deliver solutions, including the possibility to develop effective
platforms to facilitate
TDM access.


If I could get my Panton Fellowship travel allowance to cover this, I would
go. Seems appropriate / relevant to the work I've been doing.

Best,

Ross

Great news! There are no formal page limits. If you sail past 8 pages it
might be time to consider slowing down, and after 12 pages it's almost
certainly time to take a break, but that said... whatever is needed to get
the job done.

dear all,


this was new to me: the scholarly kitchen reports that an "US policy on

would include STM data, unlike the sk-author I would welcome such an 
initiative.

Dear OKFN lists,


Jevin West has kindly made available the list of 985 journals and their
publishers that he uses in his excellent OA plot here:
http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/index.php


I would like to build on this data to assess the licence used by each one
of those 985 journals to publish their articles.
I have started the task on a collaborative, editable Google Spreadsheet
here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdExBQm9UclBSaWxlMWVNelVDMHFnSkE


If you have some spare time, or are interested in helping out please help
us fill-in the data on spreadsheet, on the second sheet called 'Data'.

It's pretty simple to help out. Just Google the journal name given in
column A, and try and find out what licence it publishes its Open Access
articles under e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC BY)

Then fill-in the relevant details you find on the spreadsheet, in columns C
& D and (optionally) your name too in column F (added by)
All data filled-in on the datasheet will be public data for anyone to
use/copy/remix CC0 http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

I have already scored 531 of the journals, so there's 454 left still to
score - I need your help to get this task done!
Many hands make light work...


Best,

Ross

I strongly endorse Ross's call for help. It's not much effort and highly
valuable and will further emhasize the value of Panton Fellowships in OKF

There will, however, be MANY applications of crowdcrafting in schol pub.
One thing that would be really valuable is microtasks whcih could be
launched when people read/access a publication or publisher. Let's say you
have volunteered to help with this. Later you read a paper from a journal
not already processed.The system alerts you "would you like to annotate
this paper?" and then you do it. Or, "would you like to put this
publisher/paper into the task list?"

For the latest work I have done on Bibserver, I considered the use of
crowdcrafting too - I have not done it yet, but it is now possible to get
bibserver to generate something like a list of similar articles which could
then be passed to a crowdcrafting app for deduplication or cleanup, or
collection of license terms or links to where an article can be downloaded.

Exactly.

Given I just submitted something lengthy yesterday to the House of Lords
inquiry, I'm alarmed that the "witness guidance" PDF for this new BIS call
for evidence states:


"Respondees are requested not to submit copies of responses to other
consultations or to the Finch Report"

I feel slightly cheated having submitted some of my 'best' to the House of
Lords inquiry. I have half a mind to make this point in my BIS submission.
 I think I will now have to re-word, re-arrange and re-focus.

Above all we must not be put off from airing our legitimate views and
evidence.

Hi Everyone,

Just wanted to let you know we?re organizing a meetup in London for Open
Data Day 2013 (23rd February):

http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5276951504

Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to
write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish
analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the
adoption of open data policies by the world's local, regional and national
governments.

The event is open to all, curious citizens, journalists, tech-geeks,
students, scientists, graphic designers. Swing by on the day to hack, have
a hangout and wrangle!

Out of interest does anyone know why we are having all of these
renewed consultations and inquiries?

I know there has been quite a lot of behind the scenes lobbying against the
Finch proposals from publishers, learned societies and others.

I wonder if these consultations and inquiries are related to these
complaints and criticisms? If so I wonder whether it would be worth very
publicly restating the case for Finch?

Yes - I think it would. Without too much effort I think we can say that
Finch set out a valuable trajectory for Open scientific research and
publication and we hope that BIS would adopt it and the RCUK implementation
with little change.

Otherwise we are going to suffer death by exhaustion.

Subject: [Open-access] Is Open Access still relevant? | invitation to a
	discussion
Message-ID: <CAOCrZ=SumGsLVhUJ3QXxsCKcj9h=PJ0G4m6CpAK6NKTPV6Zajg@mail.gmail.com>

Is Open Access still relevant?

The last years have been both satisfying and challenging for the Open
Access community worldwide. On one hand, we have experienced numerous
'victories' of the OA agenda, such as the OA policy of Research Council UK,
the Finch Committee report, and the OA policy of World Bank. Various
agreeable arguments have been made forcefully to highlight the need for a
transition to OA models of publication -- from betterment of academic
practices, to economic growth to human development. On the other hand, the
OA agenda seems like only one, and not a major one at that, 'openness'
movement among a crowd of similarly prefixed movements. Further, the OA
agenda increasingly appears to be a rather limited, rigid, and old one.
Many other 'openness' movements such as Open Data and Open Educational
Resources, one may argue, are more effectively designed to better academic
practices, drive economic growth and influence human development.

In a powerful critique of the existing OA agenda, Peter Murray-Rust asks:
'Is "Open Access" the same sort of beast [as the modern ideology and
practice of "Open"]?' <http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/26/is-open-access-open/>.
He goes on to list out the features of this 'modern ideology and practice
of "Open"': meritocracy, universality of participation, a willingness to
listen, openness of process, openness of results, and a mechanism to change
current practices (please see his blog post for clarification of these
features). Instead of having 'open' self-reflections about the changing
context and the need for revised strategies, as Eve Gray explains, the OA
agenda has often remained haunted by the Budapest Open Access Initiative
past and failed to interact with emerging allies such as OA scholarly
publications and grey literatures.

To ask the looming question bluntly, is there a need to envision a new,
more contemporary if nothing else, version of the OA agenda?

In the face of increasing acceptance of OA for journal-based research
publications by national and super-national bodies, what are the next
frontiers of the OA agenda? Does the journal-centric strategy of the
existing OA agenda needs revisiting? The last question is especially
pertinent in the context of developing countries, where policy-making is
often influenced by privately-funded research. Access to such documents
(and their underlying datasets) are significant in such cases for ensuring
government accountability, or simply to induce a broad, informed discussion
regarding making of national policies. At the same time, the diversity of
national policy frameworks across the world poses a critical challenge to
any global movement that aims to address global concerns while engaging
with local specificities and demands. Similarly for OA agenda, it is
crucial to discuss the possibility of a more participatory, flexible and
open process of setting strategic agendas at national and regional scales.
In this context, it might be useful to revisit the BOAI definition of OA,
and question whether this definition is sufficient for a global OA agenda,
and also whether the existing OA models (such as Gold and Green OA) are
sufficient for delivering the promise of that definition.

To return to the context of various 'openness' movements unfolding
worldwide, one may ask, if the OA agenda is now best pursued by dissolving
it within other 'openness' movements? Should we talk more of an alliance
between various 'openness' movements, or an expansion of some to
incorporate the others?

I think this is a great idea. Wiki* is increasingly going to underpin
scholarship (academia has not done a very good job).

You should keep in touch with DOAJ (directory of OA journals). It's been
relaunched. They have been patchy up to now, but may gte more comprehensive
in the future. Possibilities include:
* you feed off them.
* they feed of you
* mutual feeding.

They *should* be able to differentiate between licences. I think they don't
regard it as high priority.

At the risk of flooding almost all OKF lists I have added Open
Bibliography. Mark MacGillivray and others have tools for starting to
interrogate documents and their metadata about licences. Early days. But if
DOAJ don't do it, we shall have to use machines to do it.

Being able to search via license is on my wish list for future for DOAJ but yes, its not the highest current priority which is to stabilise the current system, catch up with backlog and start to tackle journal/publisher validation/quality control.

Also worth noting that this would only ever provide the default license at the journal level. Relatively few journals are absolutely consistent in the licenses they use, although the default is a good first approximation.

FWIW I did some analysis of the set of licenses within the Creative Commons subset of DOAJ and CC BY-SA isn't very common. CC BY-NC is more common. The figures are 174 (SA), 1174(BY), 486(NC) from my analysis. Many of these journals don't publish all that much so by articles there's much more CC BY content as this is the default for the larger OA publishers.

Cheers

DOAJ does have a slot in its metadata for licences: for example, if
you search for "acta":
http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=findJournals&uiLanguage=en&hybrid=&query=acta
27 of the 100 journals listed in the first page of results list the licence.

Obviously, though, that's not nearly enough. From my perspective two
top priorities for DOAJ now that it's up and running again are:

1. Populate the Licence field for *all* journals. Obviously not all
journals have an explicit statement of licence, but even for such
journals it's much better that the DOAJ entry clearly state
"unspecified" rather than no say anything.

2. Extend the search form to allow narrowing by licence (and other
criteria, I guess, but this is the big one).

Subject: [Open-access] Royal Society organised Open Access workshop 25th Feb,
	London
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzwB0uO3aweQx2DYyvBrLXcN9Mo33szzGUr4F+X1T5sfg@mail.gmail.com>

The Royal Society is hosting a special one-day workshop to discuss the
implications for scientific researchers of Government and funder policies
on open access publication, including the Research Councils? policy which
will take effect in April 2013 and HEFCE?s evolving policy in relation to
the post-2014 REF.

This will be a practical and constructive workshop that will help identify
and clarify key issues as we move towards implementation of these policies
and will be of particular interest to academic researchers and university
administrators.

*Dame Janet Finch* will chair the event and confirmed speakers include
*Dr Michael
Jubb*, Director of the Research Information Network, *David Sweeney*,
Director for Research, Innovation and Skills at HEFCE, *Dr Tony
Peatfield*, Medical
Research Council, Director of Corporate Affairs, *Professor David Price*,
Vice-Provost, Research, University College London, *Professor Tom Welton*,
Head of Chemistry at Imperial College, *Phil Sykes*, Librarian, University
of Liverpool, *Ian Russell*, Editorial Director, Science at Oxford
University Press, *Dr Nicola Gulley*, Editorial Director, IOP Publishing and
*Professor Geoffrey Smith*, Head of Department of Pathology, University of
Cambridge and *Professor Miles Padgett*, Dean of Research, University of
Glasgow.

The workshop will look at the background to the new policy announced by
David Willetts in July 2012, including the recommendations of the Finch
working group, and will address the practical challenges of implementation
from the perspectives of research funders, university and research
administrators, university librarians, publishers and different scientific
research communities.  It will also consider the implications of the
requirement of the Research Councils and the Wellcome Trust for authors to
use the CC-BY licence for their journal papers and conference proceedings.

The meeting will be held at the Royal Society on 25 February and is
sponsored by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Institute of Physics, The
Royal Society, The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Society of Biology.

Subject: [Open-access] BIS open access inquiry
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEwMcmnK2S9QUjOEdVYyfppU-hahV69mXgN3MvqPeK8tOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear lists,


Following-on the House of Lords
inquiry<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/open-access/>,
there is also a Business, Innovation and Skills Committee inquiry into the
new RCUK open access mandate. A fair few of the 70 or so written evidence
submissions<http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/Openaccess/OpenAccessevidence.pdf>
 to the House of Lords inquiry were quite misguided in my opinion and few
were from active researchers like myself.

I was wondering therefore if you would perhaps consider submitting some
written evidence to the BIS inquiry, further details
here<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news/committee-announces-an-inquiry-into-open-access/>
.

The Committee will consider a range of topics including:

   - The Government?s acceptance of the recommendations of the Finch Group
   Report ?Accessibility, sustainability, excellence: how to expand access to
   research publications?, including its preference for the ?gold? over the
   ?green? open access model;
   - Rights of use and re-use in relation to open access research
   publications, including the implications of Creative Commons ?CC-BY?
   licences;
   - The costs of article processing charges (APCs) and the implications
   for research funding and for the taxpayer; and
   - The level of ?gold? open access uptake in the rest of the world versus
   the UK, and the ability of UK higher education institutions to remain
   competitive.

Written evidence should be sent to the Committee, as an MS Word document,
by e-mail to biscommem at parliament.uk.
The deadline for BIS submissions is 7 February 2013.

I am particularly concerned about the confusion in many recent blog posts
in certain quarters over what Creative Commons licences actually do. Some
have been attempting to portray the CC Attribution licence (CC BY)  as
against 'author rights' or against 'academic freedom'. It would be good to
make clear the benefits of this, perhaps even in terms of economics.


This is a rare opportunity for for our voices to be heard. We should not
waste this opportunity. Academic publishers will almost certainly be
submitting their viewpoints and interests, so we need to make sure our
interests are represented too.


Best,

Ross
