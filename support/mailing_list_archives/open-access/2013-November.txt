I just read the news story "BMA ? Fight for open access research in joint
thunderclap protest<http://bma.org.uk/news-views-analysis/news/2013/november/fight-for-open-access-research-in-joint-thunderclap-protest>"
in OATP Primary, the forum managed by Prof. Peter Suber of Harvard
University.

First of all BMA should make its own publications 100% open access. Try
accessing BMJ and you will know what I mean.

All the same, I support this venture.

Best.

The Ninth International Conference on Open Repositories, OR2014, will be
held 9-13 June 2014 in Helsinki, Finland. The organizers are pleased to
invite you to contribute to the program. This year's conference theme is:

            *Towards Repository Ecosystems*

Repository systems are but one part of the ecosystem in 21st century
research, and it is increasingly clear that no single repository will serve
as the sole resource for its community. How can repositories best be
positioned to offer complementary services in a network that includes
research data management systems, institutional and discipline
repositories, publishers, and the open Web? When should service providers
build to fill identified niches, and where should they connect with related
services?  How might these networks offer services to support organizations
that lack the resources to build their own, or researchers seeking to
optimize their domain workflows?

Examining how repositories best integrate into the holistic research flow;
exploring ties between domain-specific repositories and institutional
repositories; and understanding durable content strategies outside of
traditional repository environments are the central themes of the Open
Repositories 2014 conference. We welcome proposals on these themes, but
also on the theoretical, practical, organizational or administrative topics
related to digital repositories. We're particularly interested in hearing
about:

* Unconventional approaches to repository-like services
* Interconnection between publishers and repositories
* Researcher-centered design for scholarly workflows
* Adaptations to support curation lifecycle management, e.g., for research
data
* Real-world scalability and performance stories: working at web-scale,
with big data for global usage
* Requirements for holding restricted or classified data in repositories
* Infrastructure to accommodate national and international mandates for
data management and open access
* Positioning repositories closer to (local, consortial, or cloud-based)
cyberinfrastructure for data processing
* Leveraging connections to external services including:
            * Remote identifier services (e.g., DOI, ORCID)
            * (Re-)using repository data/metadata in new and unexpected
ways, including integrated discovery
            * Scholarly social media services, such as for annotation,
review, comment, reputation, citation, and altmetrics
            * CRIS and research management systems
            * Digital preservation tools, services & infrastructure
* Community and sustainability in an open world


*KEY DATES*

            ? 3 February 2014: Deadline for submissions
            ? 4 April 2014: Submitters notified of acceptance to general
conference
            ? 17 April 2014: Submitters notified of acceptance to interest
groups
            ? 9-13 June 2014: OR2014 conference


SUBMISSION PROCESS

*Conference Papers and Panels*
We welcome proposals that are at least two pages and no more than four
pages in length for presentations or panels that deal with digital
repositories and repository services. Abstracts of accepted papers will be
made available through the conference?s web site, and later they and
associated materials will be made available in a repository intended for
current and future OR content. In general, sessions are an hour and a half
long with three papers per session; panels may take an entire session.
Relevant papers unsuccessful in the main track will automatically be
considered for inclusion, as appropriate, as an Interest Group presentation.

*Interest Group Presentations*
One to two-page proposals for presentations or panels that focus on use of
one of the major repository platforms (DSpace, ePrints, and Fedora) are
invited from developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators
and practitioners describing novel experiences or developments in the
construction and use of repositories involving issues specific to these
technical platforms.

*24x7 Presentation Proposals*
We welcome one- to two-page proposals for 7 minute presentations comprising
no more than 24 slides. Similar to Pecha Kuchas or Lightning Talks, these
24x7 presentations will be grouped into blocks based on conference themes,
with each block followed by a moderated discussion / question and answer
session involving the audience and whole block of presenters. This format
will provide conference goers with a fast-paced survey of like work across
many institutions, and presenters the chance to disseminate their work in
more depth and context than a traditional poster.

*"Repository Rants" 24x7 Block.*
One block of 24x7's at OR14 will revolve around "repository rants": brief
expos?s that challenge the conventional wisdom or practice, and highlight
what the repository community is  doing that is misguided, or perhaps just
missing altogether. The top proposals will be incorporated into a track
meant to provoke unconventional approaches to repository services.

*Posters, Demos and Developer  "How-To's"*
We invite developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators and
practitioners to submit one-page proposals for posters, demonstrations,
technical how-tos and technology briefings. Posters provide an opportunity
to present work that isn?t appropriate for a paper; you?ll have the chance
to do a 60-second pitch for your poster or demo during a plenary session at
the conference. Developer "How-To's" will provide a forum for running a
mini-tutorial or demonstration in the developer lounge, if there are enough
interested parties.

*Developer Challenge*
Each year a significant proportion of the delegates at Open Repositories
are software developers who work on repository software or related
services, and once again OR2014 will feature a Developer Challenge. An
announcement will be made in the future with more details on the Challenge.
Developers are also encouraged to make submissions to the other
tracks--including posters, demonstrations, and 24x7 presentations--to
present on recently completed work and works-in-progress.

*Workshops and Tutorials*
One- to two-page proposals for Workshops and Tutorials addressing
theoretical or practical issues around digital repositories are welcomed.
Please address the following in your proposal:

            ? The subject of the event and what knowledge you intend to
convey
            ? Length of session (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour? half a day? whole
day?)
            ? How many attendees you plan to accommodate
            ? Technology and facility requirements
            ? Any other supplies or support required
            ? A brief statement on the learning outcomes from the session
            ? Anything else you believe is pertinent to carrying out the
session

Submit your paper, poster, demo or workshop proposal through the conference
system. PDF format is preferred. Please include presentation title,
authors? names and affiliations in the submission. The conference system
will be open for submissions by 16 December 2013, and is linked from the
conference web site: http://or2014.helsinki.fi/

Subject: [sparc-oaforum] Call to Action: Oppose Section 302 of the proposed
FIRST Act
To: SPARC Open Access Forum <sparc-oaforum at arl.org>

A discussion draft of the Frontiers in Innovation, Research, Science and
Technology Act of 2013 (FIRST), currently being circulated within the House
Science Committee, would impose significant barriers to the
public?s ability to access taxpayer funded research by restricting federal
science agencies? ability to provide timely, equitable, online access to
articles and data reporting on the results of research that they support.

One provision of the proposed bill ? Section 302 ? would extend the embargo
period after which federally funded research must be made freely available *to
up to three years after publication*.  This extension
would undercut federal agencies? ability to effectively implement the
widely-supported White House Office of Science and Technology Policy
Directive on Public Access to the Results of Federally Funded Research,
undermine the public access program pioneered by the National Institutes of
Health (NIH), and significantly hurt the utility of US public access policy.

You can learn more about Section 302 of the proposed FIRST Act and how it
would delay public access to publicly funded research on the SPARC website:
http://www.sparc.arl.org/advocacy/national/first.

*SPARC asks supporters of Open Access to take the following steps to ensure
Section 302 doesn?t roll back the White House Directive:*


   1. *Ask your representatives in Congress to oppose language in the
   proposed FIRST Act to delay public access (Section 302) now through our
   Legislative Action Center: http://www.congressweb.com/SPARC/22
   <http://www.congressweb.com/SPARC/22>*
   2. Tweet at your legislators to oppose Section 302 of the FIRST Act and
   directly at Representative Lamar Smith (@LamarSmithTX21), Chairman of the
   House Science Committee.
   3. Forward this call to action or a link to the SPARC action page for
   the FIRST Act to friends, colleagues, and email lists.  Post about the bill
   to personal or organizational social media channels.
   4. Write an op-ed or letter to the editor about Section 302 of the FIRST
   Act for your local or campus newspaper, blog, or other publication outlet.

Thanks in advance for your support in ensuring Section 302 does not become
law.

Best,

Nick

We could have seen this coming. Publishers seem to be fairly confident that
Open Access is a movement that will not be able to breach their businesses.
There are people, and I am one of them who have said from the onset that
allowing embargo periods for publishers was the wrong strategy. Now is the
time to really demand free and immediate access to all publications and
nothing less.
A large number of open access journals show this is a valid option

Unfortunately, this is the problem of moving the discussion and
implementation of open access to the national political stage. Earlier this
year, I wrote the following (
http://scitechsociety.blogspot.com/2013/03/open-access-politics.html):

"There are also reasons for concern. As this new phase of the OA movement
unfolds on the national political stage, all sides will use their influence
and try to re-shape the initial policies to further their respective
agendas. The outcome of this political game is far from certain. Worse, the
outcome may not be settled for years, as these kind of policies are easily
reversed without significant voter backlash."

[...]

"Academic libraries, which enthusiastically supported and developed Green
OA, now enter this political arena in a weak position. The White House
memorandum all but ignores them. Before complacency sets in, there is
precious little time to argue a compelling case for independent
institutional or individual repositories preserved in a long-term archive.
After all, government-run repositories may disappear at any time for a
variety of reasons."

The political approach may be necessary to get OA enacted, but we need to
implement OA in such a way that it is immune from political influence. In
my book, that seems to be a perfect role for libraries.

This is a serious problem with mandates: they are liable to political influence - and billions in $$$ pay for plenty of political influence, way more than we can ever dream of having.

I thus support Eric's motion: we need to move everything in-house, away from any political influence. Libraries are the natural place for that.

Best wishes,

Bjoern

Libraries are definitely places where awareness occurs. They are the sentinels. However, they don't have enough power (generally) to impose Open Access as a permanent reflex with researchers. 
The only way researchers can be convinced is through mandatory pressure from the funders and/or the Academic authorities. And the only way mandates can be imposed is through the research assessment procedures. Everything else lingers or fails. 
(82% compliance with incitative mandates instead of 8% on average with 'soft' mandates).
If the pressure is applied through Green OA mandates, academic freedom is fully respected. All it takes is 5 minutes (max) extra work for each new publication (usually not a daily task).
Considering the benefits for the author(s), the mandate soon becomes accessory.

Rentier makes some good points here. May I add that if deposit in the IR becomes THE way to report to the tenure and promotion committee and funding agencies, this could actually save researchers a lot of time? Currently we do need to report our publications, often to multiple venues with different formatting requirements. I think time comparison studies (current vs Liege style) would be a good investment of time.

[Disclosure: I am an academic with a personal and professional interest in spending fewer evenings and weekends reformatting my CV and more time getting on with research].

Best,

Heather Morrison

You are perfectly correct: this needs to happen on the researchers' side. Which is why we collected all the data on journal rank, as journal rank is what dictates researchers where to publish:

http://www.frontiersin.org/Human_Neuroscience/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00291/full 

With journal rank gone, all that is required is a superior alternative to the status quo. Given the horrible dysfunctionality of our infrastructure, this should be exceedingly easy, see e.g.:

http://www.slideshare.net/brembs/sparc-munich 

> The only way researchers can be convinced is through

I tend to agree that this is ONE way.

However, I would respectfully disagree that this is the ONLY way.

If journal rank no longer dictates where to publish, we don't need to replace this dictatorship with another one. Once we're free to publish where we want, wouldn't we automatically publish in something that's superior to what we have now?

Given how easy it is to provide superior functionality, why would one mandate people to to choose what is already in their best interest to begin with? No mandates are required at all for something every researcher would already do by themselves.

All mandates suffer from the Achilles' heel of political involvement. Once we have to involve politicians for mandates, we loose, because the corporations will always wield more power over politicians.

Obviously, I'm not against green mandates, on the contrary! I'm just saying they're not necessary once we have the freedom to chose where we want to publish (which we don't have now).
Mandates clearly are necessary now.

Best,

Bjoern

I am going to use this opportunity to promote my open scholarship survey
again...

Regardless of awareness or mandates or power, what matters is what can be
done. If people can agree on what the requirements for scholarship are,
then someone will provide what is required. (Perhaps for a price, but that
price can be openly negotiable based on provision of a service that meets
requirements.)

So if enough scholars say "scholarship should be X", then we will know what
to build:

http://ifthisistheanswer.com/survey


If there are not enough people willing to take part in the dialogue and do
something about it, or willing to stand by the consequences, then we will
simply have to shut up and make do with whatever is given to us (and
whatever price is extracted for that privilege).

Stevan, Bernard:
My main concern is not with mandates, but with the repositories themselves.
If memory serves me right, there was at least one unsuccessful attempt to
defund the NIH-run Pubmed repository. ArXiv also had an existential crisis
when run from a government lab.

The weakness of government-run repositories is that those who want to
undermine these repositories have to be successful only once. Those who
support these OA repositories must fend off every attack.

To immunize against this, we need a distributed approach with sufficient
duplication to form an archive that is immune from any one particular
weakness. This is what libraries have always done, and should continue to
do.

Libraries have no role (except as advocates) in enacting and enforcing
mandates, but they can be useful in implementing the mandates effectively
by managing the distributed archive.

In fact, Stevan has made the same arguments against central repositories in
the past. So, I think we are all on the same wave length here up to this
point.

Where I go one step further, is in making the argument that libraries need
to get out of the digital-lending business altogether and dedicate their
efforts to the maintenance and development of the archive. See:

Dear Eric,

I am so completely and utterly on your page. This is precisely the way we need to go and every library meeting I speak at confirms this view: everyone I meet there gives me the feedback that they're ready to go for it.

Thanks for making this important point!

Indeed Heather, in Belgium, we are now achieving total compatibility between universities IRs as well as with the FRS-FNRS (the major Research Funder). Authors have to file in their papers only once. However, if absolutely needed, various formattings can be provided by the software.

I should stress again that after the rough (and tedious) starting period, benefits have become so obvious to researchers that the mandate has become much less necessary: we have entered a bottom-up phase now, generating a huge support for ORBi. Researchers consider it a precious tool today, rather than a chore.

May I add that if deposit in the IR becomes THE way to report to the tenure and promotion committee and funding agencies, this could actually save researchers a lot of time? Currently we do need to report our publications, often to multiple venues with different formatting requirements. I think time comparison studies (current vs Liege style) would be a good investment of time.

Dear Bjoern, Eric and Heather,

I fully agree that it is good practice to duplicate deposits. Actually, there is nothing wrong with that.
And on these lines, I would recommend public repositories. I feel much less at ease with private ones.
We have had terrible experiences with commercial publishers who cut us from accessing contents we had already paid for. That really sobers you up when it happens and it cures you definitively from attempting to trust any private repository of any kind.

Duplication is OK. It increases your chances of being read (which, after all, is the only point here). The thing is that you must make sure that all your Institution's production is complete somewhere, so the best possible place is in your Institutional Repository.

Mandates are very useful to fill up IRs but it takes firm control at the start. After some time, the urge to store their production there is a good incentive enough for researchers and it tends to become a habit (I am am talking here about a mere 5-year experience!).

IRs are much less exposed to politics than Government-run ones. Of course, I live in a country where Government is not excessively intrusive in University policies. However, I agree that one should not rest on a single storage silo.

Subject: [Open-access] Ideology, Archives, and Management
Message-ID: <CALQVpOFVuUkPJoB-CJ1JQgWCHfwL8ohLdNoqYs2SQ1Z-o+1cUw@mail.gmail.com>

As Stevan mentioned, the previous thread "[GOAL] Fight Publishing Lobby's
Latest "FIRST" Act to Delay OA - Nth Successor to PRISM, RWA etc." is
getting a bit unwieldy. So, I am starting this new one to reply to Stevan.
I am cross-posting, because the original thread was.

Scholarly communication is a complex system with many interconnected
components, and it is sometimes difficult to keep discussions focused. In
an effort to be brief, I made the error of making too many logical steps at
once.

Let me give it another try.

1. As a Belgian-American, I do not have a lot of opportunities to say this:
the Belgians have got it right. The Belgian system should be the goal
everywhere: Institutional Repositories integrated into national research
networks. (And, eventually of course, into a global research network.)

2. Right now, the focus should be on getting content into the open-access
universe. Every institution should pursue those open-access policies that
make most sense to them. When formulating their policies, it makes sense to
learn from those institutions who achieved the best results. So yes,
Bernard Rentier and University of Liege deserve to be role models.

Up to this point, I do not think there are fundamental differences.

3. Looking down the road, I want more from IRs than what they currently
offer. I want a system suitable for research, not just access to
information. Such a system will require significant resources to put
together.

I suspect we differ somewhat on this point, but I don't know whether the
difference is on a point of substance or a point of messaging/advocacy.

Every OA advocate has advanced the argument that IRs are cheap to set up
and run. Stevan makes that point often. I have made that point as well. I
realize that I somewhat muddle the messaging when I say that I want more
than what the current system offers. It is not a contradiction to want as
much content as possible in the short term and develop a high-quality
system in the long term. For advocacy purposes, it may indeed be the better
strategy to focus on the simplicity of the initial system and get people
involved.

4. However, those who are interested in the next-generation system should
realize that the resources are available by rebuilding the academic library
from the ground up.

Most of the library budget is eaten up by subscriptions and the overhead of
managing subscriptions. Just by redirecting the overhead spent on managing
subscriptions, we can build the next-generation OA system and born-digital
library institution.

5. In fact, I firmly believe that if libraries continue to spend the
overwhelming part of their budget on digitally recreating the paper
universe, they are setting themselves up for institutional failure. This
last point is independent of OA, and is just based on the different nature
of digital information vs. paper-based information. As this is outside the
scope of the OA discussion, I refer to my blog on this point. (
http://scitechsociety.blogspot.com)

I hope this clarifies things a bit.
My best,
--Eric.

The page is getting a bit crowded, and somewhat illegible!

Of course Eric, Bernard and I agree on the advantages of distributed
institutional repositories over central ones (for direct deposit -- central
repositories are fine for export or harvesting).

And that agreement is not ideological but practical.

But as for librarians getting out of the business of subscribing to
journals -- that's just ideology (and completely unrealistic) as long as
authors don't into the business of self-archiving their published articles
in their institutional repositories.

And that's precisely what Green OA mandates are for.

Without an effective Green OA mandate, institutional repositories are
useless (for OA).

Users need access, now, and if they can't have open access, they at least
need as much subscription access as their institutions can afford.

May I suggest that we clearly distinguish our practical points from those
that are merely ideological desiderata and wishful thinking?

Hi All

I wondered about a potential collaboration between School of Data and the
Open Science/Open Access working groups on a Data
Expedition<http://schoolofdata.org/category/data-expeditions/>around
scholarly publishers and their income.

The bottom line is some make a lot of profit, much of it from public
funding of higher education and research and possibly pay very little tax,
but there's not been much exploration of this beyond some figures on
profits which appear in blogs and a few articles and mostly in text and
tables.

It would be great to try and draw a more comprehensive dataset together,
visualise it and tell some stories.

Some figures:

For PLOS, along with a lot of other non-profits you can get fairly detailed financial information. For US non-profits the Form 990 is required to be filed every year (you can get ones from PLOS at http://www.plos.org/about/what-is-plos/financials/ but you can get them for most organisations online) and for other countries there are often reporting requirements that mean info is available (although frequently they are paper records).

I'd support getting a good set of data together that looks across the publishing landscape.

Cheers

It would be fantastic, I would even say necessary to have that sort of data just to be able to make any meaningful projection of what kinds of reform are feasible.

Especially the kind of revenue streams from scholarly journal publishing (as opposed to scholarly publishing in general) are difficult and/or expensive to obtain. I have seen such analyses from respected financial firms which cost beyond $2k to read (talk about exorbitant TA).

Open access to financial data like these will likely not be easy, but would be very valuable (and probably cost some companies a lot of money, if they can't sell their analysis, e.g. Outsell).

>   Does anyone feel strongly about this and would like to coordinate the project?

I would like to coordinate, but not being an economist, I feel highly inadequate for such a task.

Good luck!

I only partially understand why you argue that getting out of subscriptions at this point in time and into infrastructure is an ideological proposition.

I propose it because I find subscriptions too expensive  compared to other solutions, because the functionality publishers offer is not even in the ballpark of adequate and because publishers do not take care of my data nor my software. Proposing a technically and financially feasible solution that solves all these problems is evidence-based policy, not ideology.

My proposal is not in competition to green mandates, but expands them: I would expand green mandates to cover not only text, but also data and software.

And if they don't interoperate and only cover text and not software and data, they are as good as useless.

That is only correct insofar as you ignore technical solutions to the access problem, afforded by green mandates and other forms of OA.

It is technically simple to develop a crawler that harvests every single article any institution on this planet has access to (and, perhaps more importantly, it is not even illegal :). Placed in a decentralized repository, one can make accessible only these articles which were either published OA, or are in a repository already, or fall under a green mandate but have not been deposited, or where the copyright has expired, or that are legally accessible for some other reason.

The properties can be extracted from articles with a reasonably high degree of accuracy and should cover so much of the current literature, that targeted subscription cuts would hardly be noticed by faculty. For those faculty that would notice, it should not be too difficult to explain that for a limited period of time, there is a limited reduction in access, which will be fully restored as soon as the reform is completed.
What happens after we have the money is a separate issue, for a later time, but quite straightforward.

Why, if few people would notice a drop in access, should we not cut subscriptions in order to finance much needed reform?

Technically, this is not difficult, but it requires international coordination and standards. If you think it is ideology to suggest we coordinate ourselves and agree on standards, then we have probably deserved the quagmire we're in right now and should abandon all reform efforts anyway.

Best wishes,

Bjoern

I agree that this is very important. I have no first-hand experience, but
suggest that at least two publishers, OUP and CUP, as member departments ot
universities, will legally have to answer FOI requests for information. I
have no idea whether their profits are acceptable. We may be able to use
them as calibration/controls on things like:
* how many staff are employed in what departments
* what percentage of revenue is spent on X, Y, Z
* what profits are re-invested
* how much is spent on "public good" (e.g. running conferences)

I suspect a full investigation of a publisher may have to work on
externable observables (staff complement, local taxes, etc.) as well as
income (which may be difficult to determine).

Hi Carl and all

[Cc'ing the open-economics and data-driven-journalism lists in the spirit
of fostering some cross working group collaboration. Please let me know if
this is too off-topic for your lists!]

Thanks for your responses, I agree these are all interesting questions and
we definitely seem short of expertise in economics so I have copied in the
open-economics list where hopefully some economists reside who might be
able to help us in responding to your comments.

Does anybody know of someone doing academic work on this already? The data
expedition format lends itself more to an investigative journalism type
approach, finding what data one can and building a narrative, so my initial
suggestion was not really around an academic study but I think both
approaches would be worthwhile.

If anyone on the ddj list would be interested (or has a contact who would),
please do come and join the discussion on the open-science list - we would
love to hear from you.

Jenny

OA to peer-reviewed journals articles may be useless to you, Bjoern, but
not to those who are denied access to them when they need them. (The OA

Berlin 11 gives a sample of the number of access-denied users for which OA
to journal articles is not so useless?)

I don't know about the legality of this harvesting, but I am pretty sure
that publishers that have been feverishly opposing and embargoing Green OA
and Green OA mandates would not hesitate to go after a 3rd-party
service-provider providing access to their proprietary content where and
when it has not been made OA by its author.

The only one who can provide OA to subscription journal content besides the
publisher (Gold OA) is the author (Green OA). Anything else, provided by a
3rd party today, is (according to laws with which I do not agree but which
are here today) considered
piracy<http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/harnad/Tp/resolution.htm#9.1>today,
and prosecutable.

It would help if suggested solutions stuck to reality, rather than
diverting attention from tried and tested solutions that work (but have not
yet been widely enough adopted) to fantasy solutions that only make sense
in one's imagination.

In the real world, you are saying something along the same lines as what you've
already said<http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1053-Pre-emptive-cancellation-costs-far,-far-more-than-it-saves.html>in
support of an unlikely ally (librarian Rick
Anderson<http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/1051-Is-the-Library-Community-Friend-or-Foe-of-OA.html>)
who proposed cancelling journals that have a higher proportion of Green OA.
That will be an encouraging reward to journals that do not embargo Green
OA, and a useful service to users who can no longer have subscription
access to the balance of such journals' content.

Why, if few people would notice a drop in access, should we not cut

Because reform will come (and the finances will be released) once Green OA
approaches 100% globally, not if we nip Green OA in the bud with *annulatio
praecox *when we're still nowhere near the target.

Green OA grows anarchically, article by article, mandate by mandate, not
journal by journal. So nothing to cancel till we are at asymptote.

Neither third-party harvesting of subscription-journal, non-OA content, nor
the pre-emptive cancelation of journals with higher Green OA content when
Green OA and Green OA mandates are still far from 100% can be described as
"international coordination and standards": It is remarkably unreflective
and un-self--critical armchair fantasy.

hi all,

Study of the dysfunction marketplace that is scholarly communication has been around for a while. In brief, the scholarly journal system has arguably been in a state of crisis for decades. Before the second world war, almost all scholarly journals were published by the non-profit sector (scholarly and learned publishers, university presses). After the second world war, the commercial sector became involved, and are now involved in publishing about half of scholarly journals (sometimes owned outright, other times published on behalf of scholarly societies). The commercial sector itself has been characterized by market consolidation, so that today a very small number of publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer and Informa.plc under the scholar-friendly-sounding brand Taylor & Francis) own a disproprotionate share of the market. This market has been the subject of anti-trust investigation. Open access advocates should note that these large companies are moving into open access. For example, Springer owns BioMedCentral. Wolters Kluwer bought Medknow, a large Indian open access publisher. Meanwhile, Edgar & Willinsky have observed what they call a renaissance in scholar-led publishing. A survey they did of over 900 journals using the free, open source software found that these were the largest group involved in publishing. 

My two next research projects are focused on economics of transition to open access: one on OA article processing fees, and the other on resource requirements to sustain scholar-led scholarly publishing. I would be interested in hearing from others working in this area.

A single company can make large profits as the result of innovations that put them well ahead of the competition, at least for a period of time.

It seems this would suggest to the economist that the marketplace was not efficient, and thus not spurring innovation.

Open Knowledge promotes fast, creative innovation across sectors

Knowledge Exchange delivers a discussion paper exploring the rich field of
open knowledge in order to help our partners effectively achieve their
objectives.

'Open knowledge' is the power to promote fast, creative innovation by
allowing an idea to leave your hands. Essentially, something is 'open' if
anyone is free to use, reuse and redistribute it. It should only be subject
to the requirement to the requirement to attribute the author, if even
that. Knowledge Exchange is exploring the rich field of open knowledge in
order to help our partners effectively achieve their objectives. To this
end, scoping sessions took place with experts which revealed strong views
on the value of making knowledge open and steps which need to be taken to
achieve this. These views are collected in the Knowledge Exchange
discussion paper on Open Knowledge<
http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fdownloads%2fOpen+Knowledge%2fOpen_Knowledge_discussion_paper.pdf
>.
Mechanisms of open creation offer opportunities to work and exchange with
other sectors - research, cultural heritage and government. To make true
use of this collaboration we require an increase of openness, to create
better proposals and solutions. We simply cannot afford to not open up, we
need an open approach to tackle the challenges facing us.
Though we may be easily persuaded about the benefits of open, the practice
is different. People still hold knowledge to themselves or want to make
money from knowledge. The current competitive environment encourages
researchers and employees to seek protection against the theft of their
ideas, which they do by locking down work behind patents and intellectual
property rights. We need to enforce openness as there are not sufficient
incentives at present.
The experts agreed to not just go out making plans or spend time convincing
yourself that open is good.  Get out and about and show new things to
others - convince them there's another way.
The paper closes with suggestions for actions to take when publishing or
funding content.

The discussion paper is available at:

I'm not sure I understand the argument here. Is that supposed to be a justification for keeping subscriptions or an admission that we are stuck with what we have today and can't do anything about that and neither should we try, at least for the time being?

I can see where this plea comes from, but to me it sounds rather like "can we wait, please, until the architect has designed the southern wall of our house, before asking him to design the north, west and east wall as well?"

Our infrastructure is so bad, if it were a house, it only consists of a single wall with a locked glass door: we can look inside, but are not allowed in. Once we get the keys, we can go inside, but realize that the other walls and the roof are missing, leaving the contents open to the weather and, hence, decay. Asking for the key first makes sense, but risks the content as it leaves it unprotected.

We have the wherewithal to do it right in a way such that mandates will not be needed any more when we're done. The plan does not interfere with current mandates, on the contrary, it will complement current mandates by providing an infrastructure that will yield time and effort back to researchers (rather than demanding time and effort from them as current mandates do), by offering them support, rather than demanding extra work. "We will take care of your data and software mandates for you!" is what institutes will say once we have that infrastructure.

I wrote: 'as good as useless'. This is meant relative to OA to just text.

Thus, if just text is useful, integrated OA infrastructure for software, data and text is infinitely more useful.

Or, conversely, relative to the usefulness of an integrated OA infrastructure for software, data and text, OA to text alone is as good as useless.

All I would to do is similar to what, e.g., PMC offers:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=brembs[au] 

These are most of my articles, none of them I put at PMC, some of them I made OA and some of them I had no idea they were OA.

Only it would be on a vastly more comprehensive scale.

In other words, at first, only provide access to articles that are obviously legal. One can discuss the legality and risks of any further steps later, once the ball got rolling.

If my articles are in any way representative, we should be able to cover a large section of the literature like this, probably a vast majority.

Oh, I didn't realize what PMC does (see above) is illegal! If that's the case, this would really be a problem.
I can assure you, from the 11 articles on this page above, I'm only aware of 5 being OA, the other 6 I had no idea. 

So providing access to these 6 articles of mine is illegal? This would indeed be a major obstacle.

I had no idea that PMC was not only illegal, but also a fantasy.

No, I'm not saying we should cut subscriptions from green OA supporting publishers.

I'm saying we should cut the subscriptions that will free the most money, regardless of anything else.

The target is the money, interim access is provided by a harvested database.

For simplicity, let's say 30% cuts lead to a drop in access of 30% of the articles. Let's say the harvested database covers 50% of that, which means a temporary drop in access of just 15%. In my books, any faculty member not willing to accept that tiny price in return for several hours per week in saved time normally spent dealing with data, software and literature is a fool. Not to mention the evidence-based reputation system we'd get to replace this divining rod which is journal rank.

If faculty are not willing to pay this tiny price, we indeed deserve what's coming.

Again, if faculty aren't even willing to accept a temporary 15% drop in access in return for the windfall benefits they receive, we do not deserve any reform whatsoever and ought to bear the consequences.

Why, of all people, would you demand that anything other than 100% OA is insufficient? Why would you let the best (~100%) be the enemy of the better (85%)?

Hi all,

OKFN Labs have just launched a really cool new project highlighting bad
examples of data publishing as a way of learning from their mistakes.

The details of how to take part are here: http://okfnlabs.org/bad-data/add/
It's GitHub based and option 2 is very easy if you're not sure about option
1

I have nominated poor examples from
Nature: https://github.com/okfn/bad-data/issues/4
and Science: https://github.com/okfn/bad-data/issues/5

to kick it off.

If you happen to know of any other really bad examples of published,
accessible supplementary data do upload them! It would be good to see a
diversity of publishers represented.

Best,

Ross

Fine with me, once you have that labour-saving infrastructure.

But what has that to do with cancelling journals while their contents are
not yet available as Green OA?

What's OA is OA, and harvesters, including PMC, will find them.

But the challenge is what is not OA -- and that's still the majority of
articles (in every journal). So no grounds for journal cancelation (except
what's beyond the budget). And no excuse for not implementing a strong,
effective Green OA mandate. The latter will solve all the problems, fast.

Check the articles. Don't just speculate. *Are they accessible full-text?* *Are
they current articles?* (The older articles may have been made accessible
after the elapse of a publisher embargo of a year or more, and as a result
of an agreement with the publisher, in exchange for allowing the embargo --
a Faustian Bargain if ever there was one!)

In the real world, the selection criterion for librarians is not just
budget limits and which subscriptions will free the most money, but which
journals are needed and used the most.

I don't know whether 85% access is the cut-off point, but I do know what
you invented these figures. If we instead invent, say, 75%, 50% or 25%, the
cancelation question looks rather different.

No. If faculty are not willing to pay the tiny price of a few keystrokes to
deposit all their papers (and their funders and institutions are not
willing to mandate it), then we indeed deserve what's coming.

Bjoern, you are speculating about what's 3rd-party harvestable, and you are
inventing access percentages. That means you are merely shadow-boxing with
yourself.

Maybe 85% immediate OA would be enough -- but we are nowhere near 85%
immediate OA (except in your imagination!)

Hello,

I certainly think this is a suitable topic for exploration. I've added my
name to http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition to carry
on with the momentum. I can see though that there's only one more
participant signed up for it at the moment. Just wondering if any people
that participated in the discussion would like to join too.

To what's been said, I would like to add that OA monographs may also suffer
from deficient business models. Open Science journals are certainly taking
the agenda forward in OA, but in the Humanities and certain areas of Social
Sciences, monographs are far more important than journal articles. For
example, it wouldn't be uncommon to have books published 20/30 years as key
readings in undergraduate university modules. These books may have been out
of print for some time but they can't be released as Open Access either. 

Regarding publishing models, it is often overlooked that fees for publishing
Open Access monographs are unaffordable for most research budgets. Palgrave
can charge up to $17,500 + VAT/taxes http://www.palgrave.com/open/faq.asp  

Therefore, if this project goes ahead, it may be interesting to compare
publishing models for books too.

publishing income

hi all,

Study of the dysfunction marketplace that is scholarly communication has
been around for a while. In brief, the scholarly journal system has arguably
been in a state of crisis for decades. Before the second world war, almost
all scholarly journals were published by the non-profit sector (scholarly
and learned publishers, university presses). After the second world war, the
commercial sector became involved, and are now involved in publishing about
half of scholarly journals (sometimes owned outright, other times published
on behalf of scholarly societies). The commercial sector itself has been
characterized by market consolidation, so that today a very small number of
publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Springer and Informa.plc under the
scholar-friendly-sounding brand Taylor & Francis) own a disproprotionate
share of the market. This market has been the subject of anti-trust
investigation. Open access advocates should note that these large companies
are moving into open access. For example, Springer owns BioMedCentral.
Wolters Kluwer bought Medknow, a large Indian open access publisher.
Meanwhile, Edgar & Willinsky have observed what they call a renaissance in
scholar-led publishing. A survey they did of over 900 journals using the
free, open source software found that these were the largest group involved
in publishing. 

My two next research projects are focused on economics of transition to open
access: one on OA article processing fees, and the other on resource
requirements to sustain scholar-led scholarly publishing. I would be
interested in hearing from others working in this area.

Who decides what must-have articles are? Isn't
that faculty? As such, if the faculty agrees that
a subscription cut is justifiable if the funds are
used for developing infrastructure that will not
only solve all access problems but also save them
time, everything's ok?

In other words, if campaigning for subscription
cuts results in faculty agreeing to such cuts, all
must-have articles are covered, be definition.
That need not be the 100% OA access you demand.

These mandates need no justification in this

Like everything, infrastructure cannot be built without
money. You might ask the tax payers for yet more
money, I prefer taking tax payer funds back from
publishers.

Being able to do science is more important than
accessing it - after all, if you can't do science,
there will be nothing to access.

That's what I want to do - on a global scale.

Do you mean new articles or all articles? These
are important numbers so I'd like to have a good
estimate: of all articles that have been published
since 1664, what percentage is openly accessible
today?
My estimate would be a large majority, but I may
well be totally off.

Those are my articles, of course I checked
that they are accessible full text and I know I
published them in a subscription journal (someof
these journals are still subscription journals) and
I honestly have no idea under what agreement they
have moved int PMC.

That these articles are in PMC indicates to me
that your prior statement of the author needing to
put the article OA, cannot be all that accurate:
I'm the author and I had no idea they were OA!

But that's a major component of what I'm trying to
say: in contrast to all current options (at least
those that I use for my field), we can already
offer a large majority of the entire body of
literature in full text with functionalities
nobody else can offer. Obviously, the older
articles will be overrepresented, but we would
still have many subscriptions to cover much of the
newer articles from.

Just temporarily cutting access to a small section
of the latest articles would free enough money  to
build something that everyone will want - simply
because it will save everybody so much time and
effort.

Well, if the goal is to fee funds to develop
infrastructure and libraries do not cut those
subscriptions that will free the most funds, they
will not be able to develop the infrastructure -
that would obviously not only be
counterproductive, it would be outright silly.

If you are arguing that libraries only act silly,
we might as well stop any efforts of reform that
are library-based.

I invent them because we hold the purse strings!
We determine how much access we want to sacrifice
for getting ourselves from the 1990s into the 21st
century. The number is something that needs to be
agreed upon. Once we agreed on, say 18% and we
have 50% coverage due to harvesting the
literature, we can cut 36% of subscriptions (on
average) and have the full support of the faculty.

Obviously, if the faculty agree on 12% and the
coverage is 66%, we can also cut 36%.

First, this is not mutually exclusive so I see no
need to disagree with you.

Second, in my suggestion, faculty only need to
sacrifice once for a temporary period. In the
green scheme, they'd need to sacrifice for the rest
of their careers.

It doesn't take a cognitive psychologist to
realize what will be met with less resistance.

I'm not talking 85% OA - I'm talking 85%
accessibility for faculty which would free up
enough funds to develop a technical solution which
will lead to 100% OA not due to politicians and
funders forcing it, but due to researchers choosing
the most efficient and time-saving way to
communicate.

That would be nice indeed, but the problem is that
(a) finding a publication on a site other than the publisher's does
not necessarily mean that file is legally there, or even that it's
easy to determine (let alone algorithmically) whether that is the case
(b) mining those files may be prohibited by the copyright holder's
terms and conditions.
(c) even in cases where licensing information is available, it is
often not correct.

Problem (b) even exists for most of PubMed Central, and problem (c)
even in the open subset thereof [1]. Problem (a) does not affect PMC
(they have been very careful there), but many other places (e.g.
author's websites).

Instead of crawling for the publications themselves, it may be less
problematic from a legal point of view to just have a platform that
aggregates metadata of publications, along with a link to a legal copy
(green or gold). The problems here are
(d) the metadata is often not present with the file(s) of the
publication, or only incompletely
(e) in some cases, even the metadata may not be licensed for such
programmatic access (I actually do not know of such a case right now,
but I think I saw that somewhere - please chime in if anyone knows
details)
(f) the official repositories are far from interoperable
(g) other repositories (e.g. author websites) are far too short-lived
in order to make harvesting them a useful endeavor for anyone smaller
than Google Scholar (and even repositories fail with that on
occasion[2])

For these reasons, I think it is best to develop crawling
infrastructure around the clearly licensed literature first (which is
a rather small subset at present), and to use that as a basis for
exploring options to broaden access more widely. That's the approach
we have taken with the Open Access Media Importer, which only looks at
articles under CC BY and CC0 and puts their multimedia files onto
Wikimedia Commons[3]. The obvious next step is to think about ways to
aggregate the openly licensed literature (full text plus supplements)
in some way, ideally beyond the scope of biomedicine. We will do some
tests in this direction with Wikisource.

One way to soften the problems (a)-(c) is to signal for any cited
reference whether it can be read, mined, copied etc. The NISO
Workgroup on Open Access Metadata and Indicators[4] is working on
that, and a similar system is currently being explored for references
cited on Wikipedia[5], which would benefit from wider community input.

Cheers,

Daniel

Thanks Daniel for chiming in, this was really helpful. I hope you don't mind a few more comments/questions?

At least for the STEM fields, the consolidation of publishers is really convenient. What I would intend to do is to crawl the publishers' sites (not that many due to consolidation) slowly as if the crawler were a person (or many students) from essentially all participating libraries. The metadata is with the publishers and easy to read. The crawler the strips all the tags that could identify the source of the article (i.e., everything except content), such that each article looks as if it was submitted by the author(s). Then, new tags are being added to all the articles to create a database of all the articles libraries have access to. One tag would denote if the article is unambiguously open access or not.

Every article that is not unambiguously open access, public domain, whatever, is not accessible, not even visible from the outside (except, of course, its meta-data).

> (b) mining those files may be prohibited by the copyright holder's

Another tag would take care of this: miners would only see articles where mining is unambiguously legal. If it can't be determined, no mining.

Without standardized mark-up of the articles, their usefulness would be severely curtailed. This would only be a last resort option, IMHO.

> (f) the official repositories are far from interoperable

That is one of the things that need to be remedied ASAP!

Doesn't copyright expire? Don't the green mandates work retroactively? So everything covered by green mandates (essentially everything with a public funder acknowledged), or where the publisher is not opposed to green deposition, or where copyright has expired or never existed (e.g. US government work, etc.) should be fair game.

All of this seems like a lot - is it really not that much?


Cheers,

Bjoern

The technology to do all of this already exists. Most of the STEM metadata
you describe is actually directly available in Medline, and the core parts
can be used as per the open biblio principles. Crawling the websites is
already possible using pubcrawler and other tools, and finding out what
their stated licence status is can be done with howopenisit (although more
often than not the answer is "not properly defined").

However the hard part is not building or running these things or collecting
all the data, but sustaining it in and imbuing it with credibility.

For example I can run a server with all this on it at not too much personal
expense, but who would treat it as a serious source? Scaling up to handle a
large amount of users and providing a good service does cost money, which I
(we) could probably find a way to fund - but even then, we still have to
solve that credibility problem. It has to be known by those in or entering
the field that "this is where you go to find this stuff" - as opposed to
the current "go to the library and follow all the rules" approach.
