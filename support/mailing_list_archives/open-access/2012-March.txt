Hi ,

Last week we planned the next Skype meeting for tomorrow. I have therefore
made a pad for the meeting at http://open-access.okfnpad.org/4
Is this still OK with you and what time should we pick?

Hi All

I'm currently in hospital having broken my arm this morning but there is
wifi (thank goodness) so I'll attempt to join, 10am would be good for me as
I should be in theatre in the afternoon.
Probably won't be able to make any massive contributions to the
Etherpad.Turns out only using your left hand to type is quite slow.

I'm in Canada (U Alberta) until Saturday, so won't
be able to make it.

Interesting: most people I meet are more
interested in talking about publishing that
telling me about their research, even though I
ask. People are so enraged and frustrated, we need
to 'force' the discussions back on science...

Cheers,

Bjoern

Dear Dr Roberts,

Thank you for your e-mail.

I can advise you to sign your copyright form as normal. Please choose the
option that most applies to you.

If you choose to pay for open access, your paper will be freely available
to all on Science Direct only for all time.

I hope this is of some help to you however if there is anything you are
still not clear about, please do not hesitate to ask and please also
provide me with your reference number or article title for me to check this
in our production tracking system.

You may also find the following link of interest:

http://support.elsevier.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/557

If responding to this e-mail, please ensure that the reference number
remains in the subject line.

Should you have any additional questions or concerns, please visit our
self-help site at: http://support.elsevier.com/. Here you will be able to
search for solutions on a range of topics, find answers to frequently asked
questions and learn more about EES via interactive tutorials. You will also
find our 24/7 support contact details should you need further assistance
from one of our customer service representatives.

Yours sincerely,

Antoinette Duffy

Dear sir/madam,

If I pay for my article to be sponsored so that it is ?available to
non-subscribers? on Elsevier?s ?electronic platform', what copyright
notice do I sign? Elsevier is giving the article away ? that is to say
I have paid for the costs associated with the article ? does Elsevier
still own the copyright, and, more importantly, is the file allowed to
be hosted anywhere else? Or, to put it another way, what is the legal
status of the published article, and what future-proofing is there to
maintain that free access in perpetuity?

Kind regards,

David Roberts

Very interesting.  The notion of "freely available to all on Science
Direct only for all time" suggests (again) that they really haven't
thought this through, as it implies a commitment to keep SD going
*forever* -- something they are really not in a position to do.

It would *great* if someone paid the $3000, put a copy of the PDF on
the open web, and then got a takedown notice.  Almost worth spending
the money just to provoke such a ludicrous scenario!

I'd like to post this information on SV-POW!, as a followup to these posts:

Can you please put me in touch with Dr. Roberts?

Unfortunately I suspect they *have* thought this through and are doing
whatever is possible to restrict the flow of scholarly information unless
they control it.

It is , of course, made much worse because academia, especially the
libraries, has no interest in this problem. (I hope that's a disprovably
false statement but I have seen no evidence).

FWIW I am concentrating on our response to Hargreaves - there is an urgency
and we should not now expect Jenny to have to pull this together. We need a
volunteer to help me and others.

I don't understand. My science is stalled because the publishers prevent
it. Are you suggesting we shouldn't worry about our rights and should go
back to the lab? For me we have to get this problem solved for all time as
fast as possible

I shall be on the call

No, what I was saying is that now it has become so
bad that we talk about the problem even though
we're trying not to. It hasn't been that way
before, something has changed.

For those who don't have the link, a draft response that was started by the

I'll also repost to that list.

I would like to talk about the response to Hargreaves - see
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/03/02/our-protocol-for-text-mining-preamble-and-%E2%80%9Cinstitutionalism%E2%80%9D-elsevier-and-other-publishers-should-take-note/This
is urgent and important and Jenny was going to field it but now we
need extra help for the effort.

There's nothing new here unfortunately. Standard practice. Note that they don't actually answer either of the two direct questions. To which the answers are no and no. They do a different deal with the Wellcome who require more freedom to re-use but they don't provide that to anyone else. Interestingly they charge the same amount to Wellcome as to everyone else as well...

Cheers

I agree. The number of people angry with publishers  though fairly small is
risingly rapidly. 10 years ago publishers had our trust and most people
didn't think about the issues. Now the publishers have lost our trust. It
takes 10 years for a company (e.g. Microsoft) to recover lost trust. I
don't think publishers have got that time.

There's nothing *surprising* here.  But for many people (including me)
the actual information is new: I certainly couldn't find anything like
this on Elsevier's site.  Which is why I think it's important to
publish it elsewhere (in this case on SV-POW!).

Well, they do.  Roberts is instructed to sign the usual copyright
transfer form, so evidently Elsevier keep copyright; and "freely
available to all on Science Direct only" answers the question about
"is the file allowed to be hosted anywhere else".

> They do a different deal with the Wellcome who require more freedom to re-use but they don't provide that to anyone else. Interestingly they charge the same amount to Wellcome as to everyone else as well...

That IS interesting.

Subject: [Open-access] Hargreaves Report - urgent call for help with draft
	response
Message-ID: <CABPM+wove01gRLWC-wMTqTp8pf8-R2BrEUsVW4M2avhuhs6EmA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

A while ago, the working group started a response to the Hargreaves Report
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview
This report could lead to substantial changes to UK copyright law,
particularly with regard to text mining of the scientific literature and we
feel that a response is both necessary and urgent.

You can contribute to the draft response here http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-
hargreaves and we would be grateful for any and all input, particularly any
data and hard figures as well as personal experience surrounding access to
the literature for text mining or the possible contribution that text
mining could make to scientific discovery and the economy.

If you wish to discuss points in detail, you can use either this email
thread copying both open-science and open-access, make notes within the
text on the Etherpad or in the chat window on the right of the pad.

Thank you very much in advance for your help!

Jenny

The person soliciting the answer is rather queasy
about publishing it, as the footer contained all
kinds of copyright and confidentiality clauses.

I'll see what he says and will get back to you.

Thanks Diane!

So we need to have something together by 21 March, but essentially as soon
as possible. Peter Murray-Rust is currently collating publisher policies to
text mining for the response so may have a better idea what time scale
would be reasonable to try and collect all our material.

I really want to help on this, but I am totally out of time all next
week. If we have until the 21st though, I will get on it after that.

My timescale is roughly (I would appreciate help on some areas)
* draft a set of principles and protocol before the weekend. (Elsevier have
asked me for a telcom to discuss my textmining requirements. I replied that
my requirements were the same as everyone else's and that I would make the
results of the conversation Open. I offered them 2200 today but I suspect
that's too early. So I'll have a base by Sunday.
* Mail all the reps of publishers by Sunday evening announcing what we are
doing and inviting comments. Invite them to join the list. NOTE: This is
NOT a negotiation. This is a clarification or our rights and a request to
the publishers to agree them or to publicly disagree. I am NOT giving up
any territory.
* announce that we want their comments by <date>. My guess is that
2012-03-14 is a good date. If they are well-intentioned they can easily
answer YES. If they huff and pff then they aren't trying. After all they
set the conditions and they can remove them

* in parallel draft our submission
* collate the responses into the submission.

NOTE: The submissions will be further edited by Ben Hawes at IPO. He is
required to be objective. The intention is that the responses will be read
by the public and also by legislators. The legislators can change many
things without legislation. Legislation is heavier and will take a long
time but may be necessary.

NOTE: It is Europe who imposes NC on textmining. Nonetheless it is worth
making the cases for CC-BY

NOTE: I am meeting Neelie Kroes (Digital Economy, Europe) next month, I hope

Yes that would be great if we start working on Open Hand Book of Research
Data. I would like to be part of the team. Science commons is working on
open access to scientific data.

Thanks Chris - I share many of your concerns.

The unfortunate thing is that many people use terms in fuzzy or casual
manner (and some, I believe, deliberately misuse them for marketing
purposes (e.g. "fully open" meaning "visible" without rights). That is why
the OKD is so important.

In the Open Access community Peter Suber and Stevan Harnad have defined
"libre" as "the removal of some permission barriers". I think this is
highly regrettable and we ran into this problem on  the OKF open-access
list. I believed (wrongly) that libre was well-defined - it isn't. The
removal of just one small barrier means that the mainstream "Open Access"
community will call an artefact "libre". For example allowing someone to
put their article into a repository named by a publisher could be described
as libre.

For that reason we feel that "libre" has been devalued. The only useful
definition in OA are the BBB defintions of which BOAI is the commonest
used. Thus while I would like to use "libre" I am forced to say
"BOAI-compliant".

Although "libre" is clear in software terms I suspect the muddiness of use
in "Open Access" - itself now a virtually meaningless term - will spread to
other information artefacts.

If you use a term, PLEASE, PLEASE provide a definition as nothing is
logical.

The disappearing virtual library

The shutdown of library.nu is creating a virtual showdown between
would-be learners and the publishing industry.

Last Modified: 01 Mar 2012 10:58

Los Angeles, CA - Last week a website called "library.nu" disappeared.
A coalition of international scholarly publishers accused the site of
piracy and convinced a judge in Munich to shut it down. Library.nu
(formerly Gigapedia) had offered, if the reports are to be believed,
between 400,000 and a million digital books for free.

And not just any books - not romance novels or the latest best-sellers
- but scholarly books: textbooks, secondary treatises, obscure
monographs, biographical analyses, technical manuals, collections of
cutting-edge research in engineering, mathematics, biology, social
science and humanities.

The texts ranged from so-called "orphan works" (out-of-print, but
still copyrighted) to recent issues; from poorly scanned to expertly
ripped; from English to German to French to Spanish to Russian, with
the occasional Japanese or Chinese text. It was a remarkable effort of
collective connoisseurship. Even the pornography was scholarly:
guidebooks and scholarly books about the pornography industry. For a
criminal underground site to be mercifully free of pornography must
alone count as a triumph of civilisation.

To the publishing industry, this event was a victory in the campaign
to bring the unruly internet under some much-needed discipline. To
many other people - namely the users of the site - it was met with
anger, sadness and fatalism. But who were these sad criminals, these
barbarians at the gates ready to bring our information economy to its
knees?

They are students and scholars, from every corner of the planet.

Pirating to learn

"The world, it should not come as a surprise, is filled with people
who want desperately to learn."

The world, it should not come as a surprise, is filled with people who
want desperately to learn. This is what our world should be filled
with. This is what scholars work hard to create: a world of reading,
learning, thinking and scholarship. The users of library.nu were
would-be scholars: those in the outer atmosphere of learning who
wanted to know, argue, dispute, experiment and write just as those in
the universities do.

Maybe they were students once, but went on to find jobs and found
families. We made them in some cases - we gave them a four-year taste
of the life of the mind before sending them on their way with
unsupportable loans. In other cases, they made themselves, by hook or
by crook.

So what does the shutdown of library.nu mean? The publishers think it
is a great success in the war on piracy; that it will lead to more
revenue and more control over who buys what, if not who reads what.
The pirates - the people who create and run such sites - think that
shutting down library.nu will only lead to a thousand more sites,
stronger and better than before.

But both are missing the point: the global demand for learning and
scholarship is not being met by the contemporary publishing industry.
It cannot be, not with the current business models and the prices. The
users of library.nu - these barbarians at the gate of the publishing
industry and the university - are legion.

They live all over the world, but especially in Latin and South
America, in China, in Eastern Europe, in Africa and in India. It's
hard to get accurate numbers, but any perusal of the tweets mentioning
library.nu or the comments on blog posts about it reveal that the main
users of the site are the global middle class. They are not the truly
poor, they are not slum-denizens or rural poor - but nonetheless they
do not have much money. They are the real 99 per cent (as compared to
the Euro-American 1 per cent).

They may be scientists or scholars themselves: some work in schools,
universities or corporations, others are doubly outside of the elite
learned class - jobholders whose desire to learn is and will only ever
be an avocation. They are a global market engaged in what we in the
elite institutions of the world are otherwise telling them to do all
the time: educate yourself; become scholars and thinkers; read and
think for yourselves; bring civilisation, development and modernity to
your people.

Sharing is caring

Library.nu was making that learning possible where publishers have
not. It made a good show of being a "book review" site - it was called
library.nu after all, and not "bookstore.nu". It was not cluttered
with advertisements, nor did it "suggest" other books constantly. It
gave straight answers to straightforward searches, and provided user
reviews of the 400,000 or more books in the database.

It was only the fact that library.nu included a link to another site
("sharehosting" sites like ifile.it, megaupload.com, or mediafire.com)
containing the complete version of a digital text that brought
library.nu into the realm of what passes for crime these days.

But the legality of library.nu is also not the issue: trading in
scanned, leaked or even properly purchased versions of digital books
is thoroughly illegal. This is so much the case that it can't be long
before reading a book - making an unauthorised copy in your brain - is
also made illegal.

But library.nu shared books; it did not sell them. If it made any
money, it was not from the texts themselves, but from advertising
revenue. As with Napster in 1999, library.nu was facilitating
discovery: the ability to search deeper and deeper into the musical or
scholarly tastes fellow humans and to discover their connections that
no recommendation algorithm will ever be able to make. In their effort
to control this market, publishers alongside the movie and music
industry have been effectively criminalising sharing, learning and
creating - not stealing.

Users of library.nu did not have to upload texts to the site in order
to use it, but they were rewarded if they did. There were formal rules
(and informal ones, to be sure), concerning how one might "level up"
in the library.nu community. The site developed as websites do, adding
features here and there, and obviously expanding its infrastructure as
necessary. The administrators of the site maintained absolute control
over who could participate and who could not - no doubt in order to
protect the site from skulking FBI agents and enthusiastic newbies
alike.

Even a casual observer could have seen that the frequent changes to
the site were the effects of the cat-and-mouse game underway as law
authorities and publishers sought to understand and eventually seek
legal action against this community. In the end, it was only by
donating to the site that law authorities discovered the real people
behind the site - pirates too have PayPal accounts.

Shutting down learning

The winter of 2012 has seen a series of assaults on file-sharing sites
in the wake of the failed SOPA and PIPA legislation. Mega-upload.com
(the brainchild of eccentric master pirate Kim Dotcom - he legally
changed his name in 2005) was seized by the US Department of Justice;
torrent site btjunkie.com voluntarily closed down for fear of
litigation.

In the last few days before they closed for good, library.nu winked in
and out of existence, finally (and ironically), displayed a page
saying "this domain has been revoked by .nu domain" (the island nation
of Niue). It prominently displays a link to a book (on Amazon!) called
Blue Latitudes, about the voyage of Captain Cook. A story about that
other kind of pirate branches off here.

So what does the shutdown of library.nu mean? One thing it means is
that these barbarians - these pirates who are also scholars - are
angry. We scholars have long been singing the praises of education,
learning, mutual aid and the virtues of getting a good degree. We
scholars have been telling the world of desperate learners to do just
what they are doing, if not in so many terms.

So there are a lot of angry young middle-class learners in the world
this month. Some are existentially angry about the injustice of this
system, some are pragmatically angry they must now spend $100 - if
they even have that much - on a textbook instead of on themselves or
their friends.

All of them are angry that what looked to everyone like the new
horizon of learning - and the promise of the vaunted new digital
economy - has just disappeared behind the dark eclipse of a Munich
judge's cease and desist order.

Writers and scholars in Europe and the US are complicit in the
shutdown. The publishing companies are protecting themselves and their
profits, but they do so with the assent, if not the active support, of
those who still depend on them. They are protecting us - we scholars -
or so they say. These barbarians - these desperate learners - are
stealing our property and should be made to pay for it.

Profiteering

In reality, however, the scholarly publishing industry has entered a
phase like the one the pharmaceutical industry entered in the 1990s,
when life-saving AIDS medicines were deliberately restricted to
protect the interests of pharmaceutical companies' patents and
profits.

The comparison is perhaps inflammatory; after all, scholarly
monographs are life-saving in only the most distant and abstract
sense, but the situation is - legally speaking - nearly identical.
Library.nu is not unlike those clever - and also illegal - local
corporations in India and Africa who created generic versions of AIDS
medicines.

Why doesn't the publishing industry want these consumers? For one
thing, the US and European book-buying libraries have been willing pay
the prices necessary to keep the industry happy - and not just happy,
in many cases obscenely profitable.

Rather than provide our work at cheap enough prices that anyone in the
world might purchase, they have taken the opposite route - making the
prices higher and higher until only very rich institutions can afford
them. Scholarly publishers have made the trade-off between offering a
very low price to a very large market or a very high price to a very
small market.

But here is the rub: books and their scholars are the losers in this
trade-off - especially cutting edge research from the best
institutions in the world. The publishing industry we have today
cannot - or will not - deliver our books to this enormous global
market of people who desperately want to read them.

Instead, they print a handful of copies - less than 100, often - and
sell them to libraries for hundreds of dollars each. When they do
offer digital versions, they are so wrapped up in restrictions and
encumbrances and licencing terms as to make using them supremely
frustrating.

To make matters worse, our university libraries can no longer afford
to buy these books and journals; and our few bookstores are no longer
willing to carry them. So the result is that most of our best
scholarship is being shot into some publisher's black hole where it
will never escape. That is, until library.nu and its successors make
it available.

What these sites represent most clearly is a viable route towards
education and learning for vast numbers of people around the world.
The question it raises is: on which side of this battle do European
and American scholars want to be?

Any evidence for this? I think Berlin is the most important definition.

This is a very useful discussion. I am some others are particularly
concerned with scholarly publication and so i'll move that discussion to
the open-access list

Unfortunately that is not true in the "Open Access" scholarly publishing
world where "open" can mean almost anything and where "libre" also has many
meanings. The usage is laid out by Peter Suber [copied, and on OKF advisory
board] at:
http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/442-guid.html

*

Some observations [from Peter Suber]:
*
*

   - In April 2008, Stevan Harnad and I proposed some terms to describe two
   kinds of free online access:  the kind which removes price barriers alone
   and the kind which removes price barriers and at least some permission
   barriers as well.  The distinction is fundamental and widely-recognized,
   but we saw right away that our terms (weak OA and strong
OA<http://www.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/fos/2008/04/strong-and-weak-oa.html>)
   were ill-chosen and we stopped using them.  However, all of us who work for
   OA and talk about OA still need vocabulary to describe this basic
   distinction.  The most neutral and descriptive terms I've been able to find
   so far are "gratis OA" and "libre OA", and I've decided use them myself
   until I find better ones.  This choice of terms is personal and
   provisional.  But to make it more effective, I wanted to explain it in
   public.
   - "Gratis" and "libre" may not be familiar terms in the domain of
   scholarly communication and OA.  But in the neighboring domain of free and
   open source software, they exactly express the
distinction<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_Libre>I have in
 mind.
   - [...]  The gratis/libre distinction is about user rights or freedoms.
   - [...]
   - Libre OA includes or presupposes gratis OA.  [...]
   - Because there are many different permission barriers to remove, there
   many different degrees or kinds of libre OA.  Gratis OA is just one thing,
   but libre OA is a range of things.
   - The BBB <http://www.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/fos/overview.htm#definition>definition
describes one kind or subset of libre OA.  But not all libre OA
   is BBB OA.
   - I'm  not proposing a change in the BBB definition, and I haven't
   retreated an inch in my support for it.  I'm simply proposing vocabulary to
   help us talk unambiguously about two species of free online access.

This blog post is just a sketch.  For more detail, see the full SOAN
article<http://www.earlham.edu/%7Epeters/fos/newsletter/08-02-08.htm#gratis-libre>.

*
*


*PMR: The problem for me is that OA-libre has an indefinitely large range
of meanings. The removal of a single "permission barrier" can lead to
libre. It is possible that libre grants no additional rights to the reader
(it could be the permission for a library to make a copy for archival, for
example).

I find this regrettable. The chance of converting the OA community to use
"libre" in its software sense is small. I have spent years trying to make
this point. The OA community generally is not interested in discussing
licences and words are used for their advocacy and political role. This
leads to publishers using terms such as "fully open access" to refer to
articles where the reader has no explicit rights other than to read them.

For that reason I have been suggesting "BOAI-compliant OA" or similar. I'm
happy to use BBB if people thing that's better. In the OA world  hundreds
of millions of academic dollars are spent putting material in repositories
without clear terms of re-use. Where there are licences the vast majority
are CC-NC or worse. 95% of "hybrid Gold OA" articles, with large authorside
fees (1000-5000 USD), are not BBB-compliant.

Here's a new journal from two days ago "Chemistry Open":
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1002/%28ISSN%292191-1363/ It uses
CC-NC, costs the author 2500 USD to publish and requires transfer of
copyright to Wiley

http://media.wiley.com/assets/1540/98/ctavchglobal.pdf

Other restrictions are that every copy must point to the Wiley journal,
that the author may not distribute their submitted version except to
"colleagues" and much more.

Klaus, please do not read further - it will damage your health

Press release



The Hague, February 29, 2012


A new service for Open Access Monographs: the Directory of Open Access
Books.



OAPEN is pleased to announce a new service for Open Access monographs: the
Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB). DOAB will provide a searchable index
to peer-reviewed monographs and edited volumes published under an Open
Access business model, with links to the full texts of the publications at
the publisher?s website or repository. The beta version of the service will
contain publications of a selected number of academic publishers. The beta
version will be made public early spring 2012.



The primary aim of DOAB is to increase discoverability of Open Access
books. Academic publishers will be invited to provide the metadata of their
Open Access books to the DOAB. Metadata will be harvestable in order to
maximize dissemination, visibility and impact. Aggregators can integrate
the records in their commercial services and libraries can integrate the
directory into their online catalogues, thereby helping scholars, students
and the general public to discover the books. The directory will be open to
all academic publishers and should contain as many books as possible,
provided that these books are peer reviewed and published in Open Access.
DOAB will determine requirements for publishers to qualify as Open Access
academic book publishers and will maintain a certification procedure.



A number of academic publishers have already expressed their interest in
taking part in the further development of the service; among them are
members of the OAPEN Library such as Amsterdam University Press and
G?ttingen University Press, and other well-known Open Access publishers
such as Open Book Publishers, Open Humanities Press, MPublishing and
Athabasca University Press. OpenEdition, a portal dedicated to electronic
resources in the humanities (www.openedition.org), will also take part in
the beta phase of DOAB.



DOAB will be launched by the OAPEN Foundation <http://www.oapen.org/home>.
The idea for DOAB has been developed with Lars Bj?rnshauge and Salam Baker
Shanawa (director of SemperTool <http://www.sempertool.dk/>), who were also
responsible for the development of the Directory of Open Access Journals (
DOAJ <http://www.doaj.org/>). Both will be involved in the further
development of DOAB.



OAPEN will manage the service and approach publishers to provide the
metadata of their Open Access books. OAPEN (Open Access Publishing in
European Networks, www.oapen.org) started in 2008 as an EU-funded project
coordinated by Amsterdam University Press. The OAPEN Foundation is an
international initiative dedicated to Open Access monograph publishing,
based at the National Library in The Hague. OAPEN develops Open Access
models for books and works with academic publishers and research institutes
to build a collection of Open Access books through the OAPEN Library. OAPEN
is currently involved in two pilot projects in the Netherlands and the UK
experimenting with Open Access monograph publishing.



SemperTool will develop and maintain the service. SemperTool (
www.sempertool.dk) is a software development company specializing in
building digital library technologies, as well as providing hosting and
consulting services. Salam Baker Shanawa, director of SemperTool, was in
charge of development of DOAJ while employed at Lund University, and for
the past two years SemperTool has been responsible for further development
and maintenance of DOAJ.  SemperTool offers a range of reliable and
cost-effective software solutions for digital libraries, and serves more
than 100 universities in Europe, Africa and the Middle East.



Lars Bj?rnshauge will be involved in the further development of DOAB and
its business model. Lars founded and managed DOAJ during his service as
Director of Libraries at Lund University, Sweden. Currently Lars is SPARC?s
Director of European Library relations and Senior Advisor to the National
Library of Sweden.

Dear All,

I agree with Peter that writing the Open Research Data Handbook is not an easy task. Not only is this a complex issue but also a moving target, that would require regular update.

I also agree with Carolina and Sridhar that writing this handbook might be useful, and should include experts from different research areas.

However I think before we continue we should discuss the scope, target group of the handbook. We should also look what is already out there to avoid re-inventing the wheel and make sure we strengthen existing initiatives.

I am willing to help coordinate this effort if we did it, but I am not en expert in open science / open research so I guess the handbook would need someone else to take a lead.

What do people think?

Daniel

From pm286 at cam.ac.uk  Mon Mar  5 08:51:15 2012

Subject: [Open-access] Letter to publishers - URGENT
Message-ID: <CAD2k14NJdynnKK5JEQY8E8q6+sxhfJDCtODCY3hPPcx3iyc8Jw@mail.gmail.com>

I'd like to get a letter from this group to 8 publishers, hopefully by end
of today. The letter will be based on
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/03/04/information-mining-and-hargreaves-i-set-out-the-absolute-rights-for-readers-non-negotiable/
where I set out our demands for our rights. These are not negotiable.

I originally wrote

*I want to extract as many facts as I can from the scientific literature
and publish them (as CC0) for me and others to do science with, to build
new scientific tools and improve the quality of science.

I would suggest rewording this to

*
*We assert that subscribers [1] have an absolute right to use machines to
extract facts [2] from the scholarly literature in all forms [3]  in
arbitrarily large amounts [4] whenever they wish [5] and publish the output
as CC0 [6]. This right extends to creating CC0 indexes [7] and summaries
[8]. Publishers have a responsibility to make this process simple and
reliable for all subscribers [9].
*
*
We will then ask the publishers to agree to this and publish whether they
do. There are only three responses:
A. Agree
B. Refuse to agree
C Fail to reply

To guard against C I have prepared a list of people who I know personally
and who I will either assume have the ability to reply or know where in the
organization. This should take care of non-repudiation. The only person I
don't know is in Science/AAAS.

**We shall point them to the Hargreaves review, the IPO call for
submissions. We shall advise them of my blog and this list and indicate
that they are welcome to take part in discourse where they will be treated
courteously.

Please comment on the wording and add supporting material. All discussions
including those with publishers will be made publicly visible

Notes:
1. A subscription to a paper artefact allows the reader to extract facts,
create indexes and makes summaries without requiring permission. We are
asking for this right for legitimate subscribers to electronic journals and
other scholarly artifacts.
2. Facts are not copyright.
3. **Scholarship expresses facts [at least] as text, numbers, tables,
diagrams, images, spoken discourse and video. Machines can reliably extract
facts from all of these*
4. Limitations on volume are unacceptable, just as they are for human
extracters. The parties have a duty to make sure that robots perform in a
friendly manner
5. Scholars should be able to extract information as soon as it appears and
to delve backwards as far as they wish. They should not be dependent on
publishers providing dumps, though this may be a useful additional option.
6. CC0 means that the information can be freely used with no restrictions.
7. There is a traditional right to index the literature. Many indexes are
factual, others involve judgment/classification which can now be provided
by machines
8. There is a traditional right to create summaries of works and publish
them.
9. No publisher should install robots to block legitimate use by
subscribers. No publisher should insert clauses in contracts which militate
against the subscribers' rights. No publisher should require individuals to
ask for permissions or justify their actions.

Subject: [Open-access] Discussions with Elsevier on information-mining
Message-ID: <CAD2k14PARtq1p-V9U84OGC-yffq5JedPBSLMEqgtUHfPhv9m+w@mail.gmail.com>

I have been contacted by Alicia Wise of Elsevier about their refusal to
allow me unrestricted mining of the content in Elsevier journals. I
reproduce the correspondence as I believe it is in the public interest and
sprang from a public conversation at the Oxford meeting. I'd be grateful
for rapid comments from this list. My response to Elsevier is clear:

   - non-negotiable rights
   - report Elsevier's stated position to Hargreaves


My reply to Alicia Wise / Elsevier

PMR: I have copied in colleagues who were present at our conversation on
Wednesday

My understanding from our conversation is that you agree (or do not
disagree) that I have a right to mine scientific content in journals. I
believe that the situation is actually quite simple and have described it
in my blog

http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/03/04/information-mining-and-hargreaves-i-set-out-the-absolute-rights-for-readers-non-negotiable/


>

>

I am not clear why I am needed in this teleconference. The two actions that
Elsevier need to carry out are:

   - remove the current contractual restrictions in the Cambridge contract
   - remove or reconfigure the Elsevier robots so that journalmining is a
   legitimate activity


I am not the legal representative of the University and cannot sign an
amended contract. I am also not knowledgeable about how Elsevier robots
prevent academics  carrying out mining.

I have no specific project. I have stated my requirements very simply

   - to extract facts from the journal literature to which Cambridge
   subscribes as frequently as I wish or need and in whatever scale I need
   without requiring any explicit need to seek permission. To publish as many
   results as I wish on the open web under a CC0 licence, consistent with the
   Panton Principles for Open Scientific Data

I do not wish this to be a PMR-specific activity - I wish it for all
scientists in all Universities who subscribe to Elsevier journals. I do not
accept that individuals should be required to seek individual permission.
How the technical details are solved is irrelevant to me.

I shall report the progress made in our submission to the Hargreaves report
by March 21.

I hope this is clear - please let me know if it is not.

I see no need to speak, but if it helps resolve this issue for the world
once and for all am happy to devote time to it and set up teleconferences.
However I have wasted weeks with Elsevier up to now and I have no desire to
spend time talking without the certainty of attaining the scholarly rights
I have indicated.

I shall treat our correspondence as public now and in the future.

That all looks good to me.  Only one nit to pick: the statement "facts
are not copyright" is an apples-to-elephants comparison.  We should
say something like "facts are not SUBJECT TO copyright".

No doubt many of the replies you receive will attempt to finesse the
issue by saying things that (they feel) fall short of an actual "no",
such as "we except that the amount should be limited".  We should not
ignore such detail, but clearly we mustn't allow it to blur the clear
picture that we want to present.  So my suggestion is that we present
the results of this survey as a list of YES and NO in bold; but then
include an annex with the detailed statements.

Finally, I don't know which publishers you plan to contact, but please
be sure to include some YESses, such as PLoS, as well as the Elseviers
and Springers.  Otherwise if we end up with a document that is just
NO, NO, NO all the way down, we risk making it seem as though the
publishing industry has a united front supporting a reasonable
position, and we are unreasonable for wanting/expecting it to be
different.  Instead, we want to draw lines between the publishers that
co-operate and those that don't.

Yes. I intend the following 10
PLoS, BMC, Science (contact needed), Nature, Wiley, Elsevier, Springer, STM
Publishers assoc, Roy Soc Chem, Am Chem Soc.

The latter two are representative of "pure society" publishers.

Agree this looks good and is a strong approach. You might also want to ask Rebecca Lawrence at F1000 and also Mark Hahnel at Figshare for "new" publishers.

I don't know if this is useful but I threw this together in another context. It was intended as a quick draft "principles for research data mining"

* Always link back to the version of record of the research output you have mined.
* Include elements and snippets by reference, not by value. Restrict content replication to that reasonably allowed by Fair Use provisions or enabled by licences, and required for efficient services
* Only redistribute content where copyright terms explicitly allow it
* Deposit results in a public database or provide a public service API under appropriate terms for other researchers to use and benefit
* Respect API service limits where posted and develop polite tooling with exponential back-off where appropriate
* When providing a commercial service that depends on other's data or services, expect to pay a reasonable charge for service levels agreements and reasonable expenses

In case its not clear this was focussed on content issues not on data, but something explicit could be added saying "data is not content". Perhaps the "include elements and snippets?" section needs a bit of work as well in this context

Cheers

Cameron

this part

might be changed into sth like

-->
I do not accept that individuals should be required to seek individual permission. This is indeed relevant to all scientists in all Universities who subscribe to Elsevier journals and to the public.

Solving the technical details is a job that is already being paid for by your subscribers.

Also agreed, and another potential "new" publisher might be brian hole

Your footnotes make your actual intention clear, but when I first read
this sentence I thought "this sounds like a recipe for crashing
servers;" or at least that's one possible interpretation for the
"absolute right" to extract as "large amounts" of information
"whenever."

I think you could address this potential criticism by deleting the
word "absolute" [very few rights are indeed so, sigh] and inserting an
additional footnote after the word "right" that makes clear that you
of course intend that you (and everyone else exercising the right) be
a good internet citizen. Cameron's point about respect[ing] "API
service limits where posted and develop[ing] polite tooling with
exponential back-off where appropriate" could serve as a basis for the
footnote.

The Un*x command that allows users to prioritise kernel time between
different users is called, fittingly, "nice," and I don't think it's
quite good enough to say that the technical details don't concern you
when proposing automated access to servers. After all, you couldn't
abstract a chemistry article that day if it was bound in a volume that
had been borrowed by another user.

The current tone of your draft betrays the frustration you have
experienced over the past few years, and while that is understandable
to me as a list member here, a more even and temperate tone that
acknowledges some of the potential practical difficulties would
perhaps be more effective. Murmur gently in a voice of sweet reason...

Regards to all,

D.

Agreed -- this small change would make a big difference to the
perceived tone without actually affecting the meaning.

I agree that a note should be inserted to this effect.  But I think
you should avoid trying to integrate (any version of) Cameron's text
detailing what that means.  This is an email about principles, not
implementation, and in this context it suffices to say we intend to
play nice.  (Otherwise we're just inviting the publishers to get into
a lot of irrelevant detail about what they consider a suitable
exponential back-off factor to be.)  We want this to be short, sweet,
instantly comprehensible, and incapable of misinterpretation.

I agree that we can't say technical details don't concern us.  But we
can say that they are not the subject of THIS discussion.  We can
recognise the importance of that separate discussion without getting
sucked into having it now.

Agreed.

There's a paradox there: only years of abuse can give rise to the
level of fury that makes letters like Peter's happen at all; but only
a more sober tone than such fury expresses can achieve all that we
hope.  So it's good that we have among us some people who have not yet
been pissed of quite so royally as Peter.

Oh I have, I have: my disallusion on parting from the BMJ was fairly
complete (when they put up their paywall in 2005), and it's taken the
best part of a decade for me to recover to the point where I am
capable of writing such an email as my response to Peter. But
unfortunately expressing anger and frustration is a losing strategy.

I understand we are discussing general principles, BTW which is why I
used the phrase "good internet citizen" rather than attempting any
lawyerly definition of what it would actually take to ensure that
human users are not inconvenienced by robotic demands on servers
(something that I am not competent to propose in any case).

Regards to all,

D.

Just that I've talked about copyright in content in the text I used and the whole point here is that copyright doesn't apply to data. So where I've put content in that text it might be better to use a different form of words to separate data from "content which is copyrightable"

Cheers

Cameron

I am busy for the next two hours at least.

I suggest that someone takes the draft, hacks it independently of me. I can
provide email addresses. Probably one copy per addressee is polite. It's
OUR draft not my draft and if you think the language needs some moderation
fine.

But no concessions

I am talking with Elsevier at 1700. I shall record it

Maybe back at 1430-1530

For me the strong tone of the message is absolutely OK. Of course we do not
want to be to harsh, but I don't think the letter is. Replacing the
absolute with 'fundamental' would be expressing my conviction on this topic
quite nicely, where 'absolute' has an undertone of frustration, this just
would state matters as a fact.

I humbly offer the following text as a possible revision in the light
of this morning's discussion. I hope it is a helpful contribution to
the drafting process.

Briefly, I have substituted "fundamental" for absolute,  replaced
"arbitrarily large amounts" with "without limitation", and "whenever
they wish" by "entire current" (which means the old footnote 7 becomes
the new note 4), and inserted a footnote [2] on being nice with the
server (thus renumbering successive footnotes).

I am somewhat aghast at my own temerity in so-doing, and will not be
offended in the slightest should anyone decide to hit the revert
button. The new introductory paragraph is entirely my invention and
could and should be improved by others more knowledgeable than I.

Regards to all,

D.

Dear [NamedPersonAtOrganisationX],

As you know, progress in networked computing currently offers
unparalleled opportunities for progress in many areas through the use
of textmining algorithms on the existing scholarly literature.
[[Required: 1 sentence on potential benefit for humanity. . . [Such
techniques could [???speed drug discovery, save scholarly time. . .
thus saving lives and generating economic benefits . . . add here] ]]
We are writing to several major scholarly publishers to ascertain
their current practice in this domain, and plan to collate the replies
we receive as part of our submission to the Hargreaves enquiry.

We assert that subscribers [1] have a fundamental right to use
machines [2] to extract facts [3] from the entire current scholarly
literature [4] in all forms [5] without limitation [6] and publish the
output as CC0 [7]. This right extends to creating CC0 indexes [8] and
summaries [9]. Publishers have a responsibility to make this process
simple and reliable for all subscribers [10].

We would appreciate a clear statement of your support for this
important scholarly principle, and for specific details of how
[OrganisationName] is furthering scientific progress in this
endeavour.

You are also cordially invited to join in the discussion of these
issues on the mailing lists and blogs of the okfn. [[provide URLs
here]]

Thank-you for your response.

Yours sincerely,
[PMR on behalf of . . . ?]

Notes:
1. A subscription to a paper artefact allows the reader to extract
facts, create indexes and makes summaries without requiring
permission. We are asking for this right for legitimate subscribers to
electronic journals and other scholarly artifacts.
2. Subject to best network practice in the prevention of server
overload by intensive automated requests, i.e. in conformance to any
reasonable API service limit.
3. Facts are not copyright.
4. Scholars should be able to extract information as soon as it
appears and to delve backwards as far as they wish. They should not be
dependent on publishers providing dumps, though this may be a useful
additional option.
5. Scholarship expresses facts [at least] as text, numbers, tables,
diagrams, images, spoken discourse and video. Machines can reliably
extract facts from all of these
6. Limitations on volume are unacceptable, just as they are for human
extracters.
7. CC0 (Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication) means that the
information can be freely used with no restrictions (See
http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
8. There is a traditional right to index the literature. Many indexes
are factual, others involve judgment/classification which can now be
provided by machines.
9. There is a traditional right to create summaries of works and publish them.
10. No publisher should install robots to block legitimate use by
subscribers. No publisher should insert clauses in contracts which
militate against the subscribers' rights. No publisher should require
individuals to ask for permissions or justify their actions.

Thanks Douglas,
This is great.

One minor suggestion...

Second para suggest replace "and publish the output as CC0" with "and publish the resulting data output under a Creative Commons Zero waiver"

Cheers

Or indeed just "in the public domain" -- the use of CC0 in particular
seems like unnecessary detail.  And we know that at least some
publishers COMPLETELY misunderstand what Creative Commons is -- see

Elsevier has replied and the instructions I posted in the
original email of this thread can be made public.

In the thread on G+ there is also a reply from Alicia Wise
on which he is not sure, yet.

This worries me greatly. Read it. It effectively acknowledges Elsevier's
right to control what Universities can and cannot do. I have spent a
fruitless few days being pushed around by Elsevier and I know the signs all
too well.

Libraries have signed away our rights because they didn't value them. One
of the great disasters of modern scholarship. Now they are trying to get
them back.

Effectively:
Elsevier: "our contract states that we have complete rights to forbid you
to do anything other than humanly read our material"
Librarians: "OK." (Maybe because they got a Big Deal in return.
Scientists: "We have a right to mine the literature"
Elsevier: "OK you can have bits of it as long as we control it"

This is similar to HINARI. Publishers forbid the third worlds all access to
scholarship and then give bits of it back. Aren't they generous.

I shall blog it. I am now very depressed. We have ceded yet more rights and
territory.

FWIW Elsevier has offered to let me text mine if I explain my project to
them and they agree and propose a special case for PeterMR because he's had
an unfortunate time with Elsevier.

Hi Peter and others,

I agree that all this is very very frustrating.
Still your action of calling different publishers in public to express
their views on textmining is the right strategy.
In the first place we have to make this knowledge (on the policy for
textmining) as public as possible.
Also, reading several OA policy papers (boring) from the EU  and the Ghent
declaration<http://www.openaire.eu/nl/component/content/article/76-highlights/223-seizing-the-opportunity-for-open-access-to-european-research-ghent-declaration-published>of
the EU that was signed by
 Gregor Hagedorn, Julius K?hn-Institute, BerlinFrederick Friend, University
College London, Jean-Claude Gu?don, Universit? de Montr?al and John
Willinsky, Stanford University it seems to me that we might find a strong
ally in "OpenAire" and Neelie Kroes".
We will need a lot of political pressure to achieve our goals and if we
could get Neelie Kroes at our side it could make a difference.
But perhaps I am naive to think that politics can actually change things ;)
TOM

I have been invited to give a plenary lecture at a summit in Rome where
Neelie Kroes is speaking. I hope I can get time with her

Hi all,

I noticed in the etherpad from the last meeting [1] that there was an
action for me to create a Doodle poll for a logo.

Very happy to create this - but do we have any suggested logos yet? Perhaps
if people could reply to this thread with logo selections, I will create a
poll in a few days time.

Thanks folk!

Probably not. I  am actually mailing all the publishers personally - see
today's blog. I shall include background that is different for each. If
anyone knows anyone in AAAS/Science that would be good.

What we MUST do is to start fleshing out the submission

Hi

I'm just wondering whaat you're trying to achieve here. Your're preparing a submission from representatives on this list. As Peter said in reply to my question on his blog, this is your submission to Hargreaves, its not a negotiation. Publishers will also be putting forward their own nuanced submissions. This group also doesn't include other major text mining experts, so I would also ask that this should be presented as an OKFN or similar submission rather than the agreed text miners' bottom line - so I'm not convinced that I want to reply to this, to have yes/no/unhelpful reflected up to IPO as our views, when we'll be putting in our own submissions.

Best wishes

Richard

Hi, Richard.

The point of Peter's submission is not really to argue for any
specific stance, but just to document what publishers' stances
actually ARE.  It's an attempt to get publishers to be open about what
their policies are -- something that one would think they can hardly
object to -- so that we know where we stand, what further negotiations
might be profitable, and whether other recommendations should be made
elsewhere.

In short: it's a data-gathering exercise, not an argument.

-- Mike.

It bothers me that we only have two candidates (albeit that one of
them is in a five variants).  Do we really have no other options?

I also think that we should have designs from more people to choose from.
We could wait for another week or so to see whether that happens?

Thanks to all the people submitting.

A technical point. It is valuable to have  logos which can be shrunk and
still be recognisable. Lines can disappear on shrinkage. Some organisations
have simplified logos for mini-pngs. SVG doesn't fully solve this problem
as lines can be rendered invisible or overlapping. I think the moire images
will be very confusing when shrunk

Just another point. I have heard rumblings of a suggestion for a new OA logo for BBB-compliant works that would probably be trademarked and subject to serious quality control. I don't know how people feel about how this would combine with @ccess or whether it could be part of the same thing. I can't say much more about this right now because it was just an idea raised on one specific forum but I encouraged it and hope to be able to connect this up sometime RSN if it goes forward. I think @ccess should have its own logo possibly as well but there might be value in coordinating the visuals and therefore holding back a little?

Cheers

Cameron

We've discussed this on the call, and decided to gather a few more logos
before we put them to the vote. Let's keep the suggestions and discussions
open for the next week or so, and think about having a Doodle poll a little
later.

Key considerations seem to be simplicity: we want a logo that easily scales
up and down, is recognisable and not too fussy.

Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMZtbwOo=phQH1nNdAnfGhZ82bKWTuq8Qh6LnDw8WB+BRA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

On the call today it was decided that Tom O. should be the main working
group coordinator of the @ccess group. Tom O. will need a back-up going
forward - this may be Cameron (to be confirmed once Cameron has more idea
of his commitments in approx 1 month), but I'm sure both Tom and Cameron
would appreciate extra volunteers!

As coordinator, Tom O. will set up the Skype calls and have overall
responsibility for keeping an eye on the website. So if you haven't already
done so, now is the time to add Tom O. to your skype contact lists :)

Thanks,
Laura

just FYI...

I believe that whoneedsaccess has those + stories from scientists. One of
the aims of the website is showing that open access is not just for
scientists!

Agreed! I try to use the word "scholarship" which extends to anyone
sufficient interested in a discipline. Their activity may or may not be
formally published and they may or may not be a formal member of a
scholarly institution.

I relied to Amy yesterday, on seeing the tweet, pointer her to Who Needs
Access.  She was pretty impressed, and I think is going to cover it.

 All,

Oxford University have just uploaded a video of the recent public debate
about open science.

http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/evolution-science-open-publishing-video

Open Science <http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/series/open-science>
 In this series of podcasts we consider the impact of opening up science:
allowing both the research community and the public to freely access the
results of scientific work. Individuals can be fully informed about medical
or environmental research, students worldwide can get access to the latest
work, and software agents can roam the vast scientific knowledge base
seeking patterns and correlations that no human has observed. Ultimately,
it may profoundly change the way science is done.


A distinguished group comes together in Oxford's Rhodes House to publicly
debate 'The Scientific Evolution: Open Science and the Future of
Publishing'.



Panelists include Fields Medal winning mathematician Tim Gowers, molecular
biologist and TV personality Lord Robert Winston, and representatives from
publishers Nature and Elsevier. Together they ask "Is there a better way
for scientists to communicate their work?". The event was chaired by
quantum physicist Dr Simon Benjamin, and sponsored by Oxford's Materials
Department.

Hi all,

In the last Skype meeting we decided that we need more input to be able to
choose a logo for @ccess.
I have made a google docs presentation for easy visualisation

Hi Laurence,

You are right that I thought it a very nice picture.
I am well aware that it is copyrighted and in the mail I had included  the
coorresponding notice.
It would be nice if there is a way to be able to use it  ie if the
photographer or copyright holder could give us the rights to use it on our @
ccess.okfn.org site.
Please let me know

thanks

TOM

Hi Mike

But the communication says 

"Unfortunately any other reply than YES by 2012-03-15 will be regarded as unacceptable for the purposes of Hargreaves."

Which is all about a specific stance, isn't it? The only data is whether we agree with a request to mine, yes or no, and is put in the context of showing Hargreaves the benefits of mining. So as an information gathering exercise on policy I'm not sure it'll work.

In other news, there was a CCC meeting on Data and Text Mining in Amsterdam last week, and a draft cross-publisher mining license has been prepared for discussion with the pharma people; there's also a working group on a common text mining format. 

Best wishes

Richard

Well, in the sense that Peter's stance is that he wants assurances
that he is free to mine resources that his institution has paid for
access to, yes, I suppose.  His problem is that for the last three
years, his attempts to ask the yes-or-no question "may I proceed?"
have been repeatedly met with every kind of answer BUT yes or no --
things like "we should set up a conference call to discuss your
needs".  But that's ultimately no good to him -- it won't scale.  So
from his perspective it really is as simple as a binary choice between
"yes" and "other",

And an important point that publishers are mostly not getting (or at
least they talk as if they're not getting it) is that this is how it's
going to be for most would-be miners.  When running into an answer
other than Yes or No, most people are either going to walk away from
the project, or make do with a smaller corpus for which the terms ARE
clear.  And that doesn't benefit ANYONE.

> The only data is whether we agree with a request to mine, yes or no, and is put in the context of showing Hargreaves the benefits of mining. So as an information gathering exercise on policy I'm not sure it'll work.

Well, for gathering the information of whether publishers say "yes" or
something different, it's perfect.  And since that's the only answer
Peter cares about it, it's hardly surprising that it's the question
he's asking.

Our history of getting precise answers out of publishers shows that they
are extremely reluctant to give any definitive answers. For example your
colleague Tony Williams waited for years for an answer from the American
Chemical Society on data in Crystaleye (as did we). We've tried for 2.5
years to get useful replies from Elsevier - we are now finally getting
fragmented statements.

The STM publishers' association stresses how helpful the publishers are to
people wanting to text-mine. There are no contacts listed in any publisher
I know (other than CC-BY publishers where they are not needed). Has the RSC
stated anywhere what is its policy on textmining - what it allows and what
it does not. If you wish to make a proactive statement for the world we'd
be delighted

And the Hargreaves report is, in part, due to publishers not being helpful
and proactive.

In other news, there was a CCC meeting on Data and Text Mining in Amsterdam

Hi all,

As you have seen in the mail I have taken the task of coordinating the
@ccess initiative from now on.

Because I will have to do the conference calls I want you to look at your
Skype contacts and add me
tom.olijhoek at skype to your list of accepted contacts if you haven't done so
already.

*PLEASE CHECK   only in this way can I proceed and make a Skype Group that
I can call for the open-access initiative meetings*

BOAI-Openness and it has to be done paper-by-paper"

I am not sure what PMR had in mind here that "has to be done
paper-by-paper", but albeit PMC / PMUK do indeed a bad job in
identifying papers by their licenses, Google does it fairly well:
216 PMC articles under CC0 are being brought up in search for "malaria"
https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc+%22Creative+Commons+Public+Domain%22
as well as over 9000 under CC BY:
https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc+%22http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby%22+-%22by-sa%22++-%22by-nc%22++-%22by-nd%22
(for further stats, see
http://wir.okfn.org/2011/07/14/a-wiki-approach-to-open-access-and-open-science/#comment-44
).

Of course, the relevance of these papers for Malaria World cannot be
established that way.

Google does not give a simple list of results, and it currently yields
over 80k hits for malaria on PMC:
https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc .

However, the Crawler currently being coded as part of the Open Access
Media Importer (cf.
http://wir.okfn.org/2012/03/10/open-access-media-importer-apology-frontend-usage/
) does almost what you are looking for, and so it should not be too
difficult to modify it accordingly.

I have copied Nils and Raphael - my partners on this - into this mail.

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi All,

Do I understand it right that you did a search for just *one keyword
"malaria"*?
PMR says that MW gave >70K references
I thought that Mark extracted >70K references using the *set of
keywords*provided by us (MW)?
This is of no consequence to the observation that google search seems to do
a good job.
We recently had a discussion (Mark, Tom , Bart, Serge [admin MW]) that the
MW ref database of 2010-2011 will be compared to the pmc exracted
references for these years to see how identical the sets are.
That will be the basis for an extraction over a long time period using the
chosen keywords.
When you can use Google to sort the CC-BY and CC-0 it would be fantastic!

TOM

Just to sum up:

Google brings up over 80k hits for malaria on PMC:
https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc ,

of which
216 PMC articles under CC0:
https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc+%22Creative+Commons+Public+Domain%22

as well as over 9000 under CC BY:
https://www.google.com/search?q=malaria+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc+%22http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby%22+-%22by-sa%22++-%22by-nc%22++-%22by-nd%22

I do not know how Mark arrived at the 70k results for the set of
keywords, but the 80k for malaria contain phrases like "diseases like
malaria" (136x, cf.
https://www.google.com/search?q=%22diseases+like+malaria%22+site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc
), which may not always be in the focus of Malaria World.

Peter, Mark and Sam - is the code for your Crawler available
somewhere? Or is there an app that I could use to text mine, say,
arXiv?

The code for our tool is at
https://github.com/erlehmann/open-access-media-importer , an outlie of
documentation at
http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Open_grant_writing/Wissenswert_2011/Documentation/Crawler
.

That looks really good, Daniel, many thanks for organising it.

So far as the posting, I can handle that -- cut, paste, edit, format,
no problem.

We need two things before I do that, though.  First, I need a nice
portrait of Armin that I can use, and ideally one or two other
relevant images though those aren't obligatory.  Second, the answer to
this question is not really satisfactory: "Have you come across some
references that seemed highly relevant but that were inaccessible to
you?"  Although it's great that he found everything he needed for the
Morbus Fabry article in OA articles, we really need to show not only
how access helps but also how LACK of access hinders.  Can you please
get him to tell you a bit about another article he's worked on that
ran into this problem?

Thanks again,
        -- Mike.

I am copying in my OKF colleagues (Open Knowledge Foundation) as we are
also preparing a response to Hargreaves. My recent activities have been to
approach publishers with requests for text-mining. I am publishing their

Yes. I am very conscious that we pay the publishers (through subscriptions)
who then employ staff to prevent us doing things. The publishers make an
apparently persuasive case - "always being helpfule". In fact they aren't
and part of our task is to pull together evidence to show that they have
prevaricated, flannelled, and in some areas are incompetent (not knowing
the difference between copyright and contract - BTW it is the contracts
that current stop me working - the libraries have signed many of our
current rights to the publishers.

This is my weekend's fun - fighting the publishers rather than doing
science.

Message-ID: <CAGyWN8a6nLDdHbAWtMXzmd2brGGj7+XdBgDuaVoSVwi1pTz5Cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

BLOGGING
Please feel free to blog on open access topics on the site access.okfn.org
Douglas Carnal is going to put up a blog on aspects of CC-NC versus CC-BY
licensing because @ccess made the choice for CC-BY and some other open
access initiatives would accept CC-NC as open access too.
of course you can also put in comments..................

TWEETS
At the moment tweets are put up by Mike Taylor and me, but anyone else can
ask for access to the twitter account through Mike.

To be successful we have to make the site as lively as possible

TOM

Hi all,

Daniel Scott is really wanting to make use of @ccess and he runs into
troubles with the Q&A login.
I have seen that more people have looked to ask Questions and have given up.
This should be resolved ASAP
Does any one of you have an idea on how to resolve this??


greetings  TOM

Hi Daniel,

As promised in my prev reply, I have asked the people of OKFN and they seem
to think that you should be able to login. Please go to the site, do not
login to OKFN beforehand, try to post a Question, and when asked login with
your OKFN name and passw.
Let me know if you succeed.
As I have told you the group on LinkedIn has no more than 5 people, I want
to close it down.I would be happy if you will use @ccess for your open

Hi Tom

Thank you for your suggestion. I have registered this evening with the OKFN
and tried to follow your suggestion and leave the 'Reaching Young Academics
and Researchers' discussion on the @ccess site. However, I could not do so.
Do I need to register separately for the @ccess site, or am I doing
something wrong?

Regards
DAN

Hi all,

If you haven't yet heard, this year's Open Knowledge Festival will take
place in Helsinki in September. See: http://okfestival.org/

Plans are currently being developed, and it would be great if we could put
an exciting Open Science and Open Access stream together. We have begun to
outline potential topics and suggest speakers we may wish to invite at
http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest. Please do add your thoughts!

The organising committee have requested that individual streams should have
one or two main contact people, plus a small organising team [see email
below]. I am happy to act as one of the main contact people if you would be
happy with that, and would love a couple of people to join me!

Please let me know if you would like to be involved with the planning at
this stage. To stay in the loop with the organising committee, you can also
join the okfestival-coord mailing list here:
http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/okfestival-coord.

Finally, please do reserve the dates in your diary. We hope that many of
you may be able to join us in Helsinki in September!

All the best,
Laura

To: okfestival-coord at lists.okfn.org



Hello everyone,

About developing the streams further -

Some streams (like Open data in Aid and Development and GLAM) have already
several people involved and some concrete ideas about the format/content of
the stream. Some streams are currently just ideas suggested by someone on
this list.

To get a better overview of the current situation, could you please update
the info about your stream at our Etherpad page:
http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/**helsinki<http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/helsinki>

The format could be something like this:

*# open GLAM / Open Cultural Data
*
short-description-here
Responsible persons (1-2): NNN, ZZZ
People who are willing on be involved in organising this stream: NNN, ZZZ
People interested in this stream: NNN, ZZZ

- - - -

Or alternatively for the streams that are just ideas:

*# name-of-the-stream*
short-description-here
I'm looking for more people to get involved in this - please write your
name + email here, or give a shout on the email list!
Suggested by: NNNN

- - -

It would be great if each stream could nominate 1-2 people to be the main
contact persons, this will make programme planning and various
organisational matters more smooth. And yes, it would be great if each
stream would have one person from Helsinki (or from elsewhere in Finland)
involved.

The programme planning will happen as a dialogue between the organising
committee, advisory board and the groups of people responsible for the
streams. We are currently not sure if we set up a separate programme
planning list, or whether we use this list for the planning discussions.

The OKFest Call for Proposals will be published soon, in the call we will
ask people to give a more concrete suggestion about the format/content of
the stream. When we send out the call we will also give you more
information about the venues we have, and some suggestions of possible
programme formats (we hope that people would suggest some non-traditional
programme formats). Me and other members of the organising team will help
you to make these suggestions, and we can talk about them here.

Best regards,

Juha.

OKfest coordinator / Helsinki

Subject: [Open-access] journal rank manuscript
Message-ID: <148943791.20120320195215@gmail.com>

Dear all,

some of you may remember that I was talking about a
manuscript that Marcus Monafo and I are writing covering the
literature on the effects of journal rank. Well, now it's in
a shape where I wouldn't be too embarrassed to show it to
others, so here you go:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VF_jAcDyxdxqH9QHMJX9g4JH5L4R-9r6VSjc7Gwb8ig/edit

There's still some work to be done, but the main ideas are
in there, as far as we know the literature. Any additional
references, comments or suggestions on presentation or
wording, hell, any feedback at all is deeply appreciated!

Many thanks in advance,

Bjoern

 re-use on an open access repository?
Message-ID: <CACRfEncZ+g2inpo1ij_LyBoMQ-38fhrgKzBk5J5Y7DJKUok9cg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I'm Tariq Khokhar and work at the World Bank in Washington DC. Here in a
personal(ish) capacity.

My question is roughly: is there a good open alternative to things like:
http://www.crossref.org/

In particular, for this scenario:

1) Institution X has an open access repository with research paper P in it.
2) Someone, S, takes P, either re-uses it or cites it in paper or product D
3) S then publishes or puts online D

Question: How can X (semi) automatically discover D and list it alongside P
on the original open access repository? What would S have to do with D in
order to help this along?

Hope that's clear!

Subject: [Open-access] Open Access Understanding lanched in Romania
Message-ID: <CADybtq0Fmknc=7c+NLEcXSx1Uu67dyf_LGiVXCDhA694yUtw4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

The moment has come when all the thoughts, ideas, the initiatives and
the best experiences concerning Open Access to find a streamlined
expression capable to set in motion a vector for actions in Romania.
To this purpose, The Understanding of Open Access has been launched.
It is a document with a double significance: ?understanding? as a
consensual agreement among the signatories and ?understanding? meaning
a good apprehension of the concepts behind it.

What sparked this document?
Kosson community members shown a great interest and involvement for
the valorisation of the electronic information resources in Open
Access regime since 2005. From that moment on, a long path was
followed in translating, studying and promoting the concepts and the
models for the Open Access. In the year 2010, the Romanian Library
Association adopted a Motion on Open Access during the national
conference.
This important moment needed to be elevated in order to project
concrete actions in the future and this led to this programatic and
pragmatic document expressing the will and understanding of the
Romanian stakeholders.

Why it needs your support and where to promote it?
The first answer springs out of the need to clearly state the fact it
is not only necessary to have some knowledge about Open Access, but to
understand what this means. This difference in semantics it is
necessary now more than ever when many things seems to dilute and
apparently are being mangled in many other matters of concern.
Another answer is the need for more clarity in all it has to be done
in the future. To this purpose the document points to concrete
objectives.

What is the purpose of the understanding?
It will lead to a better consolidation of the members actions around
the community goals and offers solid guidelines to the knowledge gains
and further development opportunities.
It offers a clear fixed mark for the future of the Open Access in
Romania and Europe at large.
It constitutes the base for future actions and activities tightly
linked to Open Access advocacy in Romania.
It will be the measure for future calibration of our performances as
the objectives will be counted in solid facts for the Romanian society
and for the world at large.

What can I do?
1. Read, understand and sign the document at http://startad.kosson.ro
2. Advertise and advocate among your fellow colleagues the existence
of this document, what it means and what are the objectives.
3. Discuss among your friends and colleagues about the ways you could
involve your institution in advocating Open Access to information.
4. Acquire deeper and useful knowledge about this paradigm because
your institution will be affected in the future directly or by
influence by the Open Access implementations.
5. Initiate debate, write useful materials and involve all the stuff
working in your institution.
6. Take the document with you and convey its meanings and objectives
further to the management level, and raise the awareness to the final
goal of achieving an Open Access mandate and an institutional
endorsement for the Understanding.

Let us dedicate some time to understand Open Access, together, for our
better knowledge and for those whom we serve.

You are welcome to endorse it as it doesn't fold only to the Romanian realities.

Kind regards,

Hi Tariq

As far as I know, there is currently no open alternative to CrossRef with
good coverage of the literature because the reference lists from papers are
in the main not open data and therefore can't be automatically discovered
and reused, although if D was open access then it might be possible.

There are certain projects looking to address this and make citation
networks of OA material e.g. http://opencitations.net/ and lots of interest
in encouraging publishers to make all of their reference/citation data open
to enable alternative services and novel uses of the data.

I'm copying in the open biblio mailing list who will be able to answer your
question far more authoritatively than I could!

Jenny

Subject: [Open-access] Authors and Institutional Users: Finding a Fair and
 Appropriate Equilibrium in Copyright Law
Message-ID: <4F71B021.10008@qmul.ac.uk>

Thought this list might be interested in this free lecture in London on 
4 Apr in London, 6-8pm. Obviously feel free to forward the link.

http://www.law.qmul.ac.uk/events/items/57312.html

"National and international copyright laws are traditionally premised on 
the notion that this species of law is concerned primarily with 
protecting authors? rights. Upon closer scrutiny, however, one observes 
two glaring contradictions. First, copyright law benefits a far wider 
range of stakeholders than just the author. These include employers, 
producers, corporations, publishers and collective management 
organisations. The theoretical position is that the ?author? is best off 
by being represented and remunerated by one of these institutional 
stakeholders. However, the practical position is that the author is 
surprisingly ill-served under copyright law, as she struggles to retain 
both acknowledgement and remuneration. Secondly, it is often forgotten 
that copyright law?s overriding purpose is to support creativity not 
solely out of a moral obligation to do so but as a way to benefit 
society as a whole. It follows from this that copyright law has a public 
policy obligation to protect the rights and duties of public cultural 
institutions which promote the ?conservation, development and diffusion 
of science and culture.

Drawing on the lessons of the recent ?orphan works? debate, and 
employing intellectual property and human rights laws, this lecture 
argues that we urgently need to clarify our view of what copyright law 
is for in order to counter the current discrimination, and instead 
achieve a more fair and appropriate equilibrium which recognises the 
interests of authors, public cultural institutions and the general public."

This looks very useful. We are  thinking along the same lines on
open-biblio so I have copied them.

states
"
- The PMC OAI service and the PMC FTP service are the _only_ services
that may be used for automated downloading of articles from this open
access subset.
- Systematic retrieval (bulk downloading) of articles through any
other automated process is prohibited, even if you are only retrieving
articles from this subset.
- Some journals use the label "open access" for an article that is
available free at time of publication, but is still subject to
traditional copyright restrictions. Such articles are not part of this
subset."

We follow their download instructions, so we are on the safe side.

well, actually publishers are birds of many feathers,
I would like to caution against othering "them" into one and the same (closed) pot :-)
better don't glue them together as birds of only one feather,

The problem is, in the absence of explicit machine-readable statements
from each publisher about reuse rights of each journal or even each
article, the only safe course is to assume the worst, and not use what
you don't KNOW you can use.

For publishers that want to be The Good Guys, and want their articles
to be part of mining initiatives, the onus is on them to find good,
clear ways to communicate what rights are available.  This is probably
a good place to start:

Subject: [Open-access] OKFest - Call for Proposals
Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMYbf9sN6X0oWzBdp9jZ6W7nJdibP_+pyT_Nk9m1RW9z=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

As many of you may have spotted, the Call for Proposals for OKFest was
officially launched today! You can read's Kat's blog post here:

http://blog.okfn.org/2012/03/28/okfestival-call-for-proposals-released-with-a-twist/

We should definitely propose an Open Science stream. The deadline for
proposals is 20th April. You can see the format our proposal will need to
take here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGY5bTNkT05wd2ZkUS1EZktJVFE4UGc6MQ

The etherpad we began planning on is actually looking pretty healthy. Many
thanks to everyone who has contributed already. It would be great to get as
many ideas down there as possible before we submit the proposal though, so
do take a minute to have another look. In particular, they are keen for
sessions to take place in various formats, not just the traditional talk /
panel. We've had a couple of ideas for hands on drafting and tool-testing
sessions, but do keep thinking and suggesting! The etherpad is here:

http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

I have rearranged the original text to fit the form for the OKFest Call for
Proposals. Please add, comment and edit away!

I have included the formal text for the Call for Proposals below this email.

Thanks everyone!
Laura



OPEN KNOWLEDGE FESTIVAL - CALL FOR PROPOSALS*

First Round Deadline: April 20th 2012
Second Round Deadline: June 1st 2012

*OPEN KNOWLEDGE FESTIVAL*

We are delighted to announce that this year?s Open Government Data Camp and
Open Knowledge Conference are joining to form a week-long celebration: the
*Open Knowledge Festival*!

This pioneering event will include an action-packed week of lectures,
seminars, workshops, hackathons, coding jams, and interactive sessions that
will bring together individuals and organizations from a wide variety of
backgrounds to exchange ideas, make things and meet new people. OKFest will
also highlight the diversity of Finland?s open knowledge communities to a
new international audience, with a specific effort to encourage the
participation of representatives from Nordic nations.

Join us in Helsinki, Finland on 17-22 of September 2012 for a week of open
knowledge and global inspiration.

*THEME: OPEN KNOWLEDGE IN ACTION*

The 2012 theme of OKFestival is *Open Knowledge in Action*. We will focus
on the /value/that can be generated by opening up knowledge, the ecosystems
of organisations that benefit from and participate in sharing, and the
impact that open knowledge can have in our societies. What kinds of new
professions, ideas and community initiatives can emerge within our
governments, markets, networks and neighbourhoods as a result of these
engagements?

The exploration of this theme will not only be visible in the festival?s
content, but also in its implementation as the first global event of its
kind. At OKFestival, we will experiment with new forms of collaboration,
new workshop formats and new forms of participation. We?ll bring together
civil society representatives, programmers, data wranglers, designers,
students, members of government and local communities for a week of
building new things and sharing great ideas.

*CALL FOR PROPOSALS*

We have *two submission deadlines*this Spring based on our venue capacity
at the *Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture*in
Helsinki. We suggest applying as soon as possible in order to ensure
adequate venue space, support and funding for your proposals.

First Round Deadline: April 20th 2012
Second Round Deadline: June 1st 2012

We are looking for proposals related to specific open knowledge and open
data topics, but also new viewpoints and cross-cutting issues which may
help us to understand how open knowledge is working in our society.
Examples of such topics are the well-being of communities, civil society
and citizen empowerment, democracy, entrepreneurship, smart cities,
sustainability etc.

Hi  Jenny ,

I saw you missed the call because I wrote 10.00 UTC and the time here in
the Netherlands changed to summer time =+ 1 hour.
nobody complained that I called them apparently at 9.00 UTC??
sorry for this , I hadn't thought of the summer time issue.

That's alright - I'm usually the one that messes that up so I was proud of
myself for remembering we're now at UTC+1 but clearly everyone else has
switched to summer time as well and didn't think about it so carried on as
normal :)

I should have checked at 10am here (9am UTC) to be on the safe side!
