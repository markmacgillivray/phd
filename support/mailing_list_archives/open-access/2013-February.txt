It contains the terms "Open" and "Creative Commons" . Some uses of these
are compliant with OKF, others are not.

Dear all,

Esther Hoorn, a copyright librarian at the University of Groningen has
written on the Open Economics
Blog<http://openeconomics.net/2013/02/01/dutch-phd-workshop-on-research-design-open-access-and-open-data/>about
the feedback from PhD students to the Data
Availability in Economics blog
post<http://openeconomics.net/2012/12/07/research-data-management-in-economic-journals/>we
had several weeks ago. Read about the students' discussion on open
access and data availability policies of journals.

Let us know what you think!

I hope Stefan doesn't mind me posting about this event here, I thought it
might help advertise

OKF Austria (@OKFNat on Twitter if you're interested in following) are
holding an Open Science event later this month in Vienna from 18:00 on
February 25th.  Further details here:
http://okfn.at/2013/02/07/open-science-grundungstreffen/

Open Research (in it's more broader sense, not just science) is going to be
one of the main themes of focus this year for OKF and we're really growing
fast in this area. Alongside Austria, I believe OKF Finland are also
looking to grow a local open science group.

I look forward to hearing a summary later of what happened at this event :)

Best,

Ross

 submitted to BIS 'open access inquiry'
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzFzehMt-i7EUQZsdajiBynZpFBj5WgFe7ttWLDmh-uew@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,


Just a reminder that today is the final day that one can submit written
evidence to the BIS 'open access inquiry'
Further details here:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/01/30/yet-another-open-access-inquiry/

Anyone, from anywhere in the world can submit written evidence as long as
it addresses the points of the inquiry

The Committee will consider a range of topics including:


   - The Government?s acceptance of the recommendations of the Finch Group
   Report ?Accessibility, sustainability, excellence: how to expand access to
   research publications?, including its preference for the ?gold? over the
   ?green? open access model;
   - Rights of use and re-use in relation to open access research
   publications, including the implications of Creative Commons ?CC-BY?
   licences;
   - The costs of article processing charges (APCs) and the implications
   for research funding and for the taxpayer; and
   - The level of ?gold? open access uptake in the rest of the world versus
   the UK, and the ability of UK higher education institutions to remain
   competitive.

Written evidence should be sent to the Committee, as an MS Word document,
by e-mail to biscommem at parliament.uk.

I am hoping Richard Smith will be submitting some expert evidence
http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/category/richard-smith/ among others.

Subject: [Open-access] OKF is doing its best to enable text and data mining
	research
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzEdH2G209rZ22pqULv0Cq-kABpMWj1nb31w=xDzvAtDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

sorry for all the announcements today. A lot is happening at the moment.

Not everyone may realise this but the Open Knowledge Foundation is hugely
influential:

1.) On Monday we were in Brussels at the *Licences For Europe meeting*,
actively participating in the first Text & Data Mining working group
meeting (#Licences4Europe on Twitter). It was largely disappointing that
the discussion was framed at the outset to exclude discussion of the type
of copyright reform many pro-access groups in the room wanted. We hope this
situation will have changed by the next working group meeting. It was
accurately described here:
https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130204/12241621879/eu-commission-wants-more-copyright-licensing-not-creative-commons-fair-use.shtml

2.) When journalists need quotes from people who know about the state of
open knowledge, we're an excellent organisation to ask!
In the latest edition of Nature I am quoted, representing Open Knowledge
Foundation on the subject of Creative Commons licencing of academic
research:
http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-opt-to-limit-uses-of-open-access-publications-1.12384

The very definition of open access (
http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/read)
states that *anyone* must be able to re-use research *without legal barriers
*. Thus NC & ND modules of Creative Commons licences if applied do not make
that research open access, and they can significantly hinder some re-uses
like textmining.
See Joris Pekel's excellent post on some of the problems of NC for more:
http://blog.okfn.org/2013/01/08/consequences-risks-and-side-effects-of-the-license-module-non-commercial-use-only-2/



Ross

PS I will try and write some of this up in a prettier blogpost on the
science.okfn blog soon.

Hi to all,

in addition to the action That Ross Mounce indicated for the house of
Commons (deadline today)  ther is another urgent matter that we should take
up.
The EU is deciding on the Horizon 2020 budget as of today and as part of
this will decide on the details of science and innovation programme. We
need to stress the importance of Open Access and open science to the
Council.
I forward a tweet send out by Glyn Moody linking to a sample letter for
your (re)action

Message-ID: <2F49241F-4A99-4C4C-913D-F4B3661BBE75@cameronneylon.net>

Dear colleagues,

OAI8, the 8th Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication will be held in Geneva, Switzerland, from Wednesday 19th to Friday 21st June 2013. Program details and registration are now available at https://indico.cern.ch/event/oai8. It will be possible to register for a part or all of the programme.

The workshop will follow the successful format of previous sessions mixing practical tutorials, presentations from cutting-edge projects and research, discussion groups, posters, and an intense social programme to maximise interaction and communication. Previous workshops have built a strong community spirit. The event is a unique opportunity to exchange ideas and contact details with a large public connected to the OA movement. The OAI workshops are a series of the most important international meetings in this field and take place roughly every two years.

Each iteration of the workshop series has dealt with issues relevant to today. This year, research data will be one of the topics tackled. In the light of the Royal Society Report "Science as an Open Enterprise", European universities are beginning themselves to consider the impact of the data deluge. The workshop will also revisit the topic of metrics and suggest new approaches.

Thanks to the continued support of our sponsors, the organisers have been able to maintain the modest registration fee at the same level as for the previous workshop, i.e. CHF 275. Moreover, a special early bird fee of CHF 230 is offered until Wednesday 27th of March.

Further information will be added to the website https://indico.cern.ch/event/oai8, including details of the Breakout Groups, of a pre-conference day about Duraspace, and the Call for posters.

The committee looks forward to welcoming you to Geneva.

OAI8 Organising Committee

I've forwarded this to lists. I am on the EU list. Ross Mounce attended in
stead of me on Feb4. I am away on the March date. These meetings are very
important I think, though perhaps Jonathan and Ross could advise. It looks
a lot of commitment.

In what I infer to be a rather political move, SPARC Europe has just
published a classification of open access funder mandates:
http://sparceurope.org/analysis-of-funder-open-access-policies-around-the-world/

RCUK is listed alone under the classification title: "Gold (journal-based)
Open Access required:"
Whilst there are 14 funders listed under: "Either Green or Gold routes
satisfy policy requirements"
My understanding of the UK policy was that it allowed either gold or green
OA, with at most gold preferred.

Why then is SPARC Europe making such a point of classifying RCUK as "Gold
OA required" ? This is flat out wrong IMO. Preferred does not equal
required! In no way is gold absolutely *required* by the new RCUK policy.
This is clear misrepresentation.

Why did they do this? Are SPARC Europe trying to help or hinder the Open
Access movement?

Hi,

I heard Alma Swan present this analysis of funder open access policies.
You can hear her speak exactly about that when scrolling to minute 42 here:
http://new.livestream.com/pedroprincipe/UMinhOA/videos/11047384

She cited the policy as one that "requires" Gold OA where available.

Reading 4. "Compliance of Journals"
http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUK%20_Policy_on_Access_to_Research_Outputs.pdf
I also see that the two options are made possible and the second one is *"Where
a publisher does not offer option 1 above". *
*
*
Do they interpret that option number 1 is the required one and option 2
should be taken only when option 1 doesn't exist? This is certainly what
Alma meant.

I think to single out the RCUK in this way is not justifiable, Alma was
quite critical on them, too.

I emailed SPARC & Alma about this. Here is Alma's reply (and the message I
sent to them). I completely disagree tbh and am at a loss with what to do
next. Alma seems to avoid directly addressing the clear point I addressed
to her/SPARC:

Dear SPARC,

It has come to my attention that you have recently published an analysis of
funder Open Access policies:
http://sparceurope.org/analysis-of-funder-open-access-policies-around-the-world/

I am perplexed by the classification of RCUK in this scheme. Fred Friend
has put it in a class of it's own under the title: "Gold (journal-based)
Open Access required"

The RCUK policy is summarised here:
http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/RCUK%20_Policy_on_Access_to_Research_Outputs.pdfIn
this document it clearly says "The Research Councils will continue to
support a mixed approach to Open Access..."

All of the documents available on the site clearly indicate that both green
and gold OA are allowed
http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/outputs.aspx if only that gold is
preferred. Preferred does NOT equal 'required'.

So whilst I appreciate that the RCUK policy has certain interesting
features, in Friend's classification scheme it clearly belongs with the
other funders in the "Either Green or Gold routes satisfy policy
requirements" category.

Could this change be made ASAP?
I fear RCUK's lone listing may adversely affect opinion of it. Furthermore
it undermines the credibility of SPARC if they publish untrue statements
such as this.


Many thanks,


Ross

Dear Ross

Thank you for your message. I am sorry you are perplexed. Our
classification, unlike that of Science Europe, is trying to show the
differences between policies and the directions in which policymakers
appear to wish to travel.

RCUK is claiming that it's 'leading the world' and Fred?s classification
reflects that. RCUK can't do that and be the same as others that have gone
before, and indeed it isn't.

This classification acknowledges the ground-breaking move that RCUK has
made. The policy requires publication in an RCUK-compliant journal, which
it defines as one that provides immediate OA (on payment of an
article-processing fee if it requires to be paid). If the journal does not
provide OA, then the Green route can be used. No other policy in the world
is the same as this and the classification highlights this individual
stance.

Best  regards,

Alma

Presumably you are worried that the classification of RCUK in solitary will
make it look bad. But you have failed to influence the people making the
classification. So instead, positively re-enforce it.

Blog and tweet etc about how great it is that SPARC have acknowledged the
leading stance that RCUK has taken, and how proud you are that RCUK are
doing such great things for open access. If only other orgs across Europe
could follow such lead, and attempt to join RCUK in SPARCs class-leading
categorisation...

I like your positive perspective, Mark. But the flat facts of the
matter is, the SPARC statement is just plain wrong. We won't advance
any agenda with misstatements.

Thanks all and particularly Ross,
This is important in that any inconsistently will be seized on by opponents
of funder mandates in general.

I wonder whether we could put out a "Panton" statement on this. We could
collate the concerns and put out half a page which those of us who feel
strongly - certainly those in this thread could support.

I might be able to do this. I think there is a rationale in beefing up our presence even if the process is frustrating.

I'm going to be in San Francisco, but I wonder if it might be worth doing a

this matters, what the opportunity here is and saying what we hope would
happen (and - more or less explicitly - what we hope will not happen)?

Dear all,

Today Joshua Gans, Professor of Strategic Management and member of the Open
Economics Advisory Panel writes about the "Big Deal" packages in publishing:

http://openeconomics.net/2013/02/18/looking-again-at-big-deal-scholarly-journal-packages/

Based on the results of
Odlyzko<http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2211874>,
there is evidence for increased availability of journals as the marginal
cost of providing an additional journal to libraries is zero in the
publishers' bundles.

There are however "wrinkles to all of this" - libraries are being squeezed
as eventhough the share spent on publisher deals has increased, their
overall budgets have shrunk. There is also an argument that publishers have
now transferred the functions of libraries (as well as the libraries'
money) to themselves.

Message-ID: <CABPM+woSp++V0W2ojOjMN+86h1naLjDHn8mSgrs5u4d5027Vqg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All

I'm organising a graduate training workshop on open access in Oxford and
our speaker is not able to make it anymore due to illness so I wondered if
anyone here might be able to step in?

I'm running one of the workshops afterwards and we thought having someone
external for the keynote would be good. The planned date was 5 March for a
40min talk at 2pm, there would then be more hands on workshops led by grads
on Open Access or Beyond Open Access (data, code etc), depending on
people's level of interest and prior knowledge. However, we could shift the
day to 6/7 or 11-14 March if that is more convenient.

We're not sure on audience size but would be aiming for about 50 people.

Let me know off-list if you might be available and thanks for your help!

Jenny

Dear all,

In regard to this article it might be useful to know that transparancy
about the big deals is recommended by the EU recommendation:

*on access to and preservation of scientific information*

{SWD(2012) 221 final} {SWD(2012) 222 final}

 

http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/document_library/pdf_06/recommendation-access-and-preservation-scientific-information_en.pdf

 

 

*p.4*

 

HEREBY RECOMMENDS THAT MEMBER STATES:

/Open access to scientific publications/

1. Define clear policies for the dissemination of and open access to
scientific publications resulting from publicly funded research. These
policies should provide

for:

? concrete objectives and indicators to measure progress;

? implementation plans, including the allocation of responsibilities;

? associated financial planning.

 

Ensure that, as a result of these policies:

? there should be open access to publications resulting from publicly funded

research as soon as possible, preferably immediately and in any case no
later

than six months after the date of publication, and twelve months for social

sciences and humanities;

? *licensing systems contribute to open access to scientific
publications resulting*

*from publicly-funded research in a balanced way*, in accordance with and

without prejudice to the applicable copyright legislation, and encourage

researchers to retain their copyright while granting licences to publishers;

? the academic career system supports and rewards researchers who
participate

in a culture of sharing the results of their research, in particular by
ensuring

open access to their publications and by developing, encouraging and using

new, alternative models of career assessment, metrics and indicators;

? *transparency is improved, in particular by informing the public about*

*agreements between public institutions or groups of public institutions
and*

*publishers for the supply of scientific information.**This should
include***

*agreements covering the so-called ?big deals?, i.e. bundles of print and*

*electronic journal subscriptions offered at discounted price*;

? small and medium-sized enterprises and unaffiliated researchers have the

widest and cheapest possible access to scientific publications of the
results of

research that receives public funding.


Best regards,
Esther

Subject: [Open-access] unbundling editorial services in publishing
Message-ID: <CAJZW5i3Vi5j00iN0R1COQg-1iGMx4rSPhH9WZ57f+wbt+ft49A@mail.gmail.com>

I know that list members are interested in the value that publishing
houses claim to add with their manuscript editing services.

In trying to help assess this, I have pointed out that manuscripts
vary greatly: the considered work of a research group in an
English-speaking country would usually require only the lightest of
editorial touches for typesetting markup and house style. But
researchers for whom English is a second language may require labour
intensive rewriting before they get anywhere near the "proofreading"
that is usually their initial request. Undoubtedly the most economical
course in the world of the subscription journal was merely to reject
poorly written work out of hand.

Some links:
A Scholarly Kitchen blogpost, which though typically biased against a
perceived threat to the established order (in this case an editing
service called AJE), nevertheless succeeds in attracting an
interesting below the line discussion by freelance editors actually
involved in the activity, with price info:
http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2011/02/15/editors-for-hire/

The PLoS approach was to refer such authors to third party services
(e.g. scroll down to section 7 here:
http://web.archive.org/web/20110723194944/http://www.plosone.org/static/guidelines.action).
Interestingly this list has now disappeared from the current
incarnation of the page: presumably (see the comments in the first
reference) these PLoS referrals are now to be bought dear by some grim
corporate mill that

[squeezes the very lifeblood out of their editors until they find a
job in a bar]*
[offers editorial services in a timely and cost-effective manner]*

*Delete one according to neoliberal preference

I've written a note to PLoS to find out more. I'll let you know if I
get a response.

Regards to all,

D.

Hi All

There were concerns raised from the first meeting that the whole working
group is geared to restrictions and proprietary use e.g. looking solely at
licensing rather than exceptions, and that there was too little open access
and academic representation.

The EC are looking for suggestions for more WG4 (content mining) members to
ensure better representation from a wider range of stakeholders, so as well
as someone to take Peter's place while he's away, if you're at all
interested in joining please say so!

It's easy for the publishers to send staff along to this kind of meeting,
it's much harder for us as academics and open advocates to find the funding
and time to attend, but the more representation we have the better so
please consider and forward to anyone not on the list who you think might
be interested.

Best wishes

Jenny

Thanks Mike,
I echo your sentiments (including your analysis of the lack of any coherent
concerted "Open Access" pollicy in the UK -
http://svpow.com/2013/02/22/the-progressive-erosion-of-the-rcuk-open-access-policy/.
The RCUK deserved our support but the OA oligarchy attacked it viciously
and relentlessly on dogmatic grounds. I have previously OKFN-blogged my
views on  the "Open" access movement (
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/26/is-open-access-open/ ).

The OKFN must never become riddled with factionalism - cf  the People's
Front of Judea (Monty Python). Its greatest assets are its
internationalilty, its huge proprtion of young people, its creation of
tools to change the world, its common purpose, its meriticracy and much
more.

Today I am going to the OKFN Open Data day in London and I'm going to have
fun and I'm going to listen to people and I'm going to help change the
world.

So is @okfn_okapi Chuff.

P.
I am of course delighted with the US policy. US politics is tricky and
there will no doubt be a backlash. As always they need our support.
As does the RCUK.


I

	SlideWiki.org
Message-ID: <5129EC7A.9010907@informatik.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear all,

SlideWiki.org is a non-profit, crowd-sourcing OpenCourseWare authoring
platform: http://SlideWiki.org
SlideWiki allows to create richly structured courseware presentations
comprising slides, self-test questionnaires, illustrations etc.
Slidewiki is for courseware what MediaWiki is for Wiki texts,
OpenStreetmaps for spatial data or GitHub for source code. With
SlideWiki, we hope to make educational material much more interactive,
multilingual and accessible.

We are now looking for additional lecture notes (i.e. slide series) for
publication on SlideWiki. We will support the import and enrichment of
the courseware in SlideWiki. Original authors will be attributed
prominently. A requirement is licensing of the content under CC-BY-SA.
We translate all SlideWiki lectures in many other languages, add
self-assessment tests, mobile learning facilities and many other
features. All SlideWiki features are documented here:
http://slidewiki.org/documentation/

Benefits for authors include:
* significantly increase your reach by making your courseware accessible
to a world-wide audience
* get your courseware translated into many different languages
* engage students in contributing to and discussing the course
* easily create (self-)assessment tests for students
* involve peer-educators in improving and maintaining the quality and
attractiveness of your courseware
* increase your reputation in the community, by sharing qualitative
educational content

Some existing example lectures include:

* Intelligent Systems: http://slidewiki.org/deck/1002/latest
* Semantic Web: http://slidewiki.org/deck/750/latest
* Semantic Web Services: http://slidewiki.org/deck/964/latest
* Information Retrieval: http://slidewiki.org/deck/345/latest
* Informationssysteme (German): http://slidewiki.org/deck/365/latest

Please send applications for publishing your lecture notes on SlideWiki
by email to auer at uni-leipzig.de till March 10 including the following
information:

* original authors (including email, address and affiliation)
* original format (pptx/ODP preferred)
* original language (English is preferred)
* volume (number of presentations and slides)
* licensing (must be compatible with CC-BY-SA)
* link to the material

Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any further suggestions
and pointers to OpenCourseWare on the Web.

On behalf of the SlideWiki team,

S?ren
http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~auer/

---------------------------
SlideWiki features include:

* WYSIWYG slide authoring
* Logical slide and deck representation
* LaTeX/MathML integration
* Multilingual decks / semi-automatic translation in 50+ languages
* PowerPoint/HTML import
* Source code highlighting within slides
* Dynamic CSS themability and transitions
* Social networking activities
* Full revisioning and branching of slides and decks
* E-Learning with self-assessment questionnaires
* Source, citation and attribution tracking

Is it only for courses or is it also for personal collections?

You could just create an envelop presentation, where you add all the
presentations you want to share as sub-presentations. We already do that
for the lecture series, where we have a deck for the whole lecture
series, with subdecks for each individual lecture. Also, each slide and
presentation has its own URL, which makes it easy to create lists of
presentation and share them. Furthermore, you can see all decks created
by you in your profile.

That's more tricky - we want to make SlideWiki.org really an open
platform and thats why CC-BY-SA is a requirement. I guess content
licensed under even more liberal licenses can be easily re-licensed as
CC-BY-SA - you could then just mention in the deck description, that
this deck can be used under even more liberal licensing conditions (e.g.
CC0). For stricter licensing than CC-BY-SA, a possibility could be to
host your own SlideWiki, but we haven't released the source-code yet
(but definitely plan to do so).

Hope this helps, please feel free to subscribe to our mailinglist to
stay in touch: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/slidewiki

Dear S?ren,

I have tried slidewiki, and found it a very interesting
and promising tools. However, I have a few comments:
- navigating content could be improved. I want to see (and share with
others) a list of my presentations, or create a subject list -  not clear
how to do that.
- licence is too restrictive. I'm afraid I can't offer all my content under
a CC BY SA licence. Some of it is subject to employer's restrictions, some
already public under a different licence. I hope you will allow authors a
choice of licences.

best,

Yishay

Ok, maybe I phrased it not precisely: You can use SlideWiki for
everything which's license is compatible with CC-BY-SA. So please add a
note stating that your content is also available as CC-BY or CC0 to the
deck description - as I understand CC-BY or CC0 licensed content can
always re-licensed as CC-BY-SA.

> And, what is implication of "You are more than welcome to use it for your personal presentations"? When would I be putting up a presentation that is *not* my personal presentation?

You could also upload CC-BY-SA licensed content, which was created by
other people. SlideWiki offers a "Original creator" field to attribute
the original author for that purpose. But my comment was more a response
to Peter's question "Is it only for courses or is it also for personal
collections?"

> Finally, most importantly, I can see the human-readable summary of the Terms of Use (http://slidewiki.org/termsOfUse). But, there is no link to the actual legal document. There is a link to Wikipedia's TOU, but Wikipedia's TOU are not Slidewiki's TOU even if the latter are adapted from the former.

Good point, we will add a full text of the TOU, soon.

Subject: [Open-access] HEFCE (UK) seeking advice on open access & open data
	research evaluation
Message-ID: <CAJr+OExpVtoi=knT54NzLPZaX33b1ZQAWxqHytMymWOxvMfjcw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In recent times in the UK we've had a House of Lords inquiry, and
a Department for Business, Innovation & Skills inquiry to which the Open
Knowledge Foundation and others have contributed evidence & advice to help
guide policy.

Well, there's now *another *consultation open. This time it's the Higher
Education Funding Council for England
<http://www.hefce.ac.uk/about/>(HEFCE) who do the job evaluating &
rating the quality of academic research
output in England (the 'REF <http://www.ref.ac.uk/>' process).

Their call for advice on open
access<http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/newsarchive/2013/name,78750,en.html>
in
the context of the REF is interesting and certainly worthy of contribution
from our community (anyone can submit a relevant statement) - I should
particularly draw your attention to the section on OPEN DATA:

24. As a principle, we support the sharing of research data as an important
approach to further
increasing the effectiveness of the research process. However, while we
expect to see
considerable progress in the provision of access to data which are
pertinent to those publications
submitted in a future REF, we do not consider it feasible at present to
make this a formal
requirement.
25. With the Research Councils and the Research Transparency Sector Board,
we are giving
consideration to the issues involved in increasing access to research data.
We are committed to
working in dialogue with the sector to develop fair and balanced mechanisms
to achieve this aim.

*We invite comment on whether respondents feel this is the appropriate
approach or*
*whether they feel that sufficient progress has in fact been made to
implement a*
*requirement for open data as well. We will consider any representations
that such a*
*requirement may reasonably now be developed but would also need advice on
how this*
*might be achieved.*

*[me:] Has sufficient progress been made in science so that Open Data
research outputs must be made available for research evaluation?
*
The recent US OSTP OA policy seemed to indicate that open data has
certainly 'arrived'. Moreover, if we *don't* reward or evaluate academics
for data sharing - this rather limits their incentives to do so.

Even if you don't want to submit a comment to HEFCE yourself about this,
perhaps it would be worth discussing the issues on-list?

The deadline for submissions is the 25th of March, so we have plenty of
time.


Best,

Ross

I think a continued neglect of data sharing in the evaluation of
research outputs is to be avoided. it would certainly be good to get
the evaluators to agree on the idea of some sort of bonus points for
research shared in ways other than through formal papers.

While the scientific community at large is probably not ready for data
sharing mandates, there is nothing wrong in working out a prototype of
such mandates for certain kinds of data, or for an institution,
journal, funder or subdiscipline.

tl;dr: Do not assume "the research community" is a homogenous group!

I'd agree with Daniel Mietchen's remark that the research community at
large is not yet ready for this. Indeed, at a recent University of
Sussex seminar that discussed the issue,* I got the impression that
some researchers would sooner renounce their claim to be 'scientists'
than publish the 'disclosive data' yielded by the interview
transcripts on which their qualitative research is based. Meanwhile,
the hard sciences race ahead, limited as much by server space and
bandwidth, as by any ethical, social or political considerations.

I'd take a somewhat different approach to worrying about whether data sharing should be enforced by HEFCE. HEFCE by its nature has to be a very conservative organisation as it has to give guidance up to five years ahead across the whole community of what assessment mechanisms need to be in place and how things will be judged. That data even gets a mention is therefore a real step.

The big opportunity here is to focus on the actual assessment mechanisms. How can we configure the development of the actual assessment mechanisms so that they reward efforts to enable re-use (including provision of data, software, etc). if we get that right then we create a tension that guides people towards data sharing because it aligns with their interests rather than creating a requirement, which will just mean people do the minimum required. My sense is that there is a real opportunity to configure REF2020 along the lines that will develop and reward best practice as it changes over the next seven years.

Cheers

Cameron
