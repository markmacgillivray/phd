Subject: [Open-access] Principles of "Open Access"
Message-ID: <CAD2k14NyBrZytN-Q8BGPbqgrhMRdbujO8xb82f8-i7HiqwnL4g@mail.gmail.com>

Mike Taylor has just been interviewed by Richard Poynder -
poynder.blogspot.fi/2013/07/open-access-where-are-we-what-still.html and I
think what he says is core to what the OKF interpretaion of OA is (as
expressed by the motivation of this list).

It's clear that the wider movement is floundering. Mike notes the great
increase in momentum, but also hints at the lack of coherence. Given the
bickering and worse of the last year or so it's not surprising that
genuinely motivated newcomers are perplexed.

I think it would be useful for this list to create a clear simple guide to
(Fully) open OA. The BOAI is clear but has been downgraded. We need to
state not only principles but some absolute positions. Such as Mike's "we
don't need publishers and should walk away".

I am going to try to marshal my thoughts by commenting on Mike's analysis
and have started at :
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2013/07/02/mike-taylors-brilliant-analysis-of-openaccess/
I believe more is needed, especially on rights and also on WHY we need Open
Access (I wish there was a new term and maybe we should strive for that).

Simply: The position is critical and critically balanced and the OKF can
make a significant difference.

I do agree with this. Imho, subdividing OA into Gold, Green, Libre, Gratis,
etc. is not helpful. Especially when half (or more) of the definitions
remove "open" from "open access".

There is nothing wrong with "free access" - both as a concept and a term.
Free access is nearly as important as open access, and shares the same
values, if not all of the benefits - that we need to ensure that
researchers are not prevented from getting access to published research.
But it should be clear that free is not open.

I believe more is needed, especially on rights and also on WHY we need Open
> Access (I wish there was a new term and maybe we should strive for that).

Or, seeing as "open" is well understood pretty much everywhere else it is
invoked, why not just defend the meaning and chase out the terms that
dilute it? There is no need for it - the alternatives are simply clearer.

Hi Ross,

Many thanks for the share.I recommend reading it to everyone on these
lists.  It is a very useful publication. Open access to (scientific)
information and open education are very closely linked.

Dear All

We are delighted to announce that OKF is collaborating with the OpenUCT
Initiative at the University of Cape Town in an International Development
Research Centre funded project to develop a southern led research agenda
for open science for development.

We hope to use this as an opportunity not only to explore research into
open science but also to really push community building efforts in the
global south and identify a strong network of open science advocates and
practitioners - maybe setting up some new local open science groups along
the way!

You can read more in out project proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGgPpd7PQtYuX-mOGE58fEbXVJgohs4O_XiBrBZph8k/edit

A small group met in London last week to set the ground work for a larger
workshop in *Cape Town 11-13 September 2013* and the results of that
meeting will be available online shortly.

We hope you are as excited about this opportunity as we are and in the
spirit of the exercise we will be making both the process and outcomes as
open as possible. Therefore, if you would like to apply to participate in
the Cape Town meeting please send us a *brief* half page introduction to
yourself including answers to the following questions:


   - Why is this project of interest?


   - What expertise and experience do you bring?


   - What would you like to see come out of this project?


Preference will be given to participants from developing countries in order
to further the aims of the project and full funding will be provided.

There is a short deadline of *24 July 2013* so please spread this
invitation through your networks, particularly contacts you might have in
the global south. If selected, we will organise travel and flights as soon
as possible.

Best wishes

Jenny

This is impressive! Kudos to all involved.

Since science is such a large field it's great that the OKF has identified
an area where progress needs to be and can be made.

I've tweeted this out a few times now, but I thought I'd also share this
with the mailing list.

Thanks to this blog from the OA team at Oxford Uni:
http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/cc-by-what-does-it-mean-for-scholarly-articles-3/

I've become aware of another published article explaining the history and
practicalities of creative commons licences published in a recent (2013)
book called: Perspectives on Open and Distance Learning: Open Educational
Resources: Innovation, Research and Practice
openly available from here:
http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=446

I've cut the open book PDF down to just Norm Friesen's chapter 6 'Realising
the Open in Open Educational Resources: Practical Concerns and Solutions'
here if you want to read it right away...
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/757135/Friesen2013chap6.pdf

(all perfectly legal thanks to the CC BY-SA licence the book is published

It's great to have more third-party reviewed evidence in support of the use
of CC BY for published academic materials whether OER or publications.
