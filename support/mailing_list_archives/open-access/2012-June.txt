Hi All,

I have just had a Skype call with Irina Kuchna of the EIFL organisation.
They work for access to science and educational material in developing
countries.
She has made a fantastic offer to provide us with interviews of people from
developing countries (Mainly Africa, Asia) for publication on the Website
Whoneedsaccess. She will propose this plan on the general meeting of EIFL
in July. She then thinks of training country representatives of EIFL to do
the interviews in their countries, and give them some incentive like the
best interview will get a prize. Will probably work better than trying to
get interviews through email.
It looks like we can expect first interviews to come our way in sept 2012.

cheers

TOM

Brilliant, this is great news. I've also got some good leads in Africa as well, possibly at governmental level.

Wonder if we could get (or maybe just put one together from public quotes) for David Willetts?

Cheers

I don't think a Frankenpost is the way to go. But actually
interviewing Willetts would be awesome. Does anyone have a contact?

Must we? I always hate thinking about funding -- it's a distraction
from thinking about the things we actual want (and need) to think
about. It's not obvious to me that we even NEED any funding for what
we're doing.

Hi all,

I am not completely in agreement with the reasoning for wanting "*BOAI
compliant open access*" as the choice term.

My most important objection is that the *Berlin declaration added
description of open access to data and metadata* which as far as I can see
were not included in Budapest Decl which focussed on scholarly
publications. The *Bethesda declaration was strong on the use of open
access publication records of scientists for appointments*:

   1. We reaffirm the principle that only the intrinsic merit of the work,
   and not the title of the journal in which a candidate?s work is published,
   will be considered in appointments, promotions, merit awards or grants.

   2. We will regard a record of open access publication as evidence of
   service to the community, in evaluation of applications for faculty
   appointments, promotions and grants.

 Then second I find the term BOAI compliant a bit cumbersome and not very
appealing.

Third I think that in the time of having all info only 1 click away ,
looking up definitions is not really a big deal,  I wonder whether many
will do so anyway. Interested people can also find all info on BBB
definition in one place in the Wikipedia chapter on open access.

I am also not wildly enthousiastic about B3 or 3B but I think we should
refer to all three definitions since they are complementary and have added
value.


cheers

TOM

As archivist I would like to second Tom. Berlin has also added the
heritage sector. Why referring only on BOAI when the most accepted (na
d newest) OA declaration with the widest impact is Berlin? The core
value in all three declarations is for me CC-BY.

That is an important issue, for sure.

I am not 100% sure that it's the SAME important issue, though.

I am VERY strongly in favour of that!

But it has no place in a *definition* of what Open Access means, which
is really what we're dealing with here.

Google for "BOAI". The top hit is the right one.

Now Google for "BBB". The meaning we intend for it isn't anywhere on
the first five pages of results. (I got bored of looking for that.)
When "BBB" is mentioned in tweets, no-one who's not already an insider
has any chance of figuring out what we mean by it.

But the real clincher for me is that if we say BOAI there is one place
that someone has to look. If they're trying to determine whether
something is BBB-compliant, then need to look in three places,
compare, contrast, interpret, try to determine whether and where the
definitions are compatible, how they diverge, and so on. All a waste
of time. This needs to be quick, simple and painless.

Hi Mike and others,

I see your point of having a single def and a single place to look for it.
I theredore agree to change from @ccess to BOAI compliant open access (I am
still not very happy with this term, wish there were something better).
Because I still think we have to somehow acknowledge the contributions of
the Bethesda and especially the Berlin Series of conferences, we could just
put a description on our website to this extent:; like:        for those
cases not covered in the BOAI definition and for updates and extensions on
the original BOAI descriptions we refer to the Bethesda Declaration and the
Declarations of the continuing Berlin Series of Conferences on open access.

cheers

TOM

Hi folks,

Been following along but not had time to write a cogent reply.

My suggestion would be as follows @ccess is a good name for our  initiative. That is a separate issue to what we want to call the target. We agree broadly on what that initiative is aiming for - and I think we agree that is actually BBB compliant because we broadly agree that Berlin and Bethesda enrich the original Budapest definition. 

However - there is an issue about pointing to a single definition. I don't think that's as much of an issue as people think - and I think that in any case Budapest probably captures enough of the meaning to be useful if we need a single link. The question is not "what is the single link that will give someone all the information" but "if someone is only going to click on one link, what is the link that gives them the *best* information". 

The OKD is not suitable in my view because it allows share-alike licensing. 

So the question of what is the "name" that we give this. I think any name either suffers from existing confusion and mis-use/disagreement, or is a new name that won't have traction. I know we are not the only group working through this at the moment - and there is a lot of thinking going on, but the message is clear and converging: "The ideal form of OA = CC-BY". I think in the short term, rather than worrying about coming up with a name ourselves we can use a short hand and "Budapest Compliant OA" seems as good as any. I quite like the idea that we could market a "B^3 OA" but we won't be able to do that alone - so better to wait until other groups have got themselves together. Then we can work as a team if a "rebranding" is needed.

Cheers

Cameron

I can see the reasons behind both labels and must admit I
don't have enough information to be able to make my decision
on what is the better pick.

So while it pains me to not be helpful at all, I'll have to
abstain from a vote and support the majority decision.

Hi all,


I totally agree with Tom, to my mind:

1) Bethesda is the least known B-event
2) Budapest emphasizes very much OA to journal articles, to my mind it 
refers *only* to journal literature and not to any other kind of 
scientific information (neither monographs nor data)
3) Berlin includes metadata, cutural heritage, research data.

I would prefer a phrase that refers to the compliance with the Berlin 
declaration.

best regards

Dear all,



I think the Open Definition OD must be the yardstick for Open Access. To 
my mind Open Access must fulfill the demands of the OD, btw the Berlin 
Declaration is fully compliant with the OD.


Best regards

Hi everyone,

I've been following this discussion for a while, and I wanted to jump in.
First I wanted to say that I _really_ appreciate your hard work and
advocacy for making Open Access more "free and open". While it is very
encouraging to see the many advances that the OA movement has made, it's
been discouraging to see how little understanding of licenses, file
formats, metadata etc in the Open Access formats. It's great if everyone in
the world are able to download PFDs from a website - but we can do _so much
more_!

What seems to come out of some of these discussions, however, and what I
feel from my own experimentation and thinking, is that there is a whole
array of different "levels of openness" or "attributes of openness" that we
would be looking for. Personally some of the things I would love to see
happen are:

* using an open license, ideally CC BY
* making the machine-readable metadata easily available for scraping on the
website where the abstract is hosted
* embedding the license and download URL in the machine readable metadata
(I've almost never seen a BibTeX citation for an OA journal that has a URL
directly to the downloadable file, or that has any kind of markup
indicating that it is OA, license etc)
* embedding the machine readable metadata in the downloadable file itself
(for example using the XMPP field in PDFs, like JabRef does)
* having the journal (or repository/preprint archive) automatically ping
some public server with machine readable metadata whenever a new
publication is published
* for the journal/repository/preprint archive to offer standardized APIs
for accessing metadata etc, and also ability to download a dump of
machine-readable metadata for every single article, as well as a dump of
all the actual article files (PDF or otherwise)
* moving from PDFs to some kind of standardized semantic file format, where
for example all in-article citations also have machine-readable metadata,
use ORCID tags for authors, DOIs or other unique identifiers for cited
articles etc
* making all data relevant to the article openly licensed (CC-0) and linked
from the article, same with source code
* moving towards "executable" papers, where all the graphs and stats and
calculations are generated dynamically using embedded code (for example R
with Knitr) and the linked open data
* etc

I am sure people could even add to this list. Now this is quite a
"maximalist" list, and I don't expect there to be almost a single
publication today that fulfills all or even most of these expectations, yet
I really hope we can work towards a future where much of this is possible -
which requires work on a multitude of levels, both better software support,
better infrastructure and standards, more conscientization of authors,
policy work with institutions and publishers, changes in funding, etc...

The question seems to be, which of these "demands" / "ideals" are "crucial"
and need to be bundled together in a statement about @access or BBB-OA or
whatever it is called? And what is the value of having one such
"milestone", as opposed to maybe a spectrum of "opennesses"? If you aim too
low, saying "We just require publications to be CC-BY licensed", that would
of course still be a huge improvement from today - but without much of the
other things mentioned, it wouldn't  necessarily have a huge practical
significance... (Hard to modify locked down PDFs...). And if you maximalize
the demand ("You're only open if you fulfill the following 20
requirements"), the movement might be seen as impractical and not attract
much interest.

So I'm not really sure what's the best way forward, tactically, to achieve
our long term goals. But I really commend you again on at least pushing to
expand the notion of Open Access, and I'll be excited to discuss how to
reach / or even begin experimenting with / many of the points I listed
above.

Much of my thinking on this comes from building my own "research workflow" (
http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start), which integrates a bunch of
tools both to speed-up my own harvesting of citations, PDFs, note taking
etc, but also enables me to share as much as possible of this with others,
as an "open scholar". Here's a recent blog entry about how I try to
determine whether a publication I import is "open access" (in my case,
simply defined as "PDF is directly downloadable from a public URL"), and
how I can then add a bunch of functionality for collaboration based on this
fact. To my mind, this greater ease of collaboration and sharing - EVEN for
people at institutions which pay for TA journals - is a powerful argument
for OA which we haven't exploited enough:

Has anyone actually used the open access filter at PubMed?
Example at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=open+access%5Bfilter%5D+malaria .
Not exactly sure how they define OA, though.

Hi All,

I think Cameron's mail is a good assessment of the discussion that we have
seen on this topic. Thank you all for your contributions to this discussion.

I have edited the site and changed our definition from @ccess to BOAI
compliant open access. I will add paragraphs on the importance of Bethesda
and Berlin Declarations.

We can wait what other groups do re the OA definition to use, and can amend
accordingly if necessary.
For the open access logo we can wait for the appropriate time to share the
idea of B^3 based design as I have shown in the last meeting (link to
Google doc)  The idea of the single B with 3 in it allows for definition
based on single B (Budapest) or or B^3.

The name of our initiative is OK and remains @ccess. A LOGO for the working
Group at OKF can be the LOGO shown in the Twitter account because it has
the @ typical for our initiative

cheers

TOM

Dear Tom,

I feel very bad that I am not able to attend to any of the skype calls...
Many times, the time does not suite me and I have some issues with my
cam/mic. But I follow the discussions and proceedings of the talk...

Thanks
Sridhar

Thank you, Sridar, 
for sticking your head out,

indeed, if we want our meetings to be "open", more time zones need to come into focus,

maybe let uns know as soon as your cam/mic problem is fixed 
and then - I'd like to suggest - we will invite you to suggest a meeting time first :-)

cheers from germany
Claudia

To: liblicense-l at lists.yale.edu


There is a new Toll Access database (with a small free section)
called Springer Images which contains pictures under a Creative
Commons Noncommercial License (resulting from Springer's Open
Choice) but without mentioning the license.

See http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/5814210/ (in German)

It is questionable if it is not legal what Springer is doing but
I am convinced that it is definitively against the spirit of Open
Access/Open Choice. If someone pays 3000 dollars for a CC-BY-NC
license he should get it. This means also that non-commercial
datamining must be allowed because the license allows it. If
Springer uses the images of Open Choice articles Springer has to
tag them with their CC license! (BTW: Google has now announced
officially the CC filter in its Image Search.)

Hi  All,

I am very sorry but a medical emergency with my mother who is in the
hospital  forces me to drop this call. I have to go there.

If you want to have the call anyway please organise yourselves (Peter could
you then do the call??)
or else I may be able to do this call myself  tomorrow

I went over my news on Tuesday, so just need to report back really, which
can easily be put off until tomorrow or next week.

Don't worry about it Tom, we will catch up another time.

I agree as well:
Take care of your mother, Tom, and worry about the
meeting later.

Hi everybody,

Thank you all for your reactions.
My mother has passed away very peacefully on Thursday evening.
These past days were filled with all kinds of formal activities around
this, like sending out cards, checking on adressess etc
I will be available for work again this coming week,

cheers

In case you haven't see this, Nature has made its metadata Open CC0. This
is good news for our Bibliographic activities. It means we can build a
Bibserver with NPG metadata and also use this to promote our activities.

I would guess that historians will recognize the role that OKFN has played
in promoting the idea of Open Bibliographic Data.

Hopefully other publishers will follow suit.

 Dear Jim,

This is great news about IMS.  Because we have very limited funding at
present, I think we will try to walk before we can run, and work out how to
incorporate citation data from a small number of high profile
subscription-access publishers first, before opening the door wide.  So
please don't be impatient - we will not get to IMS until 2013!  As for
hosting, formats, etc., the details given at http://opencitations.net may
evolve as we gear up.  However, if the reference lists of the journals
involved are already being sent to CrossRef as part of their Cited-By
Linking service, all the publisher will have to do is say "yes", and we
will collect the references direct from CrossRef and host the RDF.  No work
to do, and no additional cost!  Details of our data cleaning activities are
given at:

http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/garbage-in-garbage-out-problems-with-bibliographic-references/,

http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/who-wrote-this-paper-author-list-problems-in-pubmed-central-references/,
and
http://opencitations.wordpress.com/2011/07/01/citation-correction-methods/.



I would value an e-mail introduction to David Tranah of CUP, and will then
try to get them on board.

Many thanks for responding so swiftly.

Kind regards,

David

David, delighted to see your post

I have approval in principle from the Insitute of Mathematical
Statistics http://imstat.org to open up the metadata and citations
data from IMS Journals listed at http://imstat.org/publications/
I am working on getting an inventory of where the source data is
and what format its in. I could really use some advice on next steps,
e.g. where to get the data hosted, in what format, etc. If you have
any capability for conversion/cleaning of data to good formats I'm
sure that would be appreciated by IMS.

I also talked to a rep of CUP (David Tranah) recently, and he seemed
to indicate CUP would have no problem opening up its data. I'd
be glad to pursue this, but you may be in a better position to do so.
Generally, I think we need a roadmap for exactly what steps a publisher
needs to take to publish their citation data in a useful way, with
indications of what costs may be involved.

Great to see the progress on this front!

with best wishes

The Hargreaves Review recommendations on reform of UK copyright, which
include important exceptions to enable text- & data-mining, are meeting
predictable opposition.  An Early Day Motion
http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2012-13/151 has been tabled urging the UK
Govt to implement the recommendations. 

 

UK list members can help by writing to MPs asking them to support the
EDM.

Very sorry, but I am going to have to cancel at the last minute too. Next
week I am in Amsterdam though so anyone who wants to meet up there, please
contact me direct (e.g. Tom, perhaps).

Here is an update about further checks on the deduplication process:

Tom has pointed out that it is odd there were 4980 in medline, 3825
malariaworld and 2608 wikipedia and yet when we deduplicated against
medline we only found 1641 in malariaworld and 1258 in wikipedia. Where do
the other roughly 2200 and 1400 records come from?

We know that the wikipedia collection is based on the open access subset -
which despite the name is NOT a subset of the medline but a subset of PMC
(which is not the same as pubmed...). So it can contain articles that are
not in medline. Here is an example:

http://malaria.bibsoup.net/test/wikipedia/anewantimalarialdrugagainstmurinemalaria

It has a PMCID of 3019440, but there is no PMID registered against it
(confirmed on the PMID to PMCID converter). Searching for it in the full
medline does not return a result. It is in PMC, but not in Pubmed. Medline
is a representation of Pubmed, whereas the open access subset is a
representation of PMC.

Also, the Malariaworld collection contains 582 articles that do not appear
to be from 2010 or 2011, despite the dump being for 2010 and 2011. This
goes towards explaining why they were not found in the medline collection
that we filtered for these years. Also, similar to above, it may contain
articles that do not appear in Medline at all.

So within our own collections we do not appear to have duplicates any more,
despite the above situation. Any manual checking that people on list could
perform would be great, and let me know if there is any more evidence of
failure to deduplicate.

If we want to take these checks further, the only thing I can think of as a
next step would be to run a comparison of every record in our malaria index
against pubmed and pmc searches - this could be done by some scripting
against the query interface at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/gquery

Let me know what you think.

Mark

I'm here, but if you'd rather postpone until there's a bigger crowd that's
fine by me.
Thanks for organising, it's never easy to find a time to suit everyone.

[Forwarding from Theo Andrew, via the JISC-Repositories list. ?--Peter Suber.]


?The Open Access Index is a new initiative funded by the JISC-Elevator
scheme. We propose to construct a method to measure an author's
engagement with Open Access which could be represented by a relatively
simple numerical score ? the Open Access Index.

We are now in a position where we have access to the information to
calculate such a score through sources including large bibliographic
databases, current research information systems, repositories and SHERPA
Romeo.

Before we start would like to hear your views on whether there is there
a need, and how should the index be calculated:

http://oaindex.org/blog/2012/06/oa-index-survey/

If you have an interest please follow the link and fill in the survey
which consists of these 4 questions:

1. Would an Open Access Index be useful?
2. We'd like your thoughts on why this index would be beneficial, and if
not, why not?
3. What factors should be considered in the construction of an OA-Index?
4. Would you be interested in being further involved?

The OA-Index team will be attending the Open Repositories 2012
(http://or2012.ed.ac.uk/) conference in Edinburgh where we will hold
an initial meeting. If you are attending the conference and want to
have some input into the OA-Index we are seeking expressions of
interest so we can get an idea of numbers to arrange a suitable venue
- please get in touch with us.

Don't know. We are looking at journals, they are looking at authors.
however I know Theo and I will also be at that event, so will see how we
can collaborate.

Hi,

I must say that I am a bit surprised. But I have also been afraid for a
long time that something like this would happen, because I felt that the
idea of OA Index had been around for so long.
We did advertise our ideas on an open access index openly, it has even been
on the homepage for quite a while.
I also informed a lot of people of it and by now I would have guessed that
many in the open access movement would have heard of our ideas.
What surprises me most of all is that they have an open access index
initiative funded by JISC???
I have been pushing for funding and we are in the process of contacting OSF
for the funding of our open access index.
It is true that their ideas are for an open access index for authors and
very different from ours. But this will be very confusing to say the least.
And I am not willing to changer names. We really had the name OA Index
before anyone else .I even had a domain reserved 8 months ago
openaccessindex.org.
I think it is very urgent that we claim the name open access index for us.
But rtell me your views.

TOM

I think probably there would be good potential to just combine them up - if
Theo and the library people here are looking at doing an OA index for
authors, and JISC are funding it, and you are looking at other sources, we
can pool them together under the term "open access index". We were already
at the point of thinking we would need multiple figures to highlight
varying aspects of open, so having one for authors and one for journals -
and myself and others at cottage labs were originally interested in one for
institutes - would be no bad thing.

Hi Mark,

I have given it some thought and I think you are quite right.
Best we can do is collaborate on the set of indices, ours, the malaria OA
index, journal OA index and Publisher OA index as well (my proposal that I
shared in the very beginning), theirs: author OA index, cottagelab:
institute OA index
I think it would make sense,  if they want this collaboration, that we try
to get funding for the whole project, i.e. file a proposal together. It
will increase our chances for funding.
I have no idea what their funding now looks like, but I guess it will
probably be small.
Could you please try and find out ASAP if such a collaboration is possible?
I have heard from Yrina Kuchma that EU openaire is interested in
cooperation on this subject as well.

Then I really plan to get our open access index article out real soon, also
to promote funding possibilities.
. So let's start rolling!

cheers

Hi Tom,

I will see if I can meet up with Theo on Monday or Tuesday and find out
more details. Also as mentioned, I will be in Amsterdam this week - I get
in late on Tuesday night and am probably busy Wednesday, but if you are
free on Thursday I will be in town until my flight in the early evening. I
have not been there before and have no idea of the location, so if you
could possible come to somewhere quite central, that would make it easier
for me to meet up. Then we could discuss how to proceed and report back to
the group.

Mark

Subject: [Open-access] Reminder: Open Science Hackday: 7 Jul, London
Message-ID: <CABPM+wr0L8_euQETvK8MVyEM8kJ-e_EL-egum7L2d5gyTUd9Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Just a reminder that the next Open Science hackday will be taking place in
a couple of weeks and it would be great to see some of you in person or
online! Please sign up as soon as you can for numbers and so we can see
what interesting projects people are interested in working on.

When: Saturday 7 July 2012, 1000-1700 UTC+1
Where: Centre for Creative Collaboration (
http://www.creativecollaboration.org.uk/ ), London
OR
OKFN IRC channel (#okfn on irc.oftc.net and full details of how to connect
(including via a web browser) can be found at: http://okfn.org/contact/)

Sign up: http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7

Our last outing to the Barbican saw a small but dedicated group working on
projects as diverse as services for open access policies, extracting
phylogenetic tree information from PDFs, storing crowdsourced data in CKAN
and more. This time we're going to be bigger and better with a dedicated
space which will hopefully be filled by YOU.

If you'd like to come along, please add yourself to the Etherpad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7 and if you have a specific idea
you'd like to work on, add that too and you'll have a couple of minutes at
the start of the hackday to tell everyone about it so we can link you up
with people who'd like to help.

You don't need to have an idea for anything to work on or even any coding
skills to join, there are plenty of opportunities to get stuck in with
other people's projects and many non-technical tasks, especially if you
like writing or design.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask and I look forward to
seeing many of you on 7 July!

Jenny

I think this is a very good time to go to JISC and see what opportunities
there are. They support collaboration and this seems an excellent extension
of our work.

Dear Tom and Others,

Yes we need 'Open Access Index' as its different from other indices which
are in the Scholarly Communications.

After the World Repositories Ranking and after series of discussions (part
of advocacy) among my peers, I was looking at how to rank the institutes on
their 'openess' and i found Openness Index <
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_index>. But its a econometric index!

The reason is that when to compared among the authors, institutes and
others, we need a index.... when all of our agricultural journals are not
indexed in Thomson Reuters or Scopus, our NAAS <http://www.naasindia.org>
had worked out its own rating.

When we (OA advocates) had talked to fellow colleagues, they said what
benefit we get from our assessment authorities if we make our papers
'Open'. I think if we get a index, we an ask our assessment authorities in
ICAR <http://www.icar.org.in> to allocate marks for contributions in 'Open
Access'

I would like to be part of the group which is working for the 'Open Access
Index' for authors, journals and institutes.

Thanks & Regards
Sridhar

To Craig Brierley, Media Relations Manager, Wellcome Trust

Dear Craig,

Please regard this as fan mail: no need to reply.

I cheered, yes CHEERED, when I read this:

"despite our open access policy having been in place for over five
years, still almost half of these publications remain restricted
behind subscription paywalls. This is simply unacceptable, and so with
immediate effect we will be tightening up enforcement of our policy."

[http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2012/WTVM055745.htm]

Bravo! Hats off! Lang may yer lum reek! And other encomia ad lib...

Craig,

Please add my loud, sustained applause. It's absolutely grotesque that
researchers are accepting Wellcome money and simply not doing what
they undertake to do in return. I delightedly welcome your refusal to
keep feeding them more funding.

This is a potential opportunity for our Open Access index. Assuming we can
find all the papers in the scientific literature we can find the
affiliations of the authors. Very often this has addresses which include
the string "Wellcome". This is likely to be someone in a "Wellcome unit",
so we could index these against whether the paper is Open.

It won't be 100%

I tried this at one stage with Cell and "Medical Research Council". I go
the impression that a lot of papers were not Open. Maybe they were in a
repo somewhere (or maybe not).

It would be particularly useful to do this as the papers were published. It
gives us an excellent reason for crawling the literature with Pubcrawler.
It could generate a lot of interest (not all would be appreciative!)

BibServer also automatically checks every record title for an equivalent
paper in any UK HE IR too, so if they are in there we can automatically
link to them (and I should also admit, link to a few wrong ones by mistake
at the moment).

Hooray for Wellcome and open access!

Dear all,

I gave a talk at a palaeontology conference in Cambridge recently; May 24th 2012
introducing the Open Knowledge Foundation to young academics.

I was thinking this recording might be of interest and/or use for
further outreach.

The audio recording of this is now available to listen to on the
internet via SoundCloud.

Huge credit to the organisers (http://www.palaeocast.com/) who
recorded it with such clarity.


The audio here is:
http://progpal2012.tumblr.com/post/26077977142/ross-mounce-the-open-knowledge-foundation-the
and corresponding Prezi slides here:
http://prezi.com/w0d29prhs-nd/the-open-knowledge-foundation/
(almost entirely recycling/repurposing slides from Rufus Pollock &
Simone Aliprandi, with attribution and links given)


Comments / feedback very welcome - this was my first time introducing
the OKF to a new audience.


Best,

Ross (in California atm)
