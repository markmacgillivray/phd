Subject: [GOAL] Discussion on Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes required by
Librarians for Open Access


{Apologies for Cross Posting}



I am currently assisting the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia
(CEMCA) in developing Curriculum and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) Tool for
Open Access for researchers and library and information professionals as a
project of UNESCO. The UNESCO adopted Open Access strategy in 2011, and
with effect from 1 July 2013 it has become fully Open Access. Capacity
building to promote Open Access is one of the important strands of the
UNESCO strategy.  The UNESCO Open Access Forum 2011 also recommended
training of young researchers and library professionals on Open Access.


As a first step, we would like to seek help of experts though a discussion
on this platform to identify Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes needed for
Open Access by Library and Information Professionals and Researchers. So,
we will have two strands of discussion: One for Librarians and the other
for Researchers. This week we start with training needs for Librarians?


Librarians play a significant role in providing access to peer reviewed
information published in journals and help manage local repositories.
Sometime back we did a Delphi study with select experts, which revealed the
following as key areas for the librarians to study:

* *
*Module 1: Foundations*

1. Introduction to Open Access: Definition, types (green, gold, delayed),
OA journals (gold and hybrid), OA books, OA repositories, benefits,
barriers (publisher resistance), philosophy of access to knowledge,
disciplinary trends; Open Access Policy development, including funder
policies

2. Copyrights and licensing mechanisms for Open Access, such as the
creative commons licenses, copyleft and publishers? embargo in
self-archiving

* *

*Module 2: Practical Options and Systems*

3. Repositories and issues involved in creating and maintaining
repositories, author self-archiving

4. Open Access Journal publishing systems and processes

* *

*Module 3: Initiatives, Implications and Issues*

5. Searching of Open Access information (Vehicles for Open Access: OAIster
and other Open Access Search Engines, PubMed), Metadata related issues,
SHERPA RoMEO, DOAJ, DOAB, GOAP, OA Map, etc.

6. Impact of Open Access on dissemination of knowledge, citation
advantages, estimating impact; Changing practices in scholarly
communication, including open peer review, emerging approaches to
recognition of scholarly works

7. Implications of online-only format for long-term preservation of OA
content (Google Books, Internet Archive, Hathi Trust, other non-U.S. large
initiatives)



While this is useful, we need to identify the Knowledge, Skills and
Attitudes to develop the curriculum and content learning materials. You may
also like to comment on the suitability of the above topics. If you want to
share more on the topic privately, kindly do so in the emails:

Message-ID: <CA+4KT3oexu+76zwCObvE86dgwZf_fXd_wDGr+-9SyE9xH1tAuw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

There is a discussion started by ms. Barnali on "Promoting Open Access
amongst young researchers" at WSIS (
http://www.wsis-community.org/pg/forum/topic/834997/promoting-open-access-amongst-young-researchers/
)

Here is the text of the post written by Ms. Barnali (
barna.chakrabarti at gmail.com)

{Apologies for cross posting}

I am currently assisting the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia
(CEMCA) in developing Curriculum and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) Tool for
Open Access for researchers and library and information professionals as a
project of UNESCO. The UNESCO adopted Open Access strategy in 2011, and
with effect from 1st July 2013 it has become fully Open Access. Capacity
building to promote Open Access is one of the important strands of the
UNESCO strategy. The UNESCO Open Access Forum 2011 also recommended
training of young researchers and library professionals on Open Access.

In the last week, I requested for help on articulating the training needs
of library professionals, and this week I would like to request the
stakeholders to think about what new researchers should know about Open
Access. We believe that the OA awareness of the researchers that can make
the Open Access movement more successful. In subject disciplines, where the
researchers are more aware and have common goals, the amount of information
available in OA is much higher than other disciplines. So, it is always
better to follow the principle of "catch them young", and include a short
training curriculum on OA for every researcher working for their doctoral
degree. This can be a pre-doctoral work as well. If such a programme is to
be organized, what are the knowledge, skills and attitude that should be
covered in the training?

In a survey conducted amongst researchers in a prestigious national
university revealed that most of the respondents indicated limited
participation in open access mode of communications either as users or as
contributors. The study also revealed that their participation can be
increased through appropriate training, and awareness creation. So, what
you think as the areas that should be covered in OA training for
researchers?

Your response will help us to articulate more precisely the topics related
to knowledge, skills and attitudes for Open Access. If you want to share
more on the topic privately, kindly do so in the E-mails:
smishra.col at gmail.com and barna.chakrabarti at gmail.com

With apologies for cross posting.
I just realized I did not notify the open-access listservs of my latest
blog post. I only posted it on my twitter feed.

Here it is:

The Empire Strikes
Back<http://scitechsociety.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-empire-strikes-back.html>
 <http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=4430152077491545869&postID=4774253132065441492&from=pencil>
Publishers may soon compete with libraries. The business case for enticing
users away from library-managed portals is simple, compelling, and growing.
As funding agencies and universities enact Open Access (OA) mandates and
publishers transition their journals from the site-license model to the
Gold OA model, libraries will cease to be the spigots through which money
streams from universities to publishers. In the Gold-OA world, the
publishers' core business is developing relationships with scholars, not
librarians. For publishers, it makes perfect sense to cater to scholars
both as authors and readers.

Dear Sir/Madame!
The ongoing project ?Policy RECommendations for Open Access to Research
Data in Europe? (RECODE - http://recodeproject.eu/) will leverage existing
networks, communities and projects to address challenges within the open
access and data dissemination and preservation sector and produce policy
recommendations for open access to research data based on existing good
practice.
One of these challenges are the technological barriers to Open Access and
Preservation of Research Data, and the possible solutions adopted to
mitigate them.
We have identified you as a person engaged or interested in the movement
for open access to research data and would therefore kindly ask you to
assist us with the objective of identifying the technological
infrastructural requirements for Open Access to Research Data in Europe by
filling out this questionnaire:

Hi Joe and David

Great idea! I'm copying in the open science and open access mailing lists
as well, Mike Taylor who is a member of these lists started a site called
Who Needs Access? http://whoneedsaccess.org/ containing interviews and
features on people who have been hindered by a lack of access to research
(as well as those who have been helped by open access). Perhaps there might
be scope for combining our efforts and helping out on your initiative!

Hi Jenny!

Thanks for cc'ing! We know about, and love Who Needs Access! In fact we
spoke about it very early in the project - the personal story aspect of our
idea actually probably has it's inspiration from there. We haven't spoken
about it recently but I think a collaboration there would be very natural.

At the moment we're just trying to get it up and running in a form which is
feasible for users! Hence why we need the hackathon (once again please sign
up<http://oabutton.wordpress.com/2013/08/27/oa-button-hackathon-7-8th-september/>
even
if you'd like to hack remotely)

Great Peter! We'll release location soon, just seeing if we can get C4CC or
if we're going to use our back-up. That's one reason why it's important to
sign up!

Thanks,

Joe

Subject: [Open-access] Scholarly Publishing in Africa - Invitation to
	Participate in Survey
Message-ID: <CAJtxkco-gqSTu3+Ob-SNgv4=nNRdNwYoJ33qkYqmhVDnnFTShQ@mail.gmail.com>

*Apologies for cross posting*

Dear colleagues,

With all of the changes in scholarly communication and ICTs over the past
few years, we are interested in learning more about the current state of
scholarly publishing throughout Africa.

Clobridge Consulting is working in partnership with African Journals Online
to conduct a research study to collect, analyze, and disseminate knowledge
in this arena ? in order to share best practices, identify emerging trends,
and gain insights from editors about their successes and concerns. While a
good deal of research has been conducted over the past few years regarding
global trends in the shift from print to digital, changing dissemination
and business models, and uptake in technology to support publishing, no
research has focused exclusively on these issues within Africa. This
project is designed to explore such questions specifically within the
African context.

More details and access to the survey are available at:
http://clobridgeconsulting.**com/scholarly-publishing-in-**africa<http://clobridgeconsulting.com/scholarly-publishing-in-africa>

*All journal editors and publishers of African-based journals are invited
to participate in the study. *

The survey is available in English and French. An offline version is
available upon request. To request an offline version of the survey or to
share comments, questions, or concerns, please email
kim at clobridgeconsulting.com. The survey will close on Friday, 6 September
2013.

Many thanks,
Abby

Subject: [Open-access] Save the date: OKCon satellite event Geneva,
	19 Sept 2013
Message-ID: <CANACerHpP-1mvjgKUtO+P6DSG1tKfsVz-3mE_BaM6BhnXxiWZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I hope you've enjoyed a beautiful summer and vacation :)

As you may remember, the idea of organizing an OKCon satellite event for
Open & Citizen Science enthusiasts stemmed a few months ago. We had a few
community calls since then, and the OKCon program curators helped us make
such an event reality!

*Save the date!* The Open & Citizen Science satellite event will take place
on 19 Sept, in Geneva. You can get further details from the event's
description: http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-b/

*Event content*: this day is what we make out of it :) You are more than
welcome to submit your ideas through the dedicated form (
http://openscience.alpine-geckos.at/projects/okcon-openscience-hackathon-submission/).
We'll update you weekly with the new submissions. Also, a community
call
is scheduled for next Thursday, September 5, 4pm CEST, if you are willing
to discuss, narrow down ideas, etc.

*Accommodation in Geneva*: there are still several subsidies left! Check
http://okcon.org/accommodation-subsidies/ for more info and contact details
for booking. This is a great possibility to stay in Geneva without ruining
yourself -- and to attend the satellite event ;)

Looking forward to meeting you in Geneva!
Rayna & Stefan

Well, it?s been a long time since the last update! There?s a lot of stuff
this time, and it?s heavily skewed towards free, libre and open (because
that?s the content that I can be bothered creating entries for).

Brief Survey

Hi folks,

I?d appreciate it if you could answer these two questions for me ? either
on this list, or email directly to me.

   1.

   *What is stopping you from contributing to FOSsil Bank?
   *When I set up the FOSsil Bank, I expected members of the community to
   contribute to the catalogue. After a few years, about 99% of the 1000+
   entries were added by me. I don?t resent this, but I?d like to get more
   involvement from others.
   2.

   *Does having the raw links instead of hyperlinks change your experience?
   *It?s a bit faster for me to copy-paste the URL rather than set up a
   hyperlink. But if that reduces readability, I?ll change back.
