Subject: [Open-access] Second Skype meeting
Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMaxSq2YKG7e2iWgJmHH9ot+w8qqbT+9CPyxS-LSiVHMFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Following on from the successful skype call last week (see notes
here<http://lauranewman.okfnpad.org/newOAinitiative>),
it was agreed that a second skype call should be held next week.

The main topic of this call will be to discuss a proposal by Tom Olijhoek
regarding an open access index (Tom, I believe you wished to circulate
material before the meeting?).

The doodle poll to arrange the time can be found
here<http://www.doodle.com/ydhrc72cagw3eg88#table>.
I will leave the poll open over the weekend and confirm the time of the
meeting first thing on Monday.

Have a good weekend!
Laura

Message-ID: <CAGyWN8Z9DMAoi+3qW9Pujm5EmMHuYR4V-Ea3EAZpV4csniTv3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi to all,

I would like to start my postings to this list with my view on the need for
a new OA initiative: purposes tasks, possibilities, branding and other
topics. I want to stress that all this is open for discussion and
represents my personal view.

The main reason for founding a new open access initiative is that the OA
movement is too fragmented to be effective. Equally important is the fact
that the term Open Access is used by many with quite different meanings: we
need to reclaim the term  Open Access to mean exclusively  Open access
according to the definition of the Budapest Convention, as we have
discussed by previously.

Therefore II like to propose as a first task for the new initiative
establishing a logo or badge for Open Access: we can give publishers /
authors the rights to use our OpenAccess Logo/Badge ( as proposed by Mike
Taylor in the preceding discussion) as certified proof for Open Access for
given articles.  Establishing ourselves as a certifying organization could
perhaps serve to generate some modest funding.

To promote open access publishing and draw media attention we will need a
name , a Logo and a ?special? product. The product could be an Open Access
Index for access to disease information. We can start making and publishing
an Open Access Index for Malaria with other diseases following suite. In
parallel with the development of an Open Access to [disease X] information
Index we can develop ORR?s for the disease. At a later stage we could add
the Open Access Publisher Index described in the documents form the Dutch
Malaria Foudation. For a name I suggest that we use Open Access Foundation
initiative, in anticipation of the founding of an Open Access Foundation
(see below).

At the same time we should commit ourselves to the building of a community
of [Disease X] stakeholders (researchers, patient groups and others) and
offer them a platform for social interaction (discussion, collaboration).
For this we could (for instance) copy the ResearchGate model. In addition
we can encourage researchers to deposit their papers with us (as
ResearchGate users do on their platform). Proceeding in this direction we
will hopefully find ourselves hosting a number of Circles (of disease
interest) and indexed open access publications. I am convinced that Open
Access and community building are both indispensible ingredients for an
Open Science Society ( see e.g. my
blog<http://www.malariaworld.org/blog/open-science-communities-and-evolution-open-knowledge-society>).

At that stage, or already after establishing  one Circle (malaria) we could
transform into an Open Access Foundation which acts as Open Access
watchdog, certifying body for Open Access publications  and social media
platform for the building of Circles (communities) of malaria researchers +
other groups, cancer researchers + others, Lyme disease + others etc.
(modeled on the ResearchGate community). For this to work we should also
invest in the development and improvement of tools for easy access to
information and tools for social networking.
Where do publishers fit into this scheme. Ideally publishers should be
influenced by the Indices of the Foundation to move towards open access
business models. This could mean that scientific publishers transform into
service providers ( see Cameron Neylon?s blog) offering information
storage, ways of easy access to information, platforms for collaboration
etc. , what one could call evolution towards a publishing 2.0 business
model replacing the anachronistic publishing model that many scientific
publishers continue to use today.

I very much like all the ideas proposed here, and I think that
reclaiming the term "open access" to mean actually open rather than
whatever is the least the publishers can get away with calling "open"
is important.

My only reservation is that I fear the possibility that starting a new
initiative will further fragment the already fragmented OA landscape
rather than serving as a condensation point for a more unified voice.
(I think of the many attempts to unify document formats by making a
simple metaformat that can be translated into HTML, RTF, etc., with
the inevitable consequence that the new format becomes just one more
format that needs supporting.)

What can we do to avoid this?

-- Mike.

Hi,

I have made a visual presentation of the ideas in my previous posting. One
time as a PDF file , the other is a java applet in a zip file which allows
to expand the branches of the mindmap in a browser (Chrome or other).

Regarding Mike's question, I think that because we build communities around
medical themes, the Open Access message will have a lot more impact and
hopefully mobilize many silent voters. Those people already active could
still be attracted to our initiative because it offers ways for direct
online contacts in  one's own discipline and means of finding collaborating
partners. Scientists from outside of the medical field might feel inspired
to start their own circles on our site.
If all this works as planned, existing initiatives could be attracted
because of our MO factor , still continue to do what their initiative set
out to do but link to us because of the added value we offer. So yes, I
expect that we we are going to act as a GLUE more than as another splinter
group.

I think we would have difficult labelling it as "Open Access Foundation"
without the rest of the community being involved and I don't think that
would happen within years. (Some have just announced Enabling Open
Scholarship) So I think we should not use "Open Access" as a formal label
for the whole thing - although something like "Open Access (to) Research".
might be acceptable. This would also emphasize the science side.
It's sufficiently different that it doesn't splinter the activity
unnecessarily. We can also emphasize BOAI / CC-BY in a context which
doesn't directly challenge them.

It's 100% a political question. The "mainstream OA" community has a
philosophy that simply using the term "open access" is sufficient - it
doesn't matter what it refers to. I have spent years trying to influence
this and got nowhere. We should build something of value - where the OAness
is fundamental but not challenging and then when it's a success bring it
back in.

Right -- the Budapest node.

Which leads me to ask: what happened to the original group that put
that definition out and built the website?  Are they still running?
If so, could we do this in concert with them?  After all we are
working to promulgate their definition; and any branding program would
have more weight if it was associated with the Budapest initiative
itself.

Are you sure that's true?  All I am seeing along those lines is
Stephen Harnad pasting the same long comment into a hundred different
blogs' comment streams.  He is loud, sure, but there is only one of
him.

I believe that OSI (now OSF) people are committed to full BOAI. Peter Suber
laments the failure to live up to CC-BY but deliberately takes a neutral
stance - he refrains from activism on this issue. IMO this is a pity. SPARC
used to be strongly CC-BY  but I get the feeling this has somewhat lapsed.
I think JanV believes in CC-BY.

I think he has built a position where no-one dares challenge him - he wears
them done. People like me who challenge non-BOAI get lots of pushback and
no support. So I don't believe that anyone (publicly) feels this is a
problem. There is "GreenOA" and that's an "equal partner" with GoldOA and
so it persists. I believe it won't change.

Subject: [Open-access] An anti-RWA bill
Message-ID: <CACnMvBYVwzoUi=UqdRYw7hN97=YbrP+VFYCHXfHOZaEyyndwsw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

The point has been made in respect of SOPA and PIPA that although the
recent Internet blackouts of sites such as Wikipedia halted the
current approach, they have not resulted in any actual progress --
just in retardation of the rate at which we're going backwards.

Assuming that the current round of revolt against the RWA is
successful, the same will be the case with respect to academic
publishing.  I find myself thinking that rather that fighting a
rearguard action, we should be taking the battle to the publishers.  I
would like to see a movement to get rid of the NIH's twelve-month
grace period before the articles it funds are posted at PubMed
Central.

Does anyone have any idea how such a thing could be kicked off?  Would
it be a legislative matter, so that we would need to approach a
congressman to propose it?  Or is it something that the NIH itself
would do?

-- Mike.

Or to broaden it: pass an act requiring all federally-funded research
papers to be open access.

That is MUCH better.  It's what I should have said in the first place :-)

So does anyone know a congressman we could approach?

the very beginning. Why couldn't we start with a small group and get
community support in the process? It would probably be better to not have
too many factions involved in the beginning since this would be more
difficult to manage ( this has been said before we started this mailing
list: keep it small for the moment).
If we seek collaboration with the originators of the BOAI (and I am all for
that to happen) we wouldn't challenge anybody, except for the people who do
not want "real" open access. And I would think that we want to challenge
them, that is one point of the whole exercise. If we don't get the
collaboration, "at least we have asked" (as I remember this has also been
said before in our group).
In my view a logical  first step in reclaiming the term Open Access is to
use it in the name of the new Initiative, especially if we want to start a
kind of certification with an OA-LOGO.
I cannot judge whether using the term Foundation would imply that we have a
big organisation. As far as I know you can start a Foundation with as few
as 3 people. I read in Wikipedia that the term does not carry legal clout
at least not in the UK. In  NL we would have to be registered. A foundation
Initiative though would not be much of a problem anyway, or am I wrong?

I think the "something of value" could be the establishment of the Open
Access Index, it would be something very new and innovative and could
easily become our branding mark And it certainly wouldn't antoganize
existing groups

SPARC offer certification, though I don't get the impression it's as active
as it should be. Maybe we should start with areas they don't cover.

Yes - in the UK it doesn't take much to set up a Foundation in the
beginning. Getting support is probably more difficult. It will be quite a
lot of work. Yes, ask the original members and see what happens. We aren't
asking their permission - we are asking their support.

I'm happy to be part of this - probably a good idea if there are fresh
drivers. There's more detail we need to work out

If SPARC already offer certification then rather than splinter OA
certification we should get on board with their effort and see what we
can do to push it along.  We do NOT want to get into a
NetBSD-vs.-FreeBSD-vs.-OpenBSD situation here!

Hi All

Just to make you aware of a community that we should very much engage in
our efforts, the HIFA forum is filled with doctors and HCPs from the
developing world who want access to healthcare information. There have been
several frustrations vocalised about the limitations of HINARI and they are
very pro OA. Several prominent members spoke at the BMC Open Access Africa
conference and I think it would be worth contacting them to join our
discussions and be a champion of the developing world HCP community
scholarly poor in the same way that Tom, Gilles and Graham can act as
champions for specific disease information.

There are specific ways we could link the forum to Open Research Reports
and I'll send a separate email about that to the open-science list later.

 Thank you for your relentless efforts, Dr Ana. I am persuaded that we
should keep pushing...one day, "the wall will fall". Evidenced based
medicine can only be a reality if a source like HINARI is made available to
ALL!!

Congratulations to HINARI, OARE & AGORA.

I sent a message yesterday to encourage HINARI to extend its permissions to
private health facilities. I am not sure whether HINARI permits access for
_public_ health facilities (Hospitals & Clinics) unless it changed its
policy recently. The State Ministry of Health applied to register the
Centre for Clinical Governance, General Hospital, Calabar, Cross River
State, Nigeria but the application failed in 2005 and 2006. The hospital is
the flagship hospital for Cross River State with a population of three
million people.
I wolud be very glad to know if the policy has changed.

The success of HINARI reflects the tip of the iceberg in the spectrum of
possibilities. If they can extend their limits to cover health facilities
and not just institutions, very much more mortality and morbidity will be
prevented.

What would be a rational reason to send our
publications to publishers, only to then retrieve
it from them again, even if it all were OA?
Their format (and I don't mean the layout) would
still be closed, non-interoperable and without any
standards.
What do publishers do we can't do better, for less
money?

Keeping publishers just adds reform upon reform
and we'll not be alive to see any of the
technology the general public has around today,
ever be implemented. Why would they give up their
profits without at least using them against us?
They can spend more than 10 million US$ every
single day for years to fight us. Do you have any
idea how many politicians you can buy for than
money?
This fight is like the entangled fly trying to
convince the spider not to eat it.

There is no law required to convince our libraries
we don't need publishers any more.
We don't need to pay our librarians to get access
to them.
Why would we keep giving publishers millions every
single day, which they only use to fight us?
Cut off the funding for the publishers and all our
problems are solved - the money we save builds the
technology we need.

The current system is like asking them to take our
money to fight us, that's worthy of Monty Python
("let's call it a draw!"), but not of scholars.

I'm not supporting anything that keeps publishers
in business, unless someone can convince me that
it's not a Monty Python sketch.

Best,

Bjoern

Everything you say is true.

But.

It's a question of strategy.  How we get there from here.  If you go
to 100 randomly chosen scientists from randomly chosen institutions,
you'll get 87 blank stares 12 furious arguments that some form of the
journal system is necessary, and -- if you're lucky -- one who will
sign up for your Destroy All Publishers campaign.

Politics is the art of the possible.  What's possible *today* is a
strong move towards universal open access within the existing
publishing system.  (Or at least open access for federally funded
research in the USA.)

Once that has been achieved, the publishers' position will be more
precarious, and it will be more apparent to more academics how little
we need publishers.  From there I think we may be able to push on to
your dream scenario.  (Publishers know that they will be more
vulnerable in a more open-access world.  I think that is the main
reason they oppose it -- more than short-term profits, even.)

So how do we get there from here?  One step at a time.  Let's not
throw out a hugely useful candidate step, such as federally mandated
OA on everything it funds, because our eyes are lifted too far to the
heavens already.

[Thompson's Rule for First-Time Telescope Makers.]  It is faster to
make a four-inch mirror then a six-inch mirror than to make a six-inch
mirror.

I agree that we should do everything we can to not be a 'splinter group'.
The only thing on which we need to be immovable is sticking to the BOAI
definition of OA for our own projects and initiatives, beyond that it
should be about dialogue. I think we avoid splintering by:

1) Ensuring that whatever we do is not a redundant effort, if someone else
is doing it already we should start a dialogue with them to push things
forward, not start a rival initiative (unless our efforts fail and there is
no viable alternative that captures what we want to do e.g. if SPARC
decided that they wouldn't exclude CC-NC from their OA label criteria -
this is a hypothetical situation as I don't know what their current
criteria are!).

2) Focusing on open access for all, not just the scholarly community. We're
not interested in the academic debate per se, we're interested in actively
making things happen and building tools/apps/resources that are genuinely
useful for evaluating the state of open access as it stands or increasing
the production and consumption of OA materials, especially in terms of
access and usefulness for the scholarly poor. Reclaiming OA as per BOAI is
fundamental to what we do but that doesn't exclude us from working on
practical things with people who hold different views and I think that
pragmatic slant is what will stop us being just another group of people
with a slightly different message shouting to be heard.

3) Making efforts to bring in people who to some extent are excluded from
the OA movement by its academic nature. We have Graham and Gilles who have
by their hard work already made an impact there and represent a lot more
people from their respective groups. In this way we're adding people into
the community rather than taking them away and one would hope that
providing a platform and prominence to these voices within the more
established OA groups would be a unifying feature in terms of expanding the
goals of the current OA movement rather than splitting our work into a
separate stream.

We can discuss further on the call on Thursday, there are probably many
more things we can do, but these are the main ones I thought about.

Does anyone know an insider at NIH who would know enough about current
feeling at the organisation to scope whether they would push for this
themselves? Perhaps with some pressure from either a congressman or senior
scientists (I'm not sure who holds most sway with them)

Just wanted to add a hearty +1 to everything Jenny says here.

Whatever happens, we don't want to end up becoming the People's Front of Judea.

Exactly.  Also: there are multiple interested parties, and this is a
simple agenda which could unite them as a broad alliance.  For
instance, my main interest is in broad access for reading the
literature, so that I - and other interested members of the public -
can read it.  I don't care so much about the license (except for
ideological reasons).  Text-mining semantic web types care very much
about the license - they need to be able to process papers, not just
read them - but might care less about the business model (for
instance, they might be affiliated with an institution which could pay
an access fee, if a publisher had a business model which allowed
text-mining for a fee).  An individual researcher writing a paper
wants more readers but is likely to be quite conservative about change
(for good career reasons: they need to worry about impact factors,
citation counts, and so on).  A politician might only care about the
optics and the sound-bite ("you paid for this work with your tax
dollars but they lock it away from you...").  An entrepreneurial
publisher might be interested in an OA business model which allows
them to massively undercut Elsevier/Springer/NPG and grab
market-share.  A librarian or institutional leader wants to cut costs
but worries about unforseen consequences of revolutionary change.

All these different people can get behind a universal OA mandate for
taxpayer-funded science, especially now that the RWA and the
anti-Elsevier campaign have brought the subject to the top of the
agenda and highlighted the ridiculous imbalances in the current
system.  But many of them might be wary of, or opposed to, a campaign
to abandon the journal system altogether.

If you set out to go far, nobody comes with you.  Take a single step,
and many people might step forward too.

This was the same sort of question I faced with the Science Code
Manifesto.  It's obvious to me that all science software should be,
and one day will be, open-source.  But I want to gather signatures and
support from people who have never even heard of "open source", and
from people who have vague misconceptions about "intellectual
property", and from people who don't know or care about the network
and productivity benefits of open-source.  So the Manifesto doesn't
say, or imply, open source, and the arguments I use for it are mostly
concerned with fundamental scientific-method principles.

 I'm very responsive to the current discussion. I am increasingly
interested in doing something different rather than incremental in the
current system. I also want to work with current groups where possible but
not to be subsumed into them.

I think we should establish our own identity as roughly "within the OA
community but distinct from existing efforts". Our strength is that we are
practising scientists and identify closely with authorship and readership
in the most general sense. We have the energy, vision, and hopefully
eCharisma to attract like-minded people and grow organically. We also are
skilled at web technology and developing tools.

When we have established our raison d'etre to our own satisfaction we can
certainly approach a selected number of other groups. We should probably
identify areas where we can hope to offer something substantive and
valuable wh ich will help to attract people and funding. This may well be
OpenResearchReports but there may be other things.

Hi,

I totallly agree with you, Jenny! We want cooperation wherever possible and
we want to concentrate on the countries / groups of people in need. These
are the basic purposes we have to communicate.
 That said, I am not so afraid of becoming just another initiative in the
OA ocean.  I feel the need for a new initiative for all the reasons that
have been brought up .If we can engage formerly quiet people like malaria
researchers in Africa, and like the activists from the HIFA forum that
Jenny talks about in the other mailing our initiative will represent
something unique. I think we need to be very careful to communicate all our
purposes in a clear way, see whaT OTHER GROUPS ARE DOING  and decide what
we want to do. The initiative must  have a bottom-up structure: I see a
main task in coordinating various efforts and offering a communication
platform for community building. I think someone like Peter Suber could go
along with this. Another unique selling point for our Initiative could be
the promotion of (the usage of) an OA Index.  This could .become a valuable
PR tool to encourage scientific publishers to adopt OA, to encourage
scientists to publish in OA journals and for others to get involved in the
movement..

I haven't met a single person, yet, who is married to the
current system. All we need to present is something that's
superior than what we have now - and that's really trivial,
especially given the kind of money we'd have at our
disposal. No human being, let alone a scientist would pass
up on saving time and money. 

So we only need to talk to a few, select librarians with a
sufficiently large budget that would allow relatively
massive funds to be freed pretty much instantaneously. With
only ten libraries each cutting just 5 of their most
expensive journals, we'd have ~600k per year. this of course
quickly scales with the number of libraries and number of
subscriptions cut.

Two years with ten libraries and maybe a grand total of 2-5
million in budget would easily let us construct a data and
literature database that is vastly superior than anything
available today - because something like that doesn't even
exist. After two years, we'd be able to offer services
too enticing for anybody refuse.

Yes, that'd be fantastic progress: Elsevier charging 25 grand
for a Cell publication or NPG 15 for a Nature paper - so you
don't have to just bribe the editors, as today, you also have
to get a mortgage on your house if you want to have a job.

Given the track record of the publishers now, an author
pays OA model will most likely be even worse than what we
have today. 

> Once that has been achieved, the publishers' position will be more

Why? What's keeping NPG from charging 15k per paper? If
nothing else changes, we still have to publish there to
survive. With less and less tenured faculty jobs around,
that pressure will be even higher then it is now!

For the US scientists, this means that on top of the ~100k
they are in debt after college, they have another 50k on top
in debt for publishing fees.
What's the appeal in that? Why should I spend even a single
minute of my day fighting for that future? because then at
least the tax-payer can read everything? Sorry, if only the
rich get to be scientists, most of these papers will have
to be retracted anyway.

I'd say it is fairly obvious that if we only aim to change
that and nothing else, the situation would clearly be worse
and I don't understand why I should fight for a worse
situation than that we have now. I would oppose that
alliance as counter-productive.

Which is precisely why we aim at the reading end first and
not at the publishing end. Publishing in our system is
something that comes automatically, when fewer and fewer
people read the dino journals, because they can get all the
information better and more effortless in our system.

Yes, I'm so looking forward to publish the one paper that's
going to give me tenure in the cheap also-ran, instead of
getting that mortgage to pay for the Cell paper.

Journals that publish less than 8% of all submissions
because everybody has to publish there to survive can charge
almost what they want: look at tuition fees - it's the same
thing! A paper is then merely the cost of another semester.

Why would they, given that universal author pays OA would be
even worse that what we have now? I'm surely not behind a
universal OA mandate without embargo, because then it would
simply be Elsevier & Co hyperinflating their author charges
like they are subscriptions now and the only party with a
benefit would be the tax-payer - at my expense. This I will
oppose.

The journal hierarchy needs to be destroyed as well, and
then there's even less use for commercial publishers.

That step, if universally realized, would be worse than what
we have now (at least for scientists) and so I'm clearly not
supporting it - I would actually work against it.

I might be neutral towards incremental changes, but a step
backwards that's being sold as an incremental improvement, I
will oppose.

I hope I haven't alienated anybody now? I've been awake for
almost 40h after a transatlantic flight and might sound more
agonistic than I am. I have gained these insights in the
last few weeks and so far, nobody has been able to disperse
my arguments.

All the best,

Your jetlag is probably interacting poorly with mine.  I'm trying to
understand you, but not getting anywhere.  You appear to be declaring
yourself as an enemy of increased open access.  You're entitled to
that position, but there may be better venues to air it than on this

Can someone with first-hand experience of the NIH OA mandate clarify
how it is working at the moment?  My understanding is that a
publication goes through one of the usual channels, with some sort of
twist on the copyright transfer (e.g. a prior license having been made
and not nullified by the transfer), and papers are also then submitted
to PMC (within 12 months etc).  And, if I understand correctly, the
same is approximately true for all papers from  some institutions
which have an institutional OA mandate (Harvard?).  The traditional
journals put up with it because they have to (the NIH and the
institutions being the larger gorilla).  This is what I imagine when I
say "universal OA mandate": extend this tried-and-tested NIH system to
all other US federal funding agencies.  The fact that it has been in
place for several years without the sky falling ought to help
considerably with enacting something like that.

It's hardly the golden uplands of the future (and it certainly
wouldn't be the end of the road), but it's not Bj?rn's vision of hell
either.

Specifically, is this the case, today, for NIH funded scientists?  Are
they forced to pay publishing fees by journals in exchange for obeying
the NIH mandate?  And are they having to pay these fees out of their
own pockets?  Thus costing them tens of thousands of dollars?

Can someone with first-hand experience please chip in here.

If all publishers went for author charges, what would be
keeping them from increasing the charges as they have
hyperinflated subscriptions?
NPG claims, each paper costs them 10k pounds, so 15k? is a
low estimate for a Nature paper that makes a profit for NPG.

Given that you need 3-4 top journal papers, you have about a
50k additional charge if you want to get tenure.

This means that not only do you need to 'know' the editors,
you also need to have extra cash - doesn't matter from where
- and that is clearly worse: if only the rich can afford the
top-publications. It's worse than now, because the scholarly
poor now can at least ask the author for a PDF.

Not every grant will come with an extra 15-30k for the
expected CNS papers, maybe just the 1-2k for a P1 paper.
Thus, if your rent and food and that of your family depended
on these CNS papers, wouldn't you pay them out of your own
pocket, just like tuition? Of course you would!

So you might have OA for the taxpayer, but for science, it
would be worse: science would degenerate into a vanity press
of the rich and well-connected with probably a hundredfold
increase in retractions, because those who can pay the most
will get published.

So: better for taxpayer (superficially), worse for science
and scientists (and hence for the tax-payer in the long
run).
Universal author pays can only work sustainably with heavy
regulations and non-profit publishers.

Hope that focused it a little.

Best,

Bjoern

Not me and I expect no-one else either. Our strength is that we express
ourselves strongly in the open. If we say something that doesn't work out
(like I did just now about scientists) we scratch it and try in a different
direction. We clearly have differences of opinion and we have to work out
something that is imaginative and feels right.

I hypothesize: exactly the problems you describe would prevent such a

Bjorn,

One of the big advantages of a switch to author-pays is that it
doesn't hide costs.  At the moment, an author will choose journal A or
B for his paper without consideration of how expensive that journal is
-- because it's libraries that have to pay.  When one party chooses
and another pays, that is a cast-iron recipe for an inefficient
market.  But when the scientists choosing which journals to place
their work in are the ones paying, the costs of inefficient journals
will no longer be concealed at decision time.  Journals will have to
compete on quality of service and on price.  And once we have an
efficient market, many of the practices that are currently common will
become impossible to sustain.

-- Mike.
