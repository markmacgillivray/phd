Dear all,

Last week, we had a blog piece from Ross Mounce about Open Access journals
in Economics<http://openeconomics.net/2012/10/26/review-of-open-access-in-economics/>
highlighting
a thriving scene of open access in economics.

This week, Dan Scott from the Social Sciences
Directory<http://www.socialsciencesdirectory.com/>writes about the
hindrances open access journals encounter in his piece on Reputation
Factor in Economic
Publishing<http://openeconomics.net/2012/11/01/reputation-factor-in-economic-publishing/>
on
the Open Economics Blog. Dan relates his experience in gathering support
for the Social Sciences Directory start up and makes some suggestions on
how the hindrance of the reputation factor could be overcome.

The piece is also published on the main
blog<http://blog.okfn.org/2012/11/01/reputation-factor-in-economic-publishing/>
.

Comments and discussions are very welcome!

Dear Karl and Sage (and others)

Thanks a lot for the kind words!

The short answer is that there isn't a mailing list exclusively for FOSsil
Bank updates?yet. I've approached the OKFN-AU about getting a mailing list
with them (they have an open invitation to related organisations), but if I
don't hear back from them I'll definitely get in touch with
QuestionCopyright.org

In the meantime, if you have a web feed reader you can use the Living Libre
blog's RSS feed <http://livinglibre1.wordpress.com/feed/>. It's not
exclusively FOSsil Bank updates, but it's pretty close.

Cheers,

Publishers are manipulative capitalists who extort academia by holding
hostage the research papers they stole from helpless scholars on a mission
to save the world. This Hitler vs. Mother Teresa narrative is widespread in
academic circles. Some versions are nearly as shrill as this one. Others
are toned-down and carry scholarly authority. All versions are just plain
wrong.

To see how this ends, go to

Copied only to the OKFN open-access list.

It may be useful to consider the question: "what can we do to change the
situation?" - the OKF has a strong tradition of building things to change
the world. The distinction between publishing for communication and
publishing for reputation is valuable. Maybe by changing and improving the
former (which I think OKFN is well placed to do) we can separate them.

This is a generalization. Many learned societies and scientific unions are

The distinction between publishing for communication and publishing for
reputation is valuable. Maybe by changing and improving the former (which I
think OKFN is well placed to do) we can separate them. 

This is the mission of the journal I work on - we aren't interested in
chasing a respectable impact factor and we don't charge at either end, we're
also starting to publish/translate from other languages for free.  We want
everyone to be able to read and publish articles with no barriers.  There is
funding available for us to do this so it shows that it can be done.

 

We're currently looking into Alt metrics as a fairer alternative to the
impact factor - I'm hoping this is the way publishing will go

As I wrote on the LSE Impact blog back in March:
http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2012/03/26/visibility-scarcity-cant-serve-two-masters/

"And let?s say it once more: for-profit publishers can?t exactly be
blamed for this. It?s the nature of the beast. Remember, directors are
required to act in the financial interests of the corporation. It has
narrow, focussed concerns. I am reminded of Captain Quint?s
description of a shark in Jaws: ?what we are dealing with here is a
perfect engine?  All this machine does is swim and eat and make little
sharks.? It does what it does; and it does it with perfect
single-mindedness.

And that is why talk of such publishers being ?evil? is really
misplaced. They do what they do. It would be more accurate to call
them ?blind? or ?unthinking?. When they fight tooth and nail to
prevent open access, they are no more being evil than a shark is when
it attacks its prey; no more evil than a brick wall across a motorway.

But here?s the thing. If a shark threatens people, then it has to be
destroyed. A wall across a motorway has to be demolished. And publicly
funded research has to be made publicly available. It isn?t necessary
that we morally condemn a publisher that gets in the way of that
self-evidently just goal. But it is necessary to get it out of the
way. To demolish it, if it won?t move."

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEy7L+LGpjmCD7DZ88Oe3wDDE67yCXqSNxrkQJ3+_DK6Tw@mail.gmail.com>

Outrageous press release from Nature Publishing Group today.

They're explicitly charging more to authors who want CC BY Gold OA,
relative to more restrictive licenses such as CC BY-NC-SA.
Here's my quick take on it:
http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/11/07/gold-oa-pricewatch/
More money, for absolutely no extra work.

Horrid :(

Bj?rn I agree.

I just wasn't expecting NPG to be so bare-faced about exploiting the new
push for OA, to squeeze out every last ? profit possible - upto an extra
?400 it would seem for the 'privilege' of CC BY.

They have their headquarters in London, and yet they make a change to their
pricing scheme that obviously exploits new RCUK policy?

Even if this is 'expected' rational behaviour from a for-profit commercial
publisher - to maximize profits; I hope I've made their announcement and
its possible consequences more well known now.

Perhaps the UK government could step-in and examine whether these
additional 'premium' OA charges are actually justified?
Get some actual market regulation in to stop this absurd price-hiking.

I cannot imagine many deadtree (paper) reprints would be sold for
non-pharma related articles. Can one really justify an extra ?200 charge on
a Psychiatry article to be published CC BY in '*Translational Psychiatry*'?

This looks interesting.

The Denton Declaration calls itself "An Open Data Manifesto" - but suspect
it is more of "An Accessible Data Manifesto" (there is no explicit mention
of data licensing, legal status or reusability).

This initiative looks interesting, because it is about self behavior as science managers in panels and similar decisional environment. It is I think an important advocacy step, before even people get to think of the technical aspects of licensing. Let's sign!

Subject: [Open-access] Copyright Law Destroys Markets
Message-ID: <50AB6BA8.3080209@tunedit.org>

A few days ago, Republicans released a report about flaws of copyright 
law, suggesting revolutionary reforms. Very important initiative for all 
academia. Scholars should speak and strongly back the initiative, to 
help liberate academic literature. You can read a write-up here 
<http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121116/16481921080/house-republicans-copyright-law-destroys-markets-its-time-real-reform.shtml>. 
Some quotes:

  * [about term of protection]/... Gradually this period began to
    expand, but today's copyright law bears almost no resemblance to the
    constitutional provision that enabled it and the conception of this
    right by our Founding Fathers.//
    - Original Copyright Law [AD 1790]: *14 years*, plus 14 year renewal
    if author is alive.
    - Current Copyright Law: *Life of author plus 70 years*; and for
    corporate authors *120 years after creation* or 95 years after
    publication.

    /
  * /copyright continue to be extended perpetually, ensuring that works
    *never* actually enter the public domain (...) that would
    effectively nullify Article I, Section 8, Clause 8 of the
    *Constitution* which provides protection only for "limited times."

    /
  * /[copyright] *penalizes legitimate journalism* and oversight (...)
    Current copyright law allows for producers of written materials,
    such as memos or other documents, to claim copyright when they are
    seeking to hide incriminating information.

    /
  * /Because there is minimal or nearly non-existent punishment for
    bogus copyright claims today, false takedown requests are common and
    have a chilling effect upon legitimate speech.//(...) This often
    leads to de facto *censorship*.

    /
  * /Current copyright law does not merely distort some markets --
    rather it *destroys* entire markets.

    /
  * [from Infringement Nation] /things you do every single day are
    infringing and leave *every single person* liable for *billions in
    damages* each year/

(emphasis mine)
There's a separate section on academic literature. Quoting in full:

*B. Hampering scientific inquiry:*
Scientific papers from the early portion of the 20th century are still 
under copyright. . .
This is illogical, as the purpose of most scientific papers is to 
further intellectual
inquiry, and the goal of most authors of scientific papers is to advance 
their field and
to be cited in other publications. Many professors are assessed upon the 
number of
citations for their major works. For these reasons, keeping their work 
in what are
effectively locked vaults defeats the purpose of much of their work.
Obviously these producers need to be compensated to justify the cost of 
their
research, but after around 14 years, most, if not nearly all, of the 
earning capacity of
their work has been exhausted, and at that point the overriding interest 
is in ensuring
that these works are available for others. While there are exceptions in 
the law for the
use of this material for good faith exceptions, there are numerous 
examples where
for-profit entities want to use published journal articles but are 
unable to do so
without negotiating a payment to the producer of the content.
If however, these older papers were available online for free on Google 
Scholar to
anyone to access and use after a reasonable period of time then it would 
greatly
increase the availability and utilization of scientific analysis.

Yes, it was retracted because of corporate lobbying, but it can very 
well get back on the agenda if only public opinion requests this - 
that's why academia must stand behind this report. The fact that such a 
document was prepared and came to light is already a big sign of change 
and should be pushed forward despite retraction. A petition was started 
to request republishing: everyone can sign it here

hi @all

I would like to suggest that it is now the right moment to write a mail to members of the ITRE committee 
whom you consider "your MEPs" (for whatever reason, maybe same languages spoken...) and their staff.

I suppose my own version will be something like (in several languages, one at a time)

Subject: 28 Nov ITRE: Only real open access saves real lives
(--- adapted from Tom's motto, thanks, Tom)

"Dear ...

in your ITRE committee's session on 28/29 November

please make sure that open access includes all scientific articles.

Reason: Also the local doctors trusted by your friends and family need fast and free access to the newest 
research to know which cure is best. Real open access saves real lives.

best regards"

suggestions for amendments welcome as always

Dear All.

The last @ccess meeting was already a month ago!. I have had chats with
several people, but feel the need to have a plenary meeting again.
I hope you will find the time to have a short update and discussion on how
things concerning OA  are going.
As Peter Murray-Rust is in Australia I already announced last time that I
would have the time of the meeting adjusted for him to be able to
participate.

Please Join Us  on Friday  Nov 23  2012  at 10.30 am BST+1

meeting pad is at

cheers

Subject:(draft mail) now write to your MEPs see Fw: ITRE committee members Fw: Re: [Open-access] 
Horizon2020 current draft anywhere?

hi @all

I would like to suggest that it is now the right moment to write a mail to members of the ITRE committee 
whom you consider "your MEPs" (for whatever reason, maybe same languages spoken...) and their staff.

I suppose my own version will be something like (in several languages, one at a time)

Subject: 28 Nov ITRE: Only real open access saves real lives
(--- adapted from Tom's motto, thanks, Tom)

"Dear ...

in your ITRE committee's session on 28/29 November

please make sure that open access includes all scientific articles.

Reason: Also the local doctors trusted by your friends and family need fast and free access to the newest 
research to know which cure is best. Real open access saves real lives.

best regards"

suggestions for amendments welcome as always

Claudia

I haven't had time to really get to the bottom of this but I would strongly suggest *against* arguing for voting against this amendment. The situation is that this is the compromise amendment that has been agreed by those MEPs that are pro-OA (most of them, although not all very well informed) and the small number against.

The critical part of the text is that OA is mandatory for articles and will be defined in the grant agreement. The text is imperfect, mainly due to being unclear rather than any bad intentions I feel, but its probably what we can get, and it means implementation is the place where it can be got right.

So by all means call for clarification or point out weaknesses - but a vote against the compromise is a vote against including the OA section at all.

Cheers

Cameron

Subject: [Open-access] is open access only for rich countries? invitation to
	a discussion
Message-ID: <50AE166F.20005@ajantriks.net>

Participate now in an online dialogue on open access and the developing 
world

You are invited to take part in an online discussion on Open Access (OA) 
from the perspective of the developing world.

Funded by DFID, through the Mobilising Knowledge for Development (MK4D) 
programme in the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, 
and managed through the African Commons project in South Africa and the 
Centre for Internet and Society in India, the discussion will be hosted 
on UNESCO?s WSIS Open Access Community Forum. This open access dialogue 
will provide a valuable space to discuss different perspectives on what 
open access means for the developing world and what it can offer.

There is compelling evidence which indicates that OA has finally entered 
mainstream discourse. Yet, in the developing world context there remain 
specific challenges and untapped opportunities for OA. A series of open 
access discussions aimed at developing world critical thinkers, 
activists and academics, seeks to explore insights and articulate 
opinion on OA in the developing world.  Join us for stimulating debate!

Register here: 
http://institutefordevelopmentstudies.createsend1.com/t/r-l-kuxltt-jluthukldd-j/

Setting the context

Open access has enjoyed a great deal of acceptance and growth over the 
last decade, with a particularly strong spurt in the adoption of open 
access policies by major agencies and governments in the last 12 months. 
With open access policies and initiatives now being taken up by UNESCO, 
the World Bank, the FAO, the European Commission, and the governments of 
the United Kingdom and the United States, among others, it is clear that 
open access has entered the global mainstream. These policies stress the 
human rights potential of open access in providing access to scientific 
and cultural knowledge, ensuring its impact and ensuring public access 
to publicly funded research.

We now know that open access can work in the immediate and short term in 
providing better access to the research literature, whilst some of the 
longer term consequences and effects are still emerging. This is 
especially so in the developing world, which has been badly served by 
the publishing system we have inherited from the 20th century, which has 
marginalized research from developing countries. New opportunities and 
possibilities are created by open access, and, at the same time certain 
pitfalls need to be noted and avoided.

A foundational report prepared to inform this dialogue shows the risks 
posed to all scholarly communications, discourse and practices by the 
publish-or-perish system, and indicates that in the developing world, 
the detriments are potentially much deeper and more damaging.  As 
researchers are incentivised to publish in overseas-based journals - 
mostly unavailable in many developing world contexts - this research 
?brain-drain? risks widening the gap between research and policy [1].

Get discussing!

The first debate will kick off on Tuesday, 27 November 2012.

A general topic will be complemented by two sub discussions.  The 
discussion will be hosted on the WSIS Knowledge Platform's Open Access 
group. To take part you will be required to register on the platform.

KEY TOPIC: Production, publication and consumption of scholarly 
knowledge and OA.

This will focus on the greater concern of scholarly research in the 
developing country context debating the questions: What does OA imply 
and offer the developing world in terms of production, publication and 
consumption of academic materials and research activities? What are the 
specific challenges and opportunities for access to knowledge in 
developing countries?

Within this topic the following sub-themes will be introduced:

Sub-theme 1: Considering the issues of 'translation' of research for 
development impact; co-production and increasing access to academic 
materials; and the importance of OA in producing and sharing of 
non-state-supported educational materials; and

Sub-theme 2: OA in academia and the search for global prestige; the 
perverse impact of metrics and rankings; scholarly knowledge production; 
and sharing and consumption challenges in developing countries.

We will keep you posted about the second debate which will take place 
early in January 2013.

In the meantime you are also encouraged to tweet about the discussions 
using hashtag #developoa or follow the debates on Facebook here

Dear all, 
during our session we made up this draft, feel free to spread it in the networks that you think are useful

in case you do not wish to write your own version, you might wish to use this one (or translate it into a more 
suitable language, of course)

actually, this is a novel kind citizen science grassroots democracy that is much needed in today's EU, I guess
cheers, Claudia

Subject: 28 Nov ITRE: Only real open access saves real lives 

"Dear ... 

in your ITRE committee's session on 28 November on Horizon 2020 you will vote on the implementation of 
open access to all scientific articles and data. I would recommend you vote in favour of this document not in 
the least because open access will boost Europe's innovation potential (Neelie Kroes).

For me as a European citizen it is very important to have open access because I need access to information 
especially to medical information. Indeed, everyone should be concerned because local doctors trusted by 
your friends and family need fast and free access to the newest research to know which cure is best. Real 
open access saves real lives.

> Greetings Open Colleagues:
> 
> Creative Commons (CC) is in the final stages of preparing draft 3 of 4.0 for public comment.  I want to call your attention to an open proposal (not yet incorporated in the draft or in any way committed to by CC) that would benefit from your input at this time, as it would have the potential to impact the OER and OA communities if it advances.
> At issue is whether to require licensors to undertake an affirmative representation and warranty that they have secured all rights the work subject to the CC license. This means that licensors would be required to assert that they have all the necessary rights to publish the content under a CC license. Introducing an affirmative representation and warranty on the part of the licensor would be a change from how CC licenses have operated since version 2.0, which places the responsibility on the side of the user of the CC licensed work, who must do the diligence to ensure that he/she has all the necessary rights to use the licensed work. (Note that there have been several proposals in the making, this is a general statement for purposes of eliciting feedback.) 
> 
> Introducing an affirmative representation and warranty on the part of licensors would be a change from how CC licenses have operated to date, with the exception of the version 1.0 licenses which contained such a provision. That provision was removed from the licenses at version 2.0, and has remained absent since. The reasons for that change in policy are collected and explained at the link below.
> 
> http://wiki.creativecommons.org/4.0/Disclaimer_of_warranties_and_related_issues
> 
> CC is only evaluating this proposal at this stage.  As part of that evaluation, it would be good to understand from the OER and OA communities, what impact, if any, the inclusion of an affirmative undertaking would have for 4.0 uptake by OER and OA providers and users (who often become providers in turn when they remix and share CC licensed resources).
> 
> Please review the link above, where many of the pros/cons of this proposal have been set out. 
> 
> Note that we have already built into 4.0d2 the ability for licensors to make warranties as part of the CC license if they choose.  Under the proposal above, licensors would not be given the option but would be required to provide those if they wanted to use 4.0.  The same is true of users of those 4.0 SA works were they to remix 4.0 SA licensed learning materials, for example, and then share those materials with others.  This is because any adaptations of an SA work must also be licensed under the same (or later) version. Were this proposal to advance, the only option for licensors wanting to use CC but unable or unwilling to make a representation and warranty for any reason -- whether legal, policy, or simply as a matter of choice -- would be to stay with a pre-4.0 license (other than v1.0). 
> 
> Once again, please keep in mind that this proposal is still in the discussion stage. CC will not be changing course from 3.0 absent a compelling proposal, an understanding of the chilling effects and tangible benefits associated with the tradeoff, among other things.
> 
> Thanks in advance for your consideration and constructive input.

I have only got one reaction from Bjoern this time that he could not make
it.
Today when I started the call I found that nobody is available and I do not
see why I should keep trying to organise weekly Skype meetings

I think it would be best to start next year with a request to see who wants
to have these meetings so that I know that people will be there to talk to

cheers

Hi Tom,

I am sorry to hear that there was nobody attending the call today, I hope
you don't feel discouraged about that. Weekly calls in terms of frequency
is maybe too often, maybe a monthly meeting instead?

I have signed up to the open access mailing list just some weeks ago
because this is a relevant theme for economics, too. I put the Open Access
WG in the list of relevant projects on http://openeconomics.net/

I will follow your work and would try to participate next time. Thank you
for you time organising this!

Hi Tom

Apologies for not attending @ccess meetings for quite a while, I find it
difficult to Skype during working hours. As Velichka said, I hope you don't
feel too discouraged, your work in organising the calls is very much
appreciated and attendance has been very low or non-existent at
open-science calls in the past as well.

With the science wg meetings I always ask people to sign up on the Etherpad
if they are planning to attend rather than asking for apologies (although
sometimes these are given spontaneously anyway), it might be worth trying
that to give you an indication in advance of whether people will show up so
you can decide whether or not to go ahead with the call or reschedule.

Jenny

PS I saw a note on the Etherpad here
http://open-access.okfnpad.org/36about finding for an open science
conference. The Open Science Summit is
coming to the UK in Oct/Nov 2013 and we should make full use of this to
assist with the main programme and organise satellite events - more info
coming soon when the team recovers from the 2012 one and starts planning
the next!

Well there wasn't quite nobody...

Both myself and Mike Taylor were on Skype along with Tom. But we didn't
feel we had enough critical mass or matters to discuss to start the call
today.

I'm sure once we have @ccess issues to discuss we'll get back in the swing
of Skype meetings :)


All the best,


Ross

Hi,



Today when  I checked the online status in Skype  I only saw that Mike was
online but he has not participated for a long time. Then later in the chat
I saw that Ross was also available apparently so yes it was not that nobody
was there........

nobody has to apologize, we just need to organize things differently..
I think that you are right  and that it would be best to try an @ccess
meeting once a month, and keep the possibility open for specific meetings
when something urgent pops up.

For me it would have been important this time to find out if there was any
news form the vote in the EU on 28 nov.
And it was important to see if anything had been done with the open access
index manuscript if Claudia would have been available. Because in the last
meeting I had stressed the point that the paper had to be made ready for
publication and Claudia volonteered to take a look. The only thing I heard
back is that it was 75% ready and that after the weekend I would here more.
Which did not happen.
I guess in order to have the manuscript submitted real quickly I have to
take matters in my own hands again

cheers

TOM

I am afraid that we had an electric storm in Australia that knocked out
Telcos in local regions including ours.
