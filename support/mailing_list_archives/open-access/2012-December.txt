Hi Tom, 

hi everybody, thank you for clarifications,

re the manuscript of our open access index manuscript, I said "next week" and this week is not over yet, at 
least not for me. If you feel it is better you take the work into your hands as originally agreed, feel free to do 
so. Good editing has already been undertaken by a colleague with a Dutch name and I would like to suggest 
to accept these changes to a large extent and acknowledge this contribution accordingly.

in case you have any questions on the manuscript, Tom, feel free to contact me in any way that is fine for 
you, 

thanks & cheers,
Claudia

Hi all, and sorry Tom - your efforts are appreciated. Especially at times
when others missing it, it is important to have you still trying to pull us
together.

Rather than weekly or monthly, perhaps once a fortnight, then people could
make whichever one suited best (or both).

Fridays will remain problematic for me as that is the day my group at uni
meets up, but i know moving it from Fridays was problematic for others, so
no need to change it on my account. I will try to make it to the most
critical meetings (based on topics listed on the pad) and skip something at
the uni if necessary.

Message-ID: <50C1BC75.2010204@ajantriks.net>

Dear all,

Hope you are aware of the debate on Open Access taking place at the WSIS 
Knowledge Communities discussion forum.

The debate has the broad topic of -- 'is Open Access only for rich 
countries?'

The discussion can be accessed here: 
http://www.wsis-community.org/pg/forum/topic/586392/is-open-access-only-for-rich-countries-participate-now-in-an-online-dialogue-on-open-access-and-the-developing-world/

For a summary of the debate so far, the three posts by Eve Gray are very 
helpful:

Hi all,

I'm sure many of you will be aware of the criticisms of the UK government's
Finch open access proposals. For example:

http://thedisorderofthings.com/2012/12/04/open-access-hefce-ref2020-and-the-threat-to-academic-freedom/

While the inclusion of CC-BY as a standard means it is compliant with the
latest Budapest Open Access Initiative recommendations [1], as a humanities
researcher I can see why people are complaining about the Article
Processing Charges (dubbed ?pay-to-say?).

I wonder if anyone who has been following the debate knows of any concrete
suggestions for improvements to the Finch model which retain CC-BY as a
standard, but which would enable scholars to have more choice as to where
and how they publish?

All the best,

Jonathan

The mixing up of the CC-By debate with the actual infelicities of the Finch report (being here euphemistic) is really unfortunate. The Finch report and the overall publishers' dictated policy is just to be forgotten by those who do not live in the British isles (and we do sympathize with those who do). However, we do need, as scholars, simple attributive licenses such as CC-BY to make the dissemination of scientific results as fluid as possible, and this where the debate should stay.
Cheers,
Laurent

Everything I've read on that blog site (not just that post) is extremely
(overly) negative about the Finch policy IMO. I've so far resisted on
directly commenting on it because I think it's so obviously misguided but
since you've asked...



   - Calling 'Gold' Open Access 'pay-to-say' is plain exaggeration. There
   are many different good, high-quality Gold OA journals that offer ?0 APC
   (fee-free) publishing. E.g. Acta Palaeontologia Polonica, Journal of
   Machine Learning Research, eLife...  Furthermore, more than half of the
   journals listed in DOAJ are ?0 APC (fee-free) source:
   http://www.openaccesspublishing.org/apc2/



   - Even of those journals that do charge, the fee is small, averaging
   just $906 as per the Solomon & Bjork DOAJ-based study. Humanities journals
   like Sage Open are charging just
$195<http://www.sagepub.com/sageopen/landing.sp>



   - That post itself seems to completely ignore that Finch allows the
   Green route. So one can publish as much as one likes via that route for
   free. There's no need to 'lobby' for green OA - it's expressly allowed and
   inevitably *must* be used - we can't afford to do 100% Gold in yr 1.


'Academic Freedom' is not imperilled because not all publications will have
to be paid for by the author, free Gold options & Green routes exist and
are allowed and encouraged. I'd argue the policy actually lessens 'Academic
Inequality' because now everyone will be able to read all our outputs,
instead of just rich-institution researchers. As previously mentioned,
no-one need 'pay-to-say' as there are plenty of free options.

The bit about the British Copyright Council (no source given either) being
strongly opposed to the usage of the Creative Commons Attribution License
(CC BY) also cracked me up! Of course they would be! I doubt the British
Copyright Council would support the usage of *any *Creative Commons licence
tbh.


Green is allowed, the policy has been made, it's not going to change...

I'd much prefer if people spent their time & effort on positive,
constructive activities like raising awareness of journals that allow
RCUK-compliant Green OA, or low or no-cost Gold OA journals. This is the
action they should be taking IMO.

I fully agree with Ross. It makes no sense to criticize<http://dict.tu-chemnitz.de/english-german/criticize.html> the RCUK policy without having proper alternatives. Sure, the RUCK policy is an experiment. But we need such experiments like this or SCOAP? because other alternatives (incl. green) do not really work, especially they do not obviously change the publication system based on subscriptions so far. (To my mind, PLoS and similar gold models have been affected the system more effectively than most of the puristic "green-only-policies".)

One of the major lessons from databases like www.journalprices.com<http://www.journalprices.com/> is: If we do not want that oligopolistic commercial publishers dominate the prices for publications, public research funders, public research institutions and charities and should increase their support for cost-effective alternative models like PEERJ, Forum of Mathematics, IZA Journals, elife and others ...

And finally, who cares that publishers make profits if the costs are reasonable?



Best,

Falk

Yes.
The major infuences have been:
* the initial *idea* of "open access" (credit to Stevan Harnad, Peter Suber
and the BOAI group)
* BMC which showed that honest OA publishing can work and make an honest
profit
* the thousands of small honest OA publishers (often zero-cash) who show
that this is what many in the community want
* PLoS
* Wellcome Trust
* NIH
* RCUK
(and apologies for those I have forgotten)

All these have generated focus and shown a positive and useful way forward.
The RCUK is in a difficult position - Finch didn't give any real help.
After years of community apathy the publishing market is completely broken
and RCUK has made it clear that they want to change it. It is impossible
for them to do this without upsetting people. The major initial benefit is
not to create the system of the medium future (which no-one can foresee)
but to catalyse change - which they have effectively done.

I have serious problems with both the green and the gold approach and even
more serious concerns with hybrid gold. Green legitimizes the publishers -
it can only work if there are traditional journal subscriptions. The idea
that green will reduce prices is simplstic and there is no evidence it will
happen. It legitimizes the "possession" of content by publishers. And many
publishers (e.g. ACS) will *never* allow it. Gold will only work if the
pricing model is seriously changed. It also legitimizes current publishers
and invites irresponsible ones. I cannot see it working well without a
regulatory system. And without such a system hybrid is simply a way of
giviing publishers more money - there is no competition so no pressure on
prices.

prices which are inexcusable.

We have to separate the production process + open availability from the
academic-glory of publication. Readers do not need and I suspect do not
want what the publishers provide. Authors increasingly care about the
glory, not the actual product.

I can see how the problem can be addressed technically - I cannot
immediately see how it can be solved politically. The danger is that if it
isn't we will get a Maxwell/Murdoch-like "solution".

Subject: [Open-access] Data Policies of Economic Journals
Message-ID: <CAChagOCr0T56NSdxQ06i5H+yP-Q8biUnXZSjspuySMRAhfi7kw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I would like to draw your attention to a recent blog post at Open Economics
about data policies of Economic journals, written by Sven Vlaeminck from
EDaWaX (European Data Watch Extended):
http://openeconomics.net/2012/12/07/research-data-management-in-economic-journals/
.

The piece examines 141 economics journals to identify 29, which have a data
availability policy - 10 of which used the same or a slightly modified
version of the policy implemented by the American Economic Review (AER).
The criteria for evaluating data availability policies includes e.g. being
mandatory, pledging authors to provide datasets, code of computation,
metadata and used programs, assuring that the data is provided prior to the
publication, etc. Read the whole post for all the results of the survey.

You can also access the raw data at the Datahub: h
ttp://datahub.io/en/dataset/edawax-wp2
<http://datahub.io/en/dataset/edawax-wp2> (for
English language users: when importing in a spreadsheet editor - the csv
files are separated with ";")

The date policies of Economic journals is a salient topic, which would be
also addressed in the Open Economics international workshop next week:
http://openeconomics.net/workshop-dec-2012/, where Sven Vlaeminck will
present on the panel "Open Data in Economics ? Reasons, Examples,
Potential?, which would examine examples of open data in economics and its
potential benefits.

I recently raised this this with the open-access list, in anticipation of
precisely these kinds of criticisms [1]. Might it be worth coming up with a
brief rejoinder addressing some of the main misconceptions? Anyone up for
pitching in?

Subject: [Open-access] A sad encapsulation of why Open Access is so important
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEyV8brz_=-c9jJ78vaGtCAfKcFuecs4q30SrttYzAteBA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I thought I'd share what is perhaps a new and interesting example of missed
impact through Closed Access research publishing.

I was reading this new Nature blog post 'What were the top papers of 2012
on social media?'
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/12/what-were-the-top-papers-of-2012-on-social-media.html

and found that the 3rd most tweeted paper (cumulatively) throughout 2012
was first published way back in 1996.
Why was such an old paper so topical in 2012?

Well, the title is: "Rape-related pregnancy: estimates and descriptive
characteristics from a national sample of women"

It is not a freely accessible paper. Most people can only see the abstract
without paying more. The tweets are clearly related to this news story and
related US political issues:
http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/19/republican-todd-akin-rape-pregnancy


Perhaps Todd Akin and other public policy-makers in the US and abroad might
have benefited from Open Access to this and related research?


Am I clutching at straws here with my thinking that this is huge missed
potential for societal impact? The difference between an abstract and the
fulltext is immense - what knowledge benefits have we missed out on here
with so many citizens and *policymakers* denied full access to this
publicly-funded* piece of medical research?


Food for thought perhaps?



Ross




* The paper was "Supported by National Institute on Drug Abuse Grant
No. ROIDA05220"

Ross,

Please immediately put this message, unchanged, in a blog post or on a
Google+ page or somewhere else that I can link to it. It deserves to
be more widely read than this email list.

I'm afraid I don't have time to blog it but it's here on G+ which will
provide a nice unmoderated instantaneous comment platform for it:

Perfect, thanks.

Thanks Bjoern.

I do also like MAGNUS KJAERGAARD's apt comment on that thread:

By citing information hidden behind a $2.000 paywall, you very efficiently
demonstrate how the toll-access business model can stifle scholarly
discussions.
