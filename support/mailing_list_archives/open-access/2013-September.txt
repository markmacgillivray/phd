Hi, Joe. My apologies that Who Needs Access has been stalled recently
-- I have just had so much else going on that I've not found the time
to do more interviews. It's still the case that we're really keen to
have other people also creating articles on that site, so if you'd
like to contribute some, they would be very welcome.

I am delighted to think our site played some role in catalysing the
OAB project. Keep up the good work!

-- Mike.

Hey Sage,

Good question!

Each time I put together the update, I check the #FundFreeCulture hashtag -
so if you tweet using that tag, I should pick it up.

You could also email me directly, and I'll make sure to retweet and include
it in the update.

Finally, if it's a Creative Commons licensed Kickstarter project, get in
touch with Creative Commons (ATTN Elliot) and they'll put it up on their
page.

Cheers,
Chris

Well. It reflects the infelicitous conflation between the licensing debate (= how to get to an open knowledge society) and the APC vs. subscription tension. We are in a situation (e.g. in this list) where the latter prevents a real analysis of what we, scholars, may want as an optimal model for disseminating research results at large.

I cannot see the NSA context of CC-BY, sorry.

There was no copyright in the middle ages and a lot of fruitful plagiarism.
May I remember to my thoughts at

http://jlsc-pub.org/jlsc/vol1/iss1/5/

CC-BY-ND blocks translations and other derivative works.

CC-BY-NC blocks scholarly use in commercial context e.g. use in the most
(commercial) e-journals.

I have had in-depth discussions with both Heather Morrison and Rosie
Redfield. I think they misinterpret what CC-BY allows and what CC-NC
prevents. In science, at least, we have used CC-BY for 10 years with no
problems. The only real effect , in science, for CC-NC - is that it allows
the publisher (not the author) to make additional money from reselling
rights to the article. Thus a CC-NC for an Elsevier article does not forbid
commercial re-use- it simply means that re-users have to pay Elsevier an
additional and lucrative tax. CC-NC in science is about ibcreasing
publisher income, not about restricting re-use.

In A+H the current ethos is that authors sell their books.  CC-NC may have
a bearing on this, though it will depend on the exact details of copyright
and the publisher. In general CC-NC controls who can make money.

For those enamored with copyright licenses, the following TEDx talk is a
refreshing departure. Some industries manage quite well without copyright
protection. It's worth a listen...

Thanks for this. A very nice example, and just imagine this in a world were the clients are also the producers, like in science... let's be proud of plagiarism in an open scientific world!

This kind of thing has been happening for a while. It is a natural 
consequence of open licenses. Wikipedia has been re-packaged and sold 
many times 
<http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/04/06/wikipedia-pod-a-flooded-amazon-the-endless-spigot-at-alpha-and-betascript-publishing/>. 
While I can't find an example, popular open source software has fallen 
prey from time to time, being repackaged and sold to uninformed 
consumers who don't realize there are cost-free versions available.

I would argue this new world requires more of the consumer. Be savvy. Do 
a little google research. There's no going back to simpler times, the 
complexity is here to stay.

Here are mine (comment on article):

Just PLoS ONE alone has published almost 100k OA articles since its inception. Now editors are going through all of these articles and picking the 'best' ones for a compilation in a book. And after all of this work (that Nature editors charge a hefty fee for, pre-publication!), some people are actually concerned that the publisher charges a measly 100 dollars for such a book? Granted, Nature (with a self-proclaimed cost *per article* of 35,000 dollars) would claim their selection process is much more rigorous and 'high quality' - but one only needs to look at the retraction rate of journals like Nature to get an idea just how 'rigorous' their selection is.

Bottom line: one can complain that the way in which this particular publisher is re-using the articles can be improved, but if anything, this sort of post-publication review and filter is what we need to see *more* of, not less.

Would the affected authors be equally dismayed if someone developed the cure for a disease after reading one of these books as a means to get up to speed on that particular affliction?
I can understand the issues with form, but that doesn't mean the function is equally bad.

Everyone concerned about this practice ought to be on fire to get rid of GlamMagz and then deal with this minor issue.

This argument appears to reflect a position of technological determinism which I reject - the idea that we are helpless to do anything but adapt to advancing technology. The key problem with this argument is that it is we humans that create the technology, and we have the ability to shape it.

Another example of this kind of argument that people are thankfully beginning to question, is the idea that now that we have the internet it is ridiculous to think that there is any notion of privacy and the accompanying idea that society both can and does accept this.

Snowden's revelations of NSA surveillance are such a good illustration of the dangers of this loss of privacy that people are beginning to take notice and say that yes, we do want privacy in the online environment. Humans are not helpless with respect to this technology; we created it, and we can shape it future.

This perspective is essential to the work of advocates for open access, open science, a free and open internet. We work for this (I think) because we perceive this as a desirable potential of the internet, and we do not believe that this potential will be achieved by sitting back and watching the technology unfold, but rather because we think action is both necessary and desirable.

If you're interested in the social shaping of technology, you might want to read some of Andrew Feenberg, e.g. Questioning Technology or Transforming Technology.

Do you have any details about these discussions? I have no memory of this. Perhaps you spoke with another Heather Morrison? My name is not uncommon.

PMR, are you assuming that I am advocating for CC-NC? If so, your assumption is not correct. I advocate against the push for CC-BY as a default, and especially against forcing people to use this license. However, I am not convinced that any of the CC licenses is exactly right for scholarly works. I advocate for experimentation in this area, not requiring a particular license. My own position on this topic is expressed in my blogpost, Articulating the commons: a leaderful approach:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2011/12/articulating-commons-leaderful-approach.html

> In science, at least, we have used CC-BY for 10 years with no problems.

Do you have evidence to back up this assertion?

The majority of scientific works published in the last 10 years, to the best of my knowledge, have been published as toll access. Of the works published as open access, not all are published with CC licenses, and those that are published with CC licenses do not necessarily use CC-BY.


> The only real effect , in science, for CC-NC - is that it allows the publisher (not the author) to make additional money from reselling rights to the article. Thus a CC-NC for an Elsevier article does not forbid commercial re-use- it simply means that re-users have to pay Elsevier an additional and lucrative tax. CC-NC in science is about ibcreasing publisher income, not about restricting re-use.

This statement assumes that publishers retain copyright. I argue that scholarly authors, not publishers, should retain copyright. 

I also argue that blanket permission for commercial rights (CC-BY) is a larger problem for downstream re-enclosure than CC-NC. For example,  there is nothing to stop a publisher from removing the CC-BY copy and replacing it with one that is CC-BY-NC, or one that is All Rights Reserved. There is nothing in the CC-BY license that would prohibit this.

Consider that the world's largest OA publisher, BioMedCentral, was sold to Springer, a primarily toll access publisher, a few years ago. Recently, Springer was sold to a new set of private interests - the 4th such transfer of ownership for this company in about a decade. If a downstream owner of BMC content wanted to revert this content to toll access, there is nothing in CC-BY to prevent them from doing so. Fortunately, BMC content is also in PubMedCentral - but a for-profit company wishing to reap profits from toll access to this content would have significant incentive to lobby against public funding for PMC, and in this economic environment governments may well listen. For this reason, I strongly encourage authors, even authors publishing in fully OA venues, to also self-archive in both disciplinary and institutional repositories.   

> 
> In A+H the current ethos is that authors sell their books.

Not all social sciences, arts and humanities scholars publish books. There is a diversity of scholarly practices in this broad set of disciplines. Many disciplines and sub-disciplines are just as much oriented towards journal articles as much as the sciences. In science also there is a diversity of publishing practices - scientists  write books, too. 

> CC-NC may have a bearing on this, though it will depend on the exact details of copyright and the publisher. In general CC-NC controls who can make money.

Note that I am not necessarily advocating for CC-NC, rather advocating against CC-BY, particularly the explicit granting of commercial and derivative rights, and particularly policies enforcing the use of this license. Klaus' point about no copyright in the middle ages is a good one; no copyright may be better than the explicit granting of commercial rights and derivatives with CC-BY. For example, the attribution requirement and strong author moral rights of CC-BY are in some ways problematic for scholarship. 

One point where we might agree is that it is not helpful to scholarship to have commercial publishers retaining copyright and releasing works under the NC license so that they can retain commercial rights. Where we likely differ is our assessment of what the problem is. I think that your position is that NC is the problem. My position is that extensive commercial involvement in scholarly publishing is the problem. I think your position is that forbidding NC will solve the problem, whereas my position is that forbidding NC will make things worse. 

best,

Heather Morrison

Thanks for bringing that up Ignasi. That is one of the well known reasons why NC is not advised if one intends the work to be really open. Inability to legally mix NC with SA is a big barrier. Which is why BY or BY-SA are the best licenses.

There is a CC-BY-NC-SA license. For details, see the Creative Commons license description:
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/

This is what I use for my blog, and is the license that I recommend as the strongest protection for open access downstream. It's not perfect and I fully understand if others wish to make works open access via a different CC license, or without a CC license. "Free of charge and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions" (from Suber's short definition of OA) is good enough for me.

Note that CC licensed works do not necessarily meet this definition of open access, including CC-BY which does not necessarily mean free of charge.

Would that it were so. I am pretty darned certain that their selection
process is:
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=site%3Aplosone.org+ecology+desert

If they ARE doing more, then it's to say the least surprising that
there are no introductions explaining why the successful articles made
the cut.

Possibly, perhaps even likely - but who's to say that this isn't pretty much what CNS editors are doing when deciding what to send out for review? So in sticking with the "quality by selection" meme, that's how I put it - why use different assumptions for the same opaque process? :-)

I actually don't really care how CNS or Apple select - chances are it's useless to me (and potentially most others) either way. But if one such useless selection is touted as "the best" without evidence, I damned well can claim "the best" for any other such opaque and useless exercise. :-)

Your argument in defence of Apple Academic Press seems to be "the
other kids are all doing it". That was never an argument that
impressed my mother, and it's not working on me, either.

No, my argument is: "but mom, I only took one cookie to give it to 
little Ben after dinner, when Tom took the whole jar and ate all of the 
cookies right away! Why isn't he grounded, too?" Would that have 
impressed your mother? :-)

That's all I'm saying.

If you want to know what is *starting* to go around in my head as people 
keep pushing this minor issue, read below, but I don't recommend it :-)

Cheers,

Bjoern


--------------------------


This publisher takes my article and extends the reach of it? So what? I 
ought to be happy.
This publisher extends the reach of my work without my name on it? So 
what? It's not mine anyway, it's the tax payer's.
This publisher charges for their work extending the reach of 
taxpayer-funded research? So what? We all get paid for the work we do.
This publisher uses some of the money they charge to employ people and 
pay taxes? So what, that's what tax-funded research is supposed to do, 
at least according to the politicians.
This behavior violates the license under which the work is published? 
Well then perhaps we ought to change the license to make this behavior 
not violating it.

The more people keep pushing this issue, the more I'm starting to think 
that perhaps the right license for tax-funded research would be one 
where the authors are not allowed to be mentioned on re-use, but where 
'funded by the taxpayer' has to replace the author list.
Now there's a whole host of reasons why this isn't practicable, but in 
principle...

Just to re-emphasize: I can see why people are upset and from a 
traditional perspective their concerns are fully legitimate. I felt like 
that myself - we all have the subjective impression of ownership of our 
articles. What is *starting* to form in my head now is the suspicion 
that we might perhaps need to reconsider some of our priorities.

I don't think we serve the taxpayer by prioritizing the limitation of 
re-use. Perhaps, one of our priorities should be to demonstrate to 
authors that re-use is desirable, in *almost* whichever form.

I'm not saying pushing this issue promotes limiting re-use, not 
deliberately nor intentionally anyway, but look at Rosie's and some 
other posts: the effect this whole spat has is that people flock to NC, 
which one might consider counter-productive, or at least an unintended 
consequence? I suspect that potential competitors of Apple AP see these 
posts and discard this form of re-use right away instead of endorsing it 
and out-competing AAP (easy enough). Perhaps what we're doing here is 
even worse: perhaps we're closing the door to a whole market of 
selection and aggregation services that might evolve and would have been 
immensely beneficial had we not squelched it when it was in its infancy.

Subject: [Open-access] special issue on publishing reform in 'publication'?
Message-ID: <586643169.20130905121731@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just been invited to edit a special issue in the MDPI journal 'publications' on a topic I can specify. If I do it, I thought it should revolve around replacing journal rank (i.e., altmetrics, ALM, etc.) and other (technical?) means to transcend a journal-based literature towards a coherent knowledge-dissemination infrastructure that incorporates of course text, but also software and data.

However, I'm a little hesitant as I don't have no experience with the publisher:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDPI
http://www.mdpi.com/about/

nor the journal:

http://www.mdpi.com/journal/publications

I can see that Heather Morrison has published in there, but that's about it.

I'm also doubtful as to which authors would be interested in submitting what to such a special issue.

What do you think, should I do it? If so, who of you would be interested in contributing? If you have access to any other mailing lists or different means of dissemination, please by all means do send this around the various 'open' communities. I'll blog something and tweet it to see what the resonance from that end might be.

I'm not sure I'm the right guy, but I'd let myself be convinced to try it anyway :-)

Many thanks in advance,

Bjoern

I know the MDPI people though haven't seen them for some years. They
started with "Molecules" which is a straightforward journal for publishing
chemistry and (may be) the largest collection of OA papers in main stream
chemistry. A few years after they started I wrote to them that their
licence was not compatible with BOAI and they changed it very quickly to
CC-BY.

I use their papers as a resource for extracting chemistry but I haven't
published there. For Molecules the charge =1800 CHF ==1250 GBP approx.

I have no recent experience but believe they are a competent OA publisher.
Whether it's value for money I have no opinion. I think they are reasonably
technically competent on production, though I have found unusual fonts in
the PDFs.

So I would have no current reservations.

P.

Excellent, thanks!

Would you be interested in contributing a paper on current content-mining state of the art and what infrastructure would have to be developed to fully leverage the technology?

Yes - with the reservation that it's not easy for me to find CHF 1800.  I

Bjoern, Peter, and others:



This blog post may be relevant:



"Why I Resigned from the Editorial Board of Climate over its Akasofu Publication" = http://www.skepticalscience.com/brierly-resignation-climate-akasofu.html



The author is Dr. Chris Brierley from University College London. Climate is published by MDPI. This publisher is not on my list, but I do find it borderline, and I regularly receive inquiries asking whether it's legitimate or not. (I had a fee-waived article published in one of their journals in 2010).



So, this question may be relevant: Do you want to have your article published by a corporation that also publishes questionable climate science research?

This is a useful discussion point.

I stand by what I wrote - in the field of chemistry and materials my
analysis of the papers and the editorial board (of Molecules) seems fully
satisfactory. See http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules/editors which has
many people I know and many Nobel Laureates. The journal has been going for
17 years and I have no evidence that these people are on the board without
their knowledge.

ALL journals can have rogue papers. Some years ago J.A.C.S published a
paper on Sodium Hydride oxidation (sic)  whose argument was rubbish (
http://totallysynthetic.com/blog/?p=1903 . The blogosphere tore it to
shreds in 24 hours including repeating the experiment. No competent referee
could have allowed it through. Yet it took about three years for the ACS to
issue a retraction. I see no real difference with the current climate
science paper. Wiley published a worse one (in Proteomics, on the relation
of the soul (sic) to mitochondria
http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/feb/13/thankstocjv5040forputting).
I myself have been been on the editorial board of a journal and asked
to
review an appalling paper - I said on no account should it go through - and
it did.

So it isn't appropriate to criticise a publisher on one bad paper. Who
knows, it may even get retracted. (I haven't read it). It may even be an
appropriate viewpoint even if not mainstream.

Some publishers have complete journals which are rubbish and which break
all the rules of peer-review. One Elsevier example is
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Chaos.2C_Solitons_.26_Fractals where
hundreds of unacceptable papers have been published. But that wouldn't stop
me publishing with Elsevier. (I have stopped for other more valid reasons).

I have no evidence one way or another than MDPI has more or less
unacceptable journals and papers than any other.

For any journal I would be concerned if there was widespread documented
malpractice which had been reported and no action had been taken. And if
this were true for a number of journals from a publisher I could be
concerned for the publisher. I have no evidence of this in this case.

Thanks a lot for your info, Jeffrey! Due to your links I found a few other stories of quite ghastly papers in journals by this publisher.

> So, this question may be relevant: Do you want to have

> publishes questionable climate science research?

If I may generalize the question somewhat: "Do you want to have you article published by a corporation that also publishes questionable research?"

If I said 'no' to this question, I couldn't use any publisher! The GlamMagz (Science, Nature, Lancet, Cell, New England Journal of Medicine, etc.) have the highest retraction rates on the market, all of them have at some point published outrageous falsehoods (cold fusion, arsenic life,  Sodium Hydride oxidation, the relation
of the soul (sic) to mitochondria, etc.) and fallen for sometimes outrageously obvious fraud (e.g. Jan-Hendrik Schoen) or less obvious, but sustained fraud ( Diederik Stapel, Who-Suk Wang, etc.).
There is not a single indicator in the literature that points towards hi-ranking journals publishing higher quality research, but a few studies show some solid negative trends, i.e., indicating that one should not rely on the content of the high-impact journals. If I cut out all the publishers which publish the, say, top 20 journals for the reason that they "also publish questionable research", I'd be completely out of publishers.

So, as much as one might want to do that, it's impossible to shun the entire corporation because of some papers.
As Peter wrote: "ALL journals can have rogue papers."
And ALL publishers can have rogue journals (besides 'Solitons and Fractals' Elsevier also publishes the brilliant 'Homeopathy' - not a parody and, of course, the infamous fake "Australasian Journal of..." suite of journals).

That leaves looking at the journal. One should probably be wary of journals that do not have demonstrable peer-review (hard as that sometimes might be to establish - GlamMagz, e.g. only peer-review about 40% of the submitted articles and editors openly boast publishing articles against the recommendation of the reviewers) and that have too high retraction rates, both of which would indicate that the journal is attracting cranks.

Does anybody know if the journal 'publications' has any such indicators of attracting cranks?

Thanks!

Bjoern

OK,
Let's take this as an example of the pluses and minuses of journals.

I am not a supporter of the journal as container. We need to find ways of
assessing the article without the journal. In the current case I have read
the titles of the current articles and the authors. On a quick skim they
look worthy articles, honestly written. I would tend to trust the author's
judgments as to what they write and rely on referees to pick up possible
problems.

For reference I did an invited article for Serials Review (Elsevier) about
3-4 years ago - before I joined the boycott. The experience was awful. It
was an open access issue and (I believe) we were promised the articles
would always be visible. In fact they put them behind a paywall after a few
months. I spent about 100 emails trying to get the journal to accept HTML
as the submission format.  AFAICR there was no peer-review that changed the
article - it went in as submitted.

So I have an article in SR. No-one reads it. The JIF is a staggering 0.9 or
something (not that I care). More people have read it on Nature Preceedings
and DSpace @ cam than ever anyone did on Elsevier's pages (they don't gives
stats anyway).

So I have everything to gain by moving to MDPI. People will or will not
read the article because of what's in it, not because the publisher earns
billions USD / year. They might even make their decision because Bjorn is
the  editor and I am the  author.

Message-ID: <CABOTVX8k_MKi_zfp50Lrgq+4803dKq3dzZJ_rBwwy_MNCSmPFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm heading out to Cape Town next week with Jenny Molloy (Open Science
Working Group coordinator) to run an open science workshop alongside Open
UCT. While we're out there, we would be really keen to meet up with as many
people as possible from the Open Knowledge community!

Mark Horner (CEO of Siyavulaha) very kindly found us space for a meetup at
the* Open Innovation Centre, Cape Town*, from *19:00 on 10 September*. More
details can be found here:
http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/Cape-Town/1021072/

Come share tales of your projects and activities, and find out about what
others are doing! I'm hoping we can have a series of lightning talks, so
please let me know if you would like to talk, and I'll add you to the list.
Do circulate it to others you know in Cape Town who may be interested!

If you really can't come along and join us, but fancy a coffee on Monday or
Tuesday, let us know. We've got some free time on those days at present,
and we are really keen to use it to meet up with interesting people in Cape
Town.

Best wishes,
Michelle

I'm on the editorial board of MDPI's _Publications_.
http://www.mdpi.com/journal/publications/editors

So are some other people I know and trust, including Bo-Christer
Bj?rk, Andr?e Rathemacher, and Carol Tenopir. (BTW, the entry for me on the
editorial board web page is out of date.)

I was introduced to MDPI years ago by Francis Muguet, a completely honest
and very hard-working chemist, lawyer, and activist for OA.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Muguet

I've seen blog discussions on whether MDPI is (or is becoming) predatory.
I'm sensitive to these. On the one hand, I've seen no evidence to date that
MDPI is a dishonest operation. On the other hand, as soon as I do, I'm
prepared to step down.

In that sense, I welcome further discussion of MDPI's track record. Every
journal should be open to continual scrutiny. At the same time, I'm
delighted that Bjorn will guest-edit an issue of _Publications_.

 workshop - follow us in Cape Town
Message-ID: <CABPM+wp3qY4rLgnMVFBCUcLXzBn6cuZdvtNZ-=Wbzk-7iocvGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

The IDRC funded and OKF/OpenUCT organised workshop on open and
collaborative science for development started today at the University of
Cape Town!
You can find the original blog post here:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/07/20/open-science-for-development/
The project proposal here:
https://sites.google.com/a/okfn.org/opensciencedev/our-mission

Follow us on *#openscidev* and *#openscience* - we would love your
engagement and interaction over the next two days so please tweet back your
thoughts and comments!
We will be blogging each evening and posting summaries to our discussion
group https://sites.google.com/a/okfn.org/opensciencedev/discussion for
more in depth debate.

Do spread the word and get in touch via these routes - input and
perspectives from those in the global south would be particularly
interesting for us as we try and build a research agenda to better
understand the challenges and opportunities in applying open approaches to
science for development.

Best wishes

Jenny

Subject: [Open-access] ICAR adopts Open Access policy
Message-ID: <CA+4KT3pnaHcHs_oKKxAKMFYfGWnf9ykT1OEDr8mnKBLU3VGV9A@mail.gmail.com>

 *ICAR adopts Open Access policy*

Today (13th September 2013) the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (
ICAR <http://icar.org.in/en/node/6609>) had announced its Open Access
policy on its website <http://icar.org.in/en/node/6609>.

The full-text of Open Access policy of the ICAR is follows:
 ICAR
's Open Access Policy

   - Each ICAR institute to setup an Open Access Institutional Repository.
   - ICAR shall setup a central harvester to harvest the metadata and
   full-text of all the records from all the OA repositories of the ICAR
   institutes for one stop access to all the agricultural knowledge generated
   in ICAR.
   - All the meta-data and other information of the institutional
   repositories are copyrighted with the ICAR. These are licensed for use,
   re-use and sharing for academic and research purposes. Commercial and other
   reuse requires written permission.
   - All publications viz., research articles, popular articles,
   monographs, catalogues, conference proceedings, success stories, case
   studies, annual reports, newsletters, pamphlets, brochures, bulletins,
   summary of the completed projects, speeches, and other grey literatures
   available with the institutes to be placed under Open Access.
   - The institutes are free to place their unpublished reports in their
   open access repository. They are encouraged to share their works in public
   repositories like YouTube and social networking sites like Facebook ?,
   Google+, etc. along with appropriate disclaimer.
   - The authors of the scholarly articles produced from the research
   conducted at the ICAR institutes have to deposit immediately the final
   authors version manuscripts of papers accepted for publication (pre-prints
   and post-prints) in the institute?s Open Access repository.
   - Scientists and other research personnel of the ICAR working in all
   ICAR institutes or elsewhere are encouraged to publish their research work
   with publishers which allow self- archiving in Open Access Institutional
   Repositories.
   - The authors of the scholarly literature produced from the research
   funded in whole or part by the ICAR or by other Public Funds at ICAR
   establishments are required to deposit the final version of the author's
   peer-reviewed manuscript in the ICAR institute?s Open Access Institutional
   Repository.
   - Scientists are advised to mention the ICAR?s Open Access policy while
   signing the copyright agreements with the publishers and the embargo, if
   any, should not be later than 12 months.
   - M.Sc. and Ph.D. thesis/dissertations (full contents) and summary of
   completed research projects to be deposited in the institutes open access
   repository after completion of the work. The metadata (e.g., title,
   abstract, authors, publisher, etc.) be freely accessible from the time of
   deposition of the content and their free unrestricted use through Open
   Access can be made after an embargo period not more than 12 months.
   - All the journals published by the ICAR have been made Open Access.
   Journals, conference proceedings and other scholarly literature published
   with the financial support from ICAR to the professional societies and
   others, to be made Open.
   - The documents having material to be patented or commercialised, or
   where the promulgations would infringe a legal commitment by the institute
   and/or the author, may not be included in institute?s Open Access
   repository. However, the ICAR scientists and staff as authors of the
   commercial books may negotiate with the publishers to share the same via
   institutional repositories after a suitable embargo period.

*Implementation*

The DKMA to function as nodal agency for implementation of the ICAR Open
Access policy. The DKMA will organize advocacy workshops and capacity
building of scientific & technical personnel, repository administrators,
editors and publishers on Institutional Repositories, application and usage
of Free and Open Source Software.

*End Note*

OA initiative is not a single event. It is a process and expects full
compliance over a period of three years.  Therefore, the proposed modest
policy is a first step in the journey towards formal declaration
of openness and then after reviews progress, compliance and impact
periodically.

(my own experience of hackathons is that they often anneal in the first
hour or so of the day and commitment depends on who comes as much as
predetermined choices).

When listing the ?B? declarations on Open Access, we should add the
?Salvador de Bah?a Declaration on Open Access: the developing world
perspective?, a Declaration promoted by SciELO in 2005 which urges
governments to make Open Access a high priority in their scholary
development policies. These include:

?  Insist that publicly funded research is available in Open Access;

?  Consider the cost of publication as part of the cost of research;

?  Strengthen local Open Access journals and repositories, and other
relevant initiatives;

?  Promote the integration of scholarly information from developing
countries into the repository of the world?s knowledge.

You may include the Bangalore Declaration of 2006 as well. It was adopted
at an international workshop held at IISc, Bangalore, and drafted by Alma
swan and Barbara Kirsop.

Hey all,

We are really excited to introduce our new Panton fellows: Rosie Graves,
Peter Kraker and Sam Moore. More information can be found:
http://blog.okfn.org/2013/09/16/new-panton-fellows-announced. Each of them
will write a short blog post soon, introducing themselves and their
interests in a bit more detail.

Peter K is out at OKCon with us, so if you are out in Geneva as well,
please do keep an eye out to say hey!

This is fantastic. We've had an exciting and difficult task selecting the
fellows who had to work hard - they had to make videos and do skype
interviews. We're also very pleased that at least two other finalists are
present at OKCon and offer all our encouragement to them.

Please read the blogs because one of the roles of the Fellows is to make
new contacts, hopefully visit and talk with people who have overlapping
interests and complementary skills or resources.

My topics revolve around open and transparent altmetrics and visualizations, as well as an inclusive approach to open science. Please find me at OKCon or online (@PeterKraker) if you have ideas about that! #excited

Congratulations, you three. 

I had the joy of supporting Sophie's work, and Ross's and my paths crossed a few times as well. Let me know if you are science/data inclined, and need access to CC's resources or a contact in the Bay Area. It will be a pleasure to assist.

Subject: [Open-access] FOSsil Bank Update - 22 September 2013
Message-ID: <CAMuj-e+95kD+3ecJDP29iXa7QPMvLaYGePLyjJE9EU3E=ydJsA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,

Back to more regular updates!
Brief Survey

I didn't get a lot of responses to the first question last time, so if you
missed it please tackle it for me:

*What is stopping you from contributing to FOSsil Bank?
*When I set up the FOSsil Bank, I expected members of the community to
contribute to the catalogue. After a few years, about 99% of the 1000+
entries were added by me. I don?t resent this, but I?d like to get more
involvement from others.

Subject: [Open-access] Berlin 11 Satellite Conference for Students & Early
	Stage Researchers
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEyYCaO1y8FvVSa0D4UoTqRMvKTEx=o26vanmhfxU5G1aA@mail.gmail.com>

fyi

Thank you for your interest in attending the Berlin 11 Satellite
Conference for Students & Early Stage Researchers on November 18th,
2013 in Berlin, Germany!
Our Organizing Committee has been hard at work behind the scenes, and
we are excited to announce today that the conference website is now
online at http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11.

We are also excited to share that the conference will include
presentations from Jack Andraka (Winner, 2012 Intel Science Fair),Alek
Tarkowski (Former Member of the Board of Strategic Advisors to the
Prime Minister of Poland), Cameron Neylon, (Director of Advocacy for
the Public Library of Science), and Heather Joseph (Executive Director
of SPARC).

This exciting, first of its kind meeting reflects the importance of
students and early stage researchers as the next generation of
scholars and the impact these groups are already having in opening up
scholarly communication. The conference will convene a discussion with
leaders and innovators in the Open Access movement about the current
state of Open Access and what participants can do to be catalysts for
change locally, nationally, and beyond.

On the conference website, you can now apply to attend the satellite conference.
http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11/apply
The short application shouldn't take much time and is necessary to
ensure a diverse, representative, and active group of participants for
this unique meeting. With generous support from the Max Planck
Society, many participants will have the opportunity to have their
travel and accommodation expenses covered by travel scholarships,
which you can request directly from the application!  Applications are
due by midnight on October 14th.

You can find more information, including a complete list of speakers
and available logistical details, on the conference website.

I hope you will apply today and look forward to seeing many of you at
the conference on November 18th!

Cheers,

Nick
