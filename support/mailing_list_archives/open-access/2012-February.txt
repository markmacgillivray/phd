Yes, so they keep the price up, because dumping prices mean they don't 
have any status any more. Since when did prestige come cheap? Name one 
instance of a market, where the top-notch segment raced for cheaper 
prices? When has Rolls-Royce ever competed with Daihatsu? Even after a 
solid 8 hours of sleep, this seems to argue in my favor: we'll still 
have a hierarchy, only that this one now is based on price: worse than 
before (at least for scientists).

If you're faced with the choice of flipping burgers if you drive a 
Daihatsu or leading as lab if you loan money to drive a Rolls, most 
people will take up money, so there's zero incentive to cut on prices. 
Where would be the incentive?

That's a standard argument. Still you have Rolls-Royce and Rolex and Dom 
Perignon. This would probably be the very first time in history that the 
top brands wouldn't charge outrageously for their place at the top. 
Paying only 8k for a Nature paper would be like buying a bottle of Dom 
Perignon for a measly 60$ - price dumping!
Why should that happen when you only need 8% of all scientists to 
publish with you to make a great living? What would make scholarly 
publishing so radically different from any other market?

If your livelihood depended on a Rolls Royce, would you not do 
everything possible to get it, even if it didn't make any sense to have 
it? Today, people fake data, brown-nose editors and bend over backwards 
to get published in CNS. This will all stay that way, plus people will 
take up personal money to pay for top journals because grants won't 
incorporate these sums.
Tuition in the USA used to be less than 500US$ for in-state students in 
state-owned schools. Now some of these schools charge 25k per semester. 
And people are willing to pay that because they feel they have to. What 
makes our publishing so special that would prevent something from 
happening that occurs everywhere else? What extremely unique trait does 
publishing have that not a single other market has?

Why would Nature not be Rolls Royce and Science Dom Perignon and Cell 
the Rolex of publishing? They already are, by several measures except 
price. Which market doesn't have a luxury segment and how is it similar 
to publishing? On the contrary, hyperinflation seems to be the 
consequence of anything where public money is involved.

We should be making evidence-based decisions. So far, all arguments seem 
to be hope and wishful thinking. Where is the evidence for publishing 
becoming a unique market which will not have a luxury segment as all 
other markets?

All the best,

Bjoern

I was invited, because if libraries host our publications
and data, we have universal open access, including CC-0.

In other words, seemingly in contrast to some on this list
(pardon me if I'm mistaken), I'd like open access to benefit
both the tax-payer and science, rather than benefit only the
tax-payer and hurt science.

I joined this mailinglist after Peter's invitation, because
he expressed to me personally that he'd also be happy if we
got rid of publishers (but English is only my third
language, so maybe I misunderstood that).

I wasn't aware that asking for evidence rather than obeying
to dogma is a reason for expulsion from this list and Peter's
email yesterday seemed to indicate as much:

Maybe it was my mistake to join this list, if I'm the only
one who supports an OA model under CC-0, conforms to BOAI,
etc. and doesn't harm science in the process, then I really
don't belong here. I wouldn't want to support an initiative
that risks transforming science into a luxury past-time
for the rich, even if only as an unintended consequence.

Conversely, if want more pervasive and sustainable
open-access than the majority here is willing to support, I
should also unsubscribe.

I'm not easily offended, just let me know, it's only a click
of a button and I really wouldn't want to keep wasting your
time with my opinions.

Good luck,

Bjoern

Oh, sorry, that's how I understood it. My bad, I apologize.

I was expecting evidence for why an author-pays publishing
system should not have a luxury segment like all other
markets I can think of. Your question instead of an answer
appeared to me like a veiled "shut up or get out!" :-)

No, not at all.  My intent was "it seems that your goals are not
aligned with what I understood those of the group to be, so why do you
want to be here"?  Apologies for not being clearer.

As to the substance of your concern: I suppose it comes down to how
much you trust markets.  It seems to me that if it costs $50k to
publish in Nature of $1350 to publish in PLoS ONE, people will quickly
enough desert Nature.  Just as "the Internet interprets censorship as
damage and routes around it", so a clearly viewed market will
interpret exploitation as exactly what it is and route around it.

Also, you set up a false dichotomy of taxpayers vs. scientists.
Scientists ARE taxpayers.  Openness benefits us as much as anyone --
more, in fact.

This is an open list and anyone is welcome.

The subject is complex, and people feel passionately. I for one expected
this type of discussion and it's useful to have viewpoints aired.

I think most of us want to see something concrete come out of this fairly
soon. So while we are discussing keep in mind that it should be leading to
something. It's possible that this might initially be a document or a
policy. Personally I want to see things like tools and content emerge as
well.

Isn't that bit like arguing that Dom Perignon would cease to
sell champagne because people can get water (or Moet et
Chandon) for a tiny fraction of the price?
Or that Rolls Royce should cease to sell cars because people
can drive around in a Hyundai just as well?

And in these markets, people actually have the choice!
Scientists who want to have a job don't have a choice of
where they publish. How would that change?

champagne! lol :-)

Reasonable enough. However, what would motivate, e.g., search
committees, instead of cutting off the list of applicants at
the first one who doesn't have a Science or Nature article,
to actually go and look at the titles and abstracts of the
papers of their ~600 applicants?
Only having one Science paper made me not make the shortlist
on a number of my applications, I've been told.
How would that change?

You are correct, I was exaggerating to make a point that the
benefit of OA would be outweighed by the cost of having a
luxury publishing segment without publishing in which you
wouldn't be able to get a job.

I think that we NEED this type of discussion. for me reading Bjorn's
arguments adds to a growing feeling of us (scientists) being held hostage
by the scientific publishers because we let them.. And the way to go would
be to not let them.
In other times the publishers were wielding power, because they printed and
distributed knowledge at a price.
Now the internet allows for almost free dissemination of knowledge and the
only reason to keep going to renowned journals and publishers with our work
is because of their reputation, which mainly resides in our minds. And as
long as all scientists believe this we would have to keep publishing with
these publishers in order to be seen.
We have it in our own hands how we want to share knowledge. If we want a
future with open science and open access we need to convince people that
publishing Open Access is far superior to publishing using the conventional
publishers. We could achieve this by showing people the advantages and
possibilities of open access publishing. We could build a web portal that
offers information in an open access way: malaria researchers could form a
community where scientist share their research papers in repositories, also
share
via links to open access journals, We can develop tools for improved
sharing of information, easier access to information. We can offer direct
online communication. Ideally we would also start our own online OA
journals. If we were to form an initiative along these lines we could
attract a lot of scientists and citizens who are fed up with the system as
it is.
And let's not forget students who are looking for new ways to communicate
science (R2RC).
We need to change the system as we can not depend on publishers to give up
their lacrative businesses.
And change needs a change of attitude (of scientists) which we can promote
by way of a strong internet presence with a strong message.

Bjorn,

The fundamental problem you're describing here is the absurd level of
prestige assigned to getting a paper (or, I should rather say, an
extended abstract) into one of the tabloids.

How are you going to change that?  If we make the move to
self-publication online, or putting everything in arXiv or similar,
how will that change the predilection of hiring committees to start by
counting the number of S&N papers candidates have?

It seems to me that you're conflating two rather separate issues: the
crazy influence of a few journals; and the lack of free access to
research.  You're criticising solutions to the latter because it
doesn't (you believe) offer solutions to the former; but I have yet to
hear ANY solution to the former.  Do you have one?  Or is your plan
just to keep the current S&N system,
but make readers pay for it instead of authors?

-- Mike.

I am deliberately "listening" to this, partly because I have actually
changed my mind as a result of listening.

Bjorn's position is a very important one (and I personally have synpathy).
But we have to express if formally (more than "all publishers are evil and
should be ***ed"). I am in danger of being too emotive myself.

So perhaps one thing we should do is try to capture the essence of various
positions in an objective manner. This has the advantage that we are seen
as a rational and objective group. There may be an objectively convincing
argument for the status quo, though no one seems to be making it
convincingly.

Perhaps part of the problem with the "OA community" is that it has not
formalised positions.

P.

That would change instantly if - as you describe - publication in a
top journal became an indicator simply of ability to pay, rather than
of quality.  Hiring committees don't care about ability to pay.

This is what I mean when I say that top journals are terrified of
losing their status.  They won't do anything which deters a
significant proportion of authors.  There is a significant snob value,
which feeds back into citation counts and impact factor, but
ultimately a journal is only indispensable if it has high-quality
content.

In any case, this is a ridiculous hypothetical.  Has it happened with
the NIH mandate?  I don't believe so (although nobody has answered my
request for first-hand experience).  So why are we even discussing it?

It may be valuable for us to record current practice in "Open Access". For
example are there examples where people have been required to take-down
because of potential licence violations. Or where authors have been
forbidden to submit to a journal because of the Inglelfinger rule (not
posting work before submitting to journal). Or where the journals state
this as a rule.

I came upon two more interesting arguments for new ways of scientific
knowledge sharing at the  ResearchGate.net where a discussion is running on
the topics of Science2.0 and Open Access:

Eberhard Hilf of the Institute of Scientific Networking in Oldenburg
(Germany) writes:
"In the new digital age, do scientific journals serve science researchers?
No, they don't. And the very concept of the 'paper in a scientific journal'
does not fit the needs either anymore.Neither is it complete, giving all
the details if wished by the reader, nor is it compact enough to be easily
re-used for own research. Thus we need new forms scientific information
transfer chunks. "

and Vladimir Teif (Deutsches Krebsforschungs Zentrum) writes:
-- I can give you an example of the traditional publishing system where the
author always pays to the publisher: This is the advertisement industry.
The author of the advertisement pays to the publisher to publish the
advertisement. This is exactly what the open-access business model is.
These scientific publications are equivalent to paid advertisements, and
their purpose is mostly to advertise the work of the group to help
fundraising, not to disseminate scientific knowledge.

Dear all,

below you find some detailed answers to some of the points
raised by Mike and Nick. For those of you who are not
interested in the details, here is my question:

I'd love to see/hear examples of markets without luxury
brands and a clear understanding of what makes these markets
different from those markets with luxury brands and how
these differences can be implemented in scholarly
communication. In the absence of such evidence, why should
we hope that scholarly publishing would somehow magically
turn out different from all the other markets and push for
universal author-pays?


All the best,

Bjoern

Now we're getting towards the point that seems to me to be
critical!

IMHO, this level of prestige will allow these publishers to
charge between 10-20k per article if we go universal OA
(uOA). If comparisons to other markets are permissible (why
shouldn't they be?), higher prices are even necessary to
emphasize the distinction between the luxury brands from the
main/lower brands.

IMHO that's exactly what we keep in mind when we need to
discuss when we plot a way on how to best achieve uOA!
I see now way how you can discuss one without the other.

IMHO, author pays uOA will make the current situation worse
for the junior scientists and is thus not sustainable.
Status quo is at least not making things worse, but it's not
uOA, so it's also not sustainable. We need a third way.

What needs to happen is an erosion of journal-rank. IMHO,
uOA can only happen without journal rank, or we make things
worse than now. I'd love it if someone could make a
convincing argument against that position!

As with everything in this discussion, journal-rank has two
perspectives: readers and authors (I'm only referring to
scientists for now, as our goal is uOA anyway).

As you point out, the author perspective is the most
difficult one, and I think can only be solved after the
reader perspective has all but lost any value in
journal-rank.

In the reader perspective, journals (-ranks) allow you to
cut down on the number of titles you need to scan in order
to find the relevant literature.
If we move every single paper in the archives up until 12
months ago as well as all later gold OA articles into a
semantic library-based database that also includes as many
data-repositories as possible, we can provide a reader
experience that easily is better than PubMed, GS, T-R WoK
and Scopus combined. Nobody will use anything else anymore,
because they find things there more easily, more quickly and
most of  it with a single click. And that doesn't even
include the features that few people use now: annotation,
metrics, social tools, bookmarking, etc. Imagine total
connection of all tools and features having to do with
papers and data onto a single platform. Even the most
luddite of scientists will immediately see the value in this
and use it. Ideally I would like to see this happen with
PubMed/PMC, maybe as a way to relieve them from costs (US
would be happy, I'm sure).
Thus, it is not difficult and requires only the cancellation
of a few expensive journals by a set of cooperating
libraries to build something, every reader will love,
because it cuts down on a valuable resource: time. We use
the profits from corporate publishers to buy something that
is precious to every scientist: time. And then we give it to
them 'for free'!
Searching for literature, however, is something that (for
me) happens not too often. What would be a much better time
saver to me is an IT-assisted newspaper service where 
every single paper of, say, the last week/24h has been
filtered and sorted by an intelligent algorithm that
learns and adapts to what I click on and do with each paper.
Upon my suggestion, F1000 is working on something like this
and has an early prototype in closed beta which I'm
currently testing for them. This service would easily save
me 5-8h per week in time, once it works.
Thus, for the reader, where the paper is published, becomes
irrelevant, because the relevancy of the research has been
determined by more objective criteria.
However, even in the best of cases, there will still remain
some who still adhere to journal rank as a useful tool. For
these, I'm currently preparing an article with so far one
co-author that presents the current empirical, peer-reviewed
evidence that journal rank is actually detrimental to
science, if one evaluates several measures of scientific
quality such as citations, retractions and estimates of
actual effect size.

Once nobody pays attention to journal rank in their
selection of papers to read and knows the data on the
pernicious nature of journal rank, the author perspective
will more or less automatically change: not immediately and
probably not even quickly, but slowly and eventually. There
would be quite a long period where most lo-rank journals
keep dying off (there is some evidence that this might
already be starting due to P1) until eventually so few
papers will be published in the last few remaining ones,
that these also become irrelevant.

I hope I've made clear how they're not separate and how the
impression that they are separate may lead to unintended
consequences.

> You're criticising solutions to the latter because it
> doesn't (you believe) offer solutions to the former;

No, I'm criticizing because there is evidence that author
pays uOA not only doesn't offer solutions, it will make the
effects of journal-rank worse, leading to an overall worse
situation than the status quo..

> Or is your plan just to keep the current S&N system,
> but make readers pay for it instead of authors?

I think I've always made it pretty clear that the status quo
is not an option other than as an intermediary step towards
a scholarly communication system that works for citizens and
scientists.

Both the publishers and Rolls Royce claim their products and
services to be superior. In contrast to Rolls Royce,
publishers have their citations which they say back their
claims up. If anything, CNS should be more successful and
lasting luxury brands than Rolls Royce or Dom Perignon which
go by taste alone.

One could also say that graduating from Yale with a C, such
as GW Bush, reflects simply the ability to pay tuition. Do
you see anyone seriously dissing Harvard, Yale, etc. as
merely educating those "with the ability to pay"?

Neither Rolls Royce, nor Dom Perginon nor CNS nor Ivy League
schools are losing their status due to charging ridiculous
prices any time soon - on the contrary, being able to raise
such prices means there has to be something there people are
willing to shell out such sums for. Why should these market
forces not apply to publishing?

I'm sorry, but all this evidence seems to point towards CNS
actually raising prices in order to retain their status and
distinguishing themselves from the lesser journals,
especially if they have cheap, lesser journals themselves.
It's common practice by many manufacturers to have main and
luxury brands...

> This is what I mean when I say that top journals are terrified of

lol! CNS only publish ~8% of all submissions. Which of those
8%, many of whom will get tenure because of this
publication, will get alienated, and will it matter if you
have so many new authors who just need to publish there? Or
do you mean those 92% which desperately need this CNS paper
to get a job and would rather publish their research
anywhere else, if only they could?

I'd like to see some evidence for a market that doesn't have
a luxury brand and why this would apply to scholarly
publishing.

It's the same discussion we've always had: how to establish
uOA. I'm saying that uOA without simultaneously destroying
journal-rank will make things worse than they are now.
The NIH mandate hasn't touched the big publishers in the
least, because people need most papers within the first 12
months. An NIH mandate without embargo will lead people to
cut subscriptions and some on this list seem to believe that
the ensuing author-pays uOA is what we all want and should
push for. I disagree, author-pays uOA is most likely
pernicious, if the evidence from basically all other markets
in anything to go by.

That being said, I'd love to be convinced by examples of
markets without luxury brands and a clear understanding of
what makes these markets different from those markets with
luxury brands and how these differences can be implemented
in scholarly communication.

Does anybody have such evidence or does this discussion
have to go on using only wishful thinking and hope?

Best wishes,

Bjoern

We are arguing entirely at cross-purposes.  You are arguing against
universal publication fees, on the basis of a concern with luxury
brands (top journals).  I am arguing in favour of universal
open-access (and of taking a single step in that direction via a
broadening of the NIH mandate).

I am not in favour of universal publication fees (although I do not
think that they would result in the instant and total destruction of
science you describe).  I am certainly not convinced that a broader US
mandate will lead to universal publication fees, and you have done
little to convince me of it.  Has the NIH mandate caused a huge
increase in author-pays OA?

Your argument in any case appears to be that a broader mandate which
did not allow for an embargo (as the NIH mandate does currently allow)
would lead rapidly and inevitably to universal publication fees, and
thence to hyper-inflation of fees, the

A further request for first-hand information about the NIH mandate:
what proportion of NIH-mandated articles use an embargo?  What
proportion use 12 months?  I see that approximately half the PMC
journals are immediate open-access.  I also see this:

http://publicaccess.nih.gov/FAQ.htm#810

"Will NIH pay for publication costs?

Yes. The NIH will reimburse publication costs, including author fees,
for grants and contracts on three conditions: (1) such costs incurred
are actual, allowable, and reasonable to advance the objectives of the
award; (2) costs are charged consistently regardless of the source of
support; (3) all other applicable rules on allowability of costs are
met."

Ah, excellent point! I took this for granted, because I
hadn't thought there were any alternatives. It is indeed
crucial that we are on one page on this, IMHO.

Correct me if I'm wrong:

1. We're discussing a push for a universal OA mandate -
world-wide, not only US/NIH, without embargo?

2. If I understand 1. correctly, then search tools
would/could point to the OA version of every article first -
it's a safe link for every user?

3. If every article is available from a 'free' source, why
should a library pay subscription fees?
3a. If libraries or funders pay 'subscription' for
author-fees, what would prevent another 'serials crisis'?
3b. Am I missing something?

> Has the NIH mandate caused a huge increase in author-pays
> OA?

Probably, but difficult to judge as PLoS was founded just a
few years earlier - confounding factor. From what I know,
the rate of gold-OA journal-founding is still increasing,
but I haven't seen any hard data on it (I guess Harnad or
Suber would know these figures). Either way, causality is
always hard to establish without manipulation - or was this
the whole idea? :-)

Cheers,

Bjoern

Not sure if this means that funds can be taken out of
grants, or if NIH will add publication costs to grants. To
me this reads like you can take publication costs out of
grants. If a publication at CNS were indeed between 10-20k
as they claim, such a publication would critically impede
many research projects, as there are a lot of experiments to
be made with this kind of money. I've had grants that
weren't much larger than that!

My argument that people have to pay out of their own pockets
is only invalid, if the funder pays all author-fees in
addition to the grants, not as part of them - otherwise
everyone would just tack 20k to every grant, just in case,
and spend them on experiments if there were no such paper.

Good find, though!

Hi everybody,

There are many things that I would like to say, but I will keep it short
for clarity.
I would very much like to see a new initiative that offers an easy single
access point to papers in repositories, links to OA papers, links to ORR's
 and social networking:. all this build around interest groups starting
with malaria,, Cancer, CJD.
Bjourn states that
>What needs to happen is an erosion of journal-rank. IMHO,
>uOA can only happen without journal rank, or we make things
>worse than now. I'd love it if someone could make a
>convincing argument against that position!
I would propose that we promote the usage of an OA index where publishers
are ranked according to their OA
efforts. When readers and authors use  "our" initiative's internet portal
and find the ease of access and advantages of open access in one place,
they will start paying attention to the Open Access Index for determining
where they want to publish their work. At the same time new methods to
measure the impact of research will become more important than the citation
index, further eroding the status of big scientific publishers.
looking forward to the discussion of tomorrow!   TOM

Bjorn's doomsday scenario is predicated on the notion that markets
tend to develop a high-priced luxury option (which is true), but then
goes on to assume that hiring committees and suchlike are going to be
stupid enough to evaluate applications on the basis of whether or not
the applicants paid the premium for the luxury good.  I am prepared
(in fact sometimes impolitely eager) to attribute a lot of stupidity
to academics; but not THAT much.

Isn't the ability to attract funds to pay for research a
criterion for hire/tenure? Why should this now change all of
a sudden?

We should propose some clear agenda points for tomorrow's meeting. Please
edit/change any of this - it's to get us started.

My analysis
* a number of people are seriously interested in this subject and concerned
about changing the current situation in some way
* we are agreed on some things (e.g. BOAI- and OKD- compliant scholarship)
* we differ on some aspects and we are reformulating our ideas as a result
of the discussion. There are probably areas where we shall agree to differ.
* this should not be yet another talking shop. We are prepared to make a
personal practical effort to support this

We should therefore think about things we can do which will help the
community (including widening it) and the level of debate. As a start we
have:
* project(s) where we can collect and manage valuable data/resources in new
and valuable ways.
* a formulation of the main aspects of Openness from a BOAI-oriented
standpoint. Why are these important? What needs to change to make them
happen? Maybe state what we would like to arrive at, rather than how we get
there. I think carefully written position papers will be valued by the
community but it could involve additional research and that's costly and
time-consuming.
* development/tools that help to promote Openness both for real use and
advocacy.

None of this should prevent all of the list being full participants. If we
can create something which is seen to be useful by others then it gains us
traction. It doesn't depend on whether we are proposing revolution or
evolution.

I have copied this into the pad...

*Sharing: Culture and the Economy in the Internet Age* offers a
counterpoint to the dominant view that file sharing is piracy, analyzing it
rather as the modern form of long recognized rights to share in culture.*
Sharing* starts from a radically different viewpoint, namely that the
non-market sharing of digital works is both legitimate and useful.

Hi all,

Thanks to everyone who attended today's meeting. For those of you who
couldn't make it, the etherpad with meeting notes can be found here:
http://open-access.okfnpad.org/meeting2

A few key action points came from the meeting.

1) We need to decide on a name in order to move forwards. Send your
suggestions to the list, and I will create a Doodle poll of options.

2)  During our meeting next week we will discuss the malaria index project
(Doodle poll to arrange a time
here<http://www.doodle.com/polls/confirm.html?pollId=tup8gf98i4t8xuhx&adminKey=eycdcyqx>
)

3) Following that, we will hold a sprint to build the content for a
website. The sprint will last a few hours, and people are invited to
drop-in and contribute material throughout the sprint (Doodle poll to
arrange a time here<http://www.doodle.com/polls/confirm.html?pollId=un8kudddd2gu98pf&adminKey=34hzdzfc>
).

So, come up with suggestions for a name and fill in the Doodle polls with
your availability!

Thanks,
Laura

Hi to all,

Thanks to all present for an inspiring Skype meeting.! And to everybody in
our group for speaking their minds openly on the open-access mailing list.

I think that this initiative will eventually warrant the name Open Access
Foundation with the subtitle OpenAccess4All. See also my mindmap
visualisation that was sent to the list.

For the time being i propose as name for our group:
OpenAccess4All
OpenAccessFoundation initiative
OpenAccessAlliance
OpenAccessCoalition

I suggest Universal Open Acces or uOA, to make clear that
we're just an organisation that's meant to build on the
successes of the OA movement so far and aim to drive it all
the way.

Best wishes,

Without proposing an actual group name, I notice that the term "public
access" has gained some currency -- for example, the NIH mandate is
called its "public access policy".  Is that better or worse?  I like
that "public" makes it explicit that we are not just talking about
access for academics.  But I have the sense that it may be a weaker
term.  Could we perhaps take advantage of this alternative terminology
by position the term "public access" as a broad concept, and "open
access" as the CC-BY subset of that?

-- Mike.

I don't have a very strong opinion on that, but my gut
feeling is that the meaning of what we strive for will be
watered down with every new term. For instance, Elsevier
uses "universal access" to mean that only those get access
that Elsevier gives permission.

That would mean we have public access, open access and
universal access. Which is the one we want?

I realize that I also use 'universal' in my suggestion, so
this may not be a good idea at all.

My opinion: the fewer terms the better or people will confuse
the People's Front of Judea with the Judean People's Front
(splitters!)

Completely orthogonal suggestion (sorry I haven't been able to take part in discussions - busy with patchy internet at moment)

Network Ready Research

Emphasises the application and the why (exploiting network effects and positive feedback, low friction sharing etc etc) rather than the how. Admittedly it doesn't have the brand recognition (for good and ill) of Open Access but it captures for me the rationale behind _why_ we want things to be done right.

Cheers

I understand your reasons for liking this, but I think we will do much
better to go with one of the existing terms that already recognise and
(however imperfectly) understand.

Now I'm undecided: I totally love NRR, but Mike's argument
also makes a lot of sense to me.

Great! :-)

Nothing wrong with having more than one sound bite of course. A name for an effort, and a quick subtitle for why we care about it.

I like Bjoern suggestion and Cameron suggestion, however as pointed out,
both end up adding more words. This could go on forever. all I want is
access. How about going like similar to Peter suggested with

@ccess

And the tag line could just be

For everyone.

Mark.

"access" is far too general for a search

Yes, it's very good.  It also wins by being obviously not a
description so much as an invocation.

I just tried to register the account "ccess" on Twitter, so we could
be @ccess.  Someone's already got it, unfortunately -- though they've
never used it.  (I hope it's one of you!)

I am really excited about this - it kept me awake last night.

"@ccess" solves many of our problems.

We need to work out scope. IMO it is clearly access for everyone - to read,
reuse, redistribute [something]. We should also include creation.

It shouldn't cover everything (CKAN is there for some of that, Wiki*, etc.)
So is it Scholarship (I am conscious that I'm sometimes unconsciously fall
into being a science-ist - the equivalent of a racist). But if it's
scholarship it mustn't be a one-way process - access to academic outputs.

I think we are most likely to define it by what we do. But we should try to
scope it over the next few days.

I often find that FAQs are a good way of defining something - it's similar
to unit-tests in test-driven-development.

Hi to all,

I also like the @ccess.very much
The tagline could read

                                                         *Open @ccess for
All*

*?Sharing the results of scientific research?*

*For the description on the Website we could first state our target
audience and than define what we mean by Open Access*

*for instance: **?Today, most of the more than 2.5 million articles
published in the world ?s **24,000 peer-reviewed journals are inaccessible
to many of their*

*potential users because they cannot afford access.?*

*The solution to this problem is open access: free and unrestricted access
to scientific information for everyone: free to read, (re)use, and
(re)distribute as defined by the BOAI (ref   )
This site is dedicated to the promotion of Open Access in the broadest sense
*

*This will be done by: *

*publication of an Open Access Index: a novel way to measure access to
information*

*functioning as an Information portal on Open Access related information*

*being a one-stop address offering access to all published scientific
information organized around themes: for instance malaria, cancer*

*developing tools for easy access*

*offering novel ways of sharing information made possible by Open Access*

*building communities of scientists and citizens alike sharing information *

*linking to other Open Access  groups*

This is exactly what we are tackling on OKF-open-access where we are
looking at inclusive universal access to (scholarly) info. Open
Bibliography is central to the effort (we are creating an OKD-Open resource
for malaria and basing that on an Open Bibliography core.

We are hoping to create an approach where OKD-Openness is so fundamental
that people naturaly get drawn into using it. We want to avoid early
clashes with those who use "Open" in a less-than OKD manner. Initially
simply by omitting them from the resources.

And can I again thank Adrian for all his work on this. Without the
Principles of Open Bibliography our job would be much harder. And, of
course, the datasets that he is alerting us to.

And also thank Ross Mounce for having tabulated Open bibliographic datasets
as well tackling the problems of non-Open in hybrid journals.

Good.  Tinkering with your text:

Open @ccess for All

?Sharing the results of scientific research?

?Most of the 2.5 million articles published each year
in the world?s?24,000 peer-reviewed journals are denied to many of
their potential users because they cannot afford access.?

The solution to this problem is open access: free and unrestricted access to
scientific information for everyone: free to read, reuse, and redistribute.

This site is dedicated to the promotion of Open Access, as defined by
the Budapest Open Access Initiative.

It will:

publish an Open Access Index: a novel way to measure access to information;

provide a portal to Open Access related information;

be a one-stop resource for access to all published scientific
information organized around themes: for instance malaria, cancer

include tools for easy access

offer novel ways of sharing information made possible by Open Access

build and host communities of scientists and other citizens sharing information

link to other Open Access groups.

Much better,

 this excercise is already about content, but as Peter wrote we need to
have our purposes defined in a clear way.for me the text goes a long way in
the right direction..........

I would simplify the masthead, right back to how it was originally proposed:

I do prefer the simple version... if we are going to say more, are we
restricting ourselves to science? We probably are mostly science
oriented, but is that a decision or a state?

I've set up http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/access (if I'm write in
thinking @ is not an allowable URL character in that context).
We can change the URL ending if you prefer. Those without one might need to
get an okfn wiki login, which is a very quick process.

To get us off the ground I've pasted some boilerplate into that WG
page, and made a 'website' page with the text from my earlier message.
 Please hack on it.

Eric,
Many thanks indeed for your comment to my post [
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/wp-admin/edit-comments.php?p=3476 ] and offer
in your last para

I?m willing to assist; I can help with drafting the definition, and I can
explain lessons of experience from our community that I think will apply
directly to the problems you face.

 We have literally (in the last 2 weeks) set up a group under the OKF (Open
Knowledge Foundation) banner which is addressing exactly this. I have
copied this mail to them. OKF is Open to all and you are very welcome to be
part of this activity.

I will blog your comment and elaborate. Personally I owe the F/OSS movement
a great deal and I think the OKF philosophy is considerably informed by it.

This mailing list (open-access) is dedicated to finding a clear practical
solution. We are not prepared to compromise on the line between commercial
and non-commercial nor on constraints on re-use. We are also committed to
creating real valuable examples of Openness so that we convince by practice
as well as discourse.

If so, please, I don't want my name anywhere near his!

Yes, that's him.

I must admit that I have mixed feelings about Raymond myself.  He is
the main voice behind the Open Source labelling, which of course was
essentially a rebranding of the Free Software (free as in freedom)
that Richard M. Stallman had been advocating for many years.  Although
in mechanical terms Open Source and Free Software are very close, they
are a million miles apart in motivation: Free Software is
fundamentally an ethical and idealism movement, prizing freedom simply
because freedom is good; whereas Open Source is much more pragmatic,
and is explicitly about which way of building software tends to be
most efficient.

So his an our goals may be very similar; but I suspect our motivations
are not.  My advice would be to welcome him as an ally, but to be
cautious; and not to be surprised if we find down the line that his
and our interests diverge, maybe radically.

-- Mike.

Hi,

I have added some thoughts that Bart and I shared about the organisation of
the malaria community under the new @ccess.org site .
I have put this in the wiki like the lists of links already mentioned in my
previous mail.
For your convenience I have copied the text in this mail.:

* provide a portal to Open Access related information

** build and host communities of scientists and other citizens sharing
information


In the case of Malaria we already have a network community called
MalariaWorld and hosted at www.malariaworld.org.

My suggestion would be to link to this malaria community on the @ccess
site, and to provide access to the ORR and the user repository (papers
uploaded by malariaworld members) both from @ccess and on the Malariaworld
site.

People who want to register for the malaria community on the @ccess site
will be forwarded to MalariaWorld where they are asked to register.
MalariaWorld users should also be able to access the @ccess site directly
form the Malariaworld site. And logging in on the @ccess site as a
registered member of the @ccess-Malaria community should provide direct
access to the Malariaworld site.

Other communities under @ccess could also remain hosted on their existing
sites.

With reagards to the publication of the malaria index we (at Dutch Malaria
Foundation) think that this should also be a mirrored on both the
@ccess.orgsite and on MalariaWorld.org.

I am not sure how easy these things will be to implement, but as far as I
know it is doable.

*The Influence of the National Institutes of Health Public-Access Policy on
the Publishing Habits of Principal Investigators*

Athanasia (Nancy) Pontika

Graduate School of Library and Information Science, Simmons College,
Boston, MA, USA

*(Full text available
here<https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B3M8WbWcGihpODQ5OThjM2QtNDdkZi00MjEyLWFjYmEtZWRiMWY5ZWRkOThm&hl=en_US&pli=1>;

)*

* *

*Introduction*

The mandatory National Institutes of Health (NIH) public-access policy
requires that the NIH-funded principal investigators (PIs) submit to PubMed
Central (PMC) immediately upon publication the peer-reviewed copy of their
article, which will then become available for public access through PMC no
later than after a twelve-month embargo period. The policy has been
effective since April 7th, 2008 (Division G, Title II, Section 218 of PL
110-161 Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008).

* *

*Purpose*

This dissertation investigated the effect of the NIH public-access policy
on the NIH-funded principal investigators? publishing decisions. Four
questions were examined:

1.      Which factors motivate the NIH-funded PIs to publish in the PLoS
open-access journals?

2.      How do NIH-funded PIs perceive the NIH public-access policy?

3.      How does the NIH public-access policy influence the PIs? publishing
behavior?

4.      How does the NIH public-access policy influence the PIs? decision
to publish in open-access journals?

* *

*Methodology*

During the period March-May 2011, forty-two PIs were interviewed using Skype
TM software, and a semi-structured open-ended interview protocol was
followed. The participants were divided into two groups: the pre-mandate
PIs, who had published in one of the seven PLoS journals during the period
2005-2007 and the post-mandate PIs, who had published in the PLoS journals
during the period 2008-2009.

* *

*Results*

*PLoS Publication Drive: *There are four quality criteria that motivate the
participants to publish in the PLoS journals: (a) impact factor, (b)
publication speed, (c) peer-review and (d) articles? citation advantage.

* *

*Copyrights: *The participants do not actively manage their copyrights for
four reasons. They (a) have limited knowledge on the topic, (b) publish in
toll-access journals that comply with the policy, (c) publish in
open-access journals with limited copyright restrictions (libre open
access), or (d) ignore the journal publishers? copyright restrictions and
proceed with the manuscripts? submission to PubMed Central.

* *

*Publication fees: *The PIs pay the publication fees using the NIH-funding.
Providing that every year all articles will be published in open-access
journals, the NIH-funding does not cover adequately the whole amount of the
publication fees.**



*Comprehending the policy: *Three groups were formulated:* *(a) NIH
public-access policy is easy to understand and comply with (*n*=13, 31%)*, *(b)
PIs have assistants who are responsible for the submission and could not
express an opinion (*n*=14, 33%), and (c) NIH public-access policy is
difficult to understand and comply with (*n*=15, 36%). The complicated
parts of the policy are (a) the policy?s wording, (b) journals? licensing
agreements, and (c) manuscript submission.**



*Seeking help: *The participants do not ask for help mainly due to lack of
time. They give their own interpretation of the policy?s wording and
perform all the steps hoping that they managed the submission process
correctly. At an institutional level help was provided through workshops,
organized mainly by the grants department and occasionally in cooperation
with the library.**

* *

*Policy & open-access awareness: *

   - Non-increased OA awareness for OA Advocates (N=42, *n*=15, 36%)**
   - Non-increased OA awareness for Non-OA Advocates (N=42, *n*=20, 48%)**
   - Increased OA awareness for Non-OA Advocates (N=42, *n*=7, 16%)



*Policy & publishing habits:*

   - The policy did not cause a change in publishing habits (N=42, *n*=31,
   74%)
   - The policy caused a change in publishing habits (N=42, *n*=11, 26%)**

* *

*Conclusions*

The NIH public-access policy caused only a limited change in the PIs?
open-access awareness and their publishing habits. The OA Advocates support
immediate access to information and have been providing their manuscripts
in open-access formats before the implementation of the policy.  The non-OA
Advocates publish their articles based on quality and prestige criteria and
the journals they use to publish comply with the policy, so there is no
need for change.



The PIs have chosen to publish with one of the PLoS journals because of
their high-impact factor, publication speed, fair peer-review system and
the articles? open accessibility.* *



Although the participants validate the proposition that publicly funded
research should be distributed free of cost, some dislike the extra effort
of submitting the manuscripts to PubMed Central. The submission process may
be considered to be an administrative burden. The PIs who have
administrators assisting them with the policy?s steps have a more positive
attitude towards the policy.

Both Mike and Bjoern have good points against ESR: he has always been
an abrasive character.  He has strong and fixed political views with
which I have always differed and which now blinker him to climate
science.  Nonetheless, I enthusiastically welcome his involvement and
support.  Any collective includes some unusual, polarising, and even
unpleasant characters.  I would rather have them inside the tent,
directing their fire outwards.

In contrast, Richard Stallman, for whom I have huge respect (and with
whose politics I generally agree) sent me an email complaining about
my use of the expression "Free and Open Source software" in supporting
materials for the Science Code Manifesto, and has declined to endorse
the Manifesto (apparently because of my use of that expression in
those supporting materials).

No question, Stallman can also be abrasive!  But without having seen
your manifesto of his email, my guess is that his objection would be
to the use of the term FOSS which blurs the philosophical distinction
between Free Software and Open Source.  I suspect that if you reworded
the manifesto so that it endorsed both without implying that they are
the same thing, then he would probably endorse it.

I support what Nick has written

Membership of OKF groups does not depend on political views and is
primarily determined by alignment with the philosophical, practical and
social goals of making information Open and devising ways to do this
(within the law). I do not agree with ESR's views on climate and guns but I
respect his clear commitment to Open Source. It can be argued that a major
problem in the climate change debate is lack of Open information and that
everybody will feel enhanced by this.

By contrast I find it harder to accommodate people who use "Open" in a
shifting manner and accept a much more limited view of access - and that is
why we have set up this list.

OKF is a broad church, reaching out to many different types of community
and people. We should welcome this diversity. Among other things it
provides a greater set of views of which we have to be aware and for which
we have to prepare arguments for or against or compromise.

I agree with you that the group is open for everyone. and if we think that
ESR can have an original contribution to the open access group he could be
more involved, than just being a follower.

i remember Peter at one time asking if we knew of other people we would
like to ask for this group. I just finished reading Michael Eisen's blog
"You are Elsevier............"  Wouldn't he be a perfect allie?

The political views of RMS or ESR on other matters are irrelevant.
Constructing a definition of open access that both felt able to
endorse and promote, would however be of immense value. Their
influence is still considerable.

I didn't respond to the others, but I feel compelled to
respond to this one. Maybe I'm misunderstanding this, but
whether or not climate change happens is now a political
question?
If that is so, are evolution, gravity or the chemical bond
valid scientific concepts or political debates? Do we now
vote on whether the earth or the sun is the center of the
universe?

I don't care about anybody's politics - I do care about my
name on the same page as that of a delusional anti-science
ideologue. Unfortunately, guilt by association works and I'm
trying to prevent it, where possible.

All the best,

Bjoern

I suspect that they already are, in practice.

see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_knowledge

As set out in the Open Knowledge
Definition<http://www.opendefinition.org/okd/>,
knowledge is open if "one is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it
without legal, social or technological restriction."

In this sense Open Knowledge can be seen as being a superset of Open
Data<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data>,
Open Content <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Content>, Open
Access<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access_%28publishing%29>with
the aim of highlighting the commonalities between these different
groups. The concept is also heavily related to Open
Source<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source>,
with many concepts and processes directly borrowed (or 'ported') from
previous work on Open Source
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source>(for example the Open
Knowledge Definition <http://okd.okfn.org/> is directly derived from the Open
Source Definition <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Definition>).

Hi all,

Great progress this week. It seems that everyone is agreed on the name
@ccess, which is excellent. We also have the basic outline of a wiki at
http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/access.

The next meeting - which will be focussed on the Malaria Index - will take
place at *10am *on *Thursday 9th February. *An etherpad for the meeting can
be found here: http://open-access.okfnpad.org/meeting3. I'm afraid I won't
be able to make the meeting this week, but I'm sure it will be productive.

Following on from this meeting, we decided to have a sprint to create
content for the website. Please fill in your availability on the Doodle
poll here: http://www.doodle.com/un8kudddd2gu98pf#table

Have a good week!
Laura

Hi,

If we have chosen the name @ccess, probably good to register @ccess.org as
quickly as possible.
I understand that for Twitter "ccess" is already taken. Could we use
cccessgateway tov register a Twitter account @ccessgateway ???
Regarding content
I have put some info in the WIKI already  and I have asked some people I
know to be working with African education and science for eyewittness
accounts of africans on their efforts to get access to information.(to be
used on the site)
How is this website sprint organized? Working online on the WIKI, working
on a Googledoc , direct contact via Skype?

- if we use something different, confusion will ensue. If we cannot
get it, that is that, but we should try

Yes, definitely!

Whoever registered @ccess on Twitter has literally never once tweeted from it:
        https://twitter.com/#!/ccess

I think we should just ask that person to donate it.

If the group is accepting @ccess it's OK. I am not convinced. If I
read the string I can think on 100 things other than (libre) open
access.

I have all members of the etherpad group in my skype except Klaus who
doesn't have skype.

I have started an FAQ at http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/access/FAQs. I
often find this a good way of working out the essental Questions. Feel free
to edit.

The Malaria Bibsoup is at http://malaria.bibsoup.net  Have a play with it.

Laura - you are online so will call you as part of the call anyway.

Subject: [Open-access] Copyright on abstracts, bibliography
Message-ID: <CAD2k14O-_YzGmJ-DohRD+Mqbi4+3wQxO7SaDwTDYvYO+z6dFdQ@mail.gmail.com>

To clarify (disappointingly) some of the concerns about copyright of
bibliographic information:

   - abstracts are copyright (
   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_%28summary%29 )
   - bibliographic collections (but not the individual articles) can be
   copyrighted under the sui generis directive in Europe and elsewhere (but
   not US)
   - probably keywords, identifiers are "added value" from the publishers

In the Principles of Open Bibliography http://openbiblio.net/principles/ we
outlined core data which were believe are not copyrightable and secondary
data which we know or suspect will be actively contested by some
publishers. We should stick with core data when we create databases from
other sources. Of course any data we create is our own. We can abstract
papers and add our own keywords - this must be sufficient original that it
is clearly our work.

Hi to all,

A very good Skype meeting! THank you all.  I have added some notes to the
etherpad on topics discussed but not mentioned there yet.

I had a good look at the BibSoup malaria. I must say that I am impressed,
great job Mark!
 I makes me all the more convinced that once we go public with this and all
the index related things it will be with a big bang.
I will discuss with Bart one of these days and come back with some more
details on what we expect / would like to see implemented. I will take
action on the topic of crowdsourcing for malaria pub editing

Hi Jason

Great to hear from you! I was advertising on behalf of Simon Benjamin and
Victoria Watson who are the people behind the project, which is independent
to the OKF working group, although clearly we've been in touch with them.

I've cc'd Simon and Victoria in because I'm sure they would love to chat to
you. Incidentally, Total Impact came up in a conversation earlier about a
new OKF project to create a malaria open access index, for which we would
want certain measures of impact (cc'ing those involved in that discussion
also). In addition, valuing and aggregating scholarly conversations from
nontraditional media is very closely aligned with another project on open
disease research reports so I think a conversation between us would also be
useful! I'm not sure if it would be prudent for all of us to join in to
begin to get an idea of what is happening and then move onto specifics
another time or if it would be easier to just Skype separately, but either
way I am definitely available at some point over the next few weeks!

Best wishes

Jenny

Hi all,

I have talked to Bart and he is all in for crowdsourcing through
MalariaWorld.
Peter, could you outline what it is that they should do? Editing links to
full text, editing tags for Open Access? more?
During the meeting you said that we could approach WHO and others once we
would be ready to go public. As I recall it you mentioned an Alphaversion
for the Index to be ready in 2-3 weeks.
Do you then plan to go public once we have the Alpha version, that is how I
understood it..

It's down to the editability and that's down to Mark and the team.

I am lining up several demos of malaria.bibsoup
* a well-known Open Access publisher at start March
* a well-known UK research funder
* UKPMC
* yourselves

When demoing things to non-geeks you have to hit people in the first 15
seconds. The wow! factor. If you foul up you never get a second chance.
Bibserver is very close to that. But it can, occasionally, fall over.

Bibsoup is ready for query and display NOW. The question is - is there
enough useful stuff in the current content? can you find questions which
will excite people **in the malaria field**. If yes, then we need to start
preparing them now.

If there needs to be more info in malaria.bibsoup then it has to be added
either machines or humans or both. We cannot use textmining of content
because of publisher-restrictions. (We could do this on the BOAI-subset
once we determine it).

There a few things we may be able to do automatically:
* extract author affiliations from splashpages
* extract their cities and countries. This could be valuable as it shows
collaborative projects.
* textmine the online abstracts. I don't think there is any contractual
restriction on this so they would have to plead copyright violation.
* label the default Openness by using Ross Mounce's fantastic spreadsheet.
Thus all BMC and PLoS journals translate to open - we can add that. All
Elsevier papers (eg in Cell) are default closed. We need a symbol for
"closed by default".

So I suspect that the first phase will be human annotation. This means that
we have to have the editing tool. I can see the following strategies:
* adding links to other resources. Nice to read an online resource (could
be data, etc.)and be able to click a button and have it added to the
bibsoup entry
* annotating openness. When we follow the entry on a closed by default and
find that the paper is actually visible we can annotate it as such
* incorporate alt-metrics

Mark knows what we need better than we do ourselves :-)

So what we should do now is to discuss what we want, what's possible, when
it's possible. As soon as something is reasonably possible we look for
crowdsourcing.

For crowdsourcing there are very strong social norms. Crowdsourcers are
first-class citizens. They are part of us. Read "Reinventing Discovery".
Visit Galaxy Zoo. Look at openStreetMap. Get this right and this will take
off. The world will own the result.

But it's important to start with a good (not perfect) toolkit.
Crowdsourcing depends on doing the job at hand - not fighting and designing
the tools. We might , of course, find tool designers who want  to play that
role here. If we start to be successful we certainly will.

BTW I was amazed and horrified to find yesterday that 60% of Tawny Owls in
UK have malaria. It's in Wikpedia. But the original paper is closed
access.. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avian_malaria

Folks,

I have a new article in today's Guardian: The parable of the farmers
and the Teleporting Duplicator
        http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/feb/10/parable-farmers-teleporting-duplicator

It tries to convey the iniquity of the current publishing systems in a
rather different way from the more cerebral and reasoned approached
that we've mostly used, and may be effective in reaching some people
who are less apt to be persuaded by argument.

Hope it's helpful,
        -- Mike.

I have posted on @ccess related to avian malaria (two days ago I didn't
even know it existed):

The good news is that it will be easy to annotate bibliographies using
Mark's tools

The less-than-good news is that there aren't many OKD-OPEN articles - we
have to change this.

As I blogged earlier
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/02/12/what-is-the-use-of-ccess-do-owls-get-malaria-is-wikipedia-believable-who%E2%80%99s-alice-hibbert-ware/and
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/02/12/avian-malaria-can-bibsoup-and-ccess-help-do-penguins-get-malaria/.
The latter was depressing in some respects in that probably only about
4/70 papers were OKD/BOAI-open (I suggest we use the term Libre on this
list as it avoids the confusion with Open Access and we know here what we
are talking about.) This was from the decade 2000-2010 and we can expect
earlier papers are even less libre

Although a collection of 5/70 means that a particular resource is unlikley
to be found, we can look for material that is generically useful. I'm
assuming that in many cases the malaria community would simply need an
example of something. I'm guessing that the following could be generally
useful:
 * images
 * tables
 * graphs
 * introductions
 * reference lists (bibliography)

What I'm suggesting technically is that we can have a button that transfers
the *link* to these resources directly to the Bibsoup. That when someone
reads a paper they can click an "add a link to this image to bibsoup".
Bibsoup itself will (probably) not hold images, but this will make it very
easy to build a fully open collection. Tables and graphs can also be
extremely useful, even if they relate to specific experiements

The material might be:
 * re-used in lectures
 * re-used in newspapers
 * re-used in books
 * re-used in artistic creations
 * searchable by machine (we can do this for chemical diagrans, etc. and I
can see it being possible in gels, histology, etc.)
 * useful for student assignments

The material should always carry a back reference to the original paper
(this id more than most Open image collections have)

This is a small positive useful start. The idea will be that as people find
it generally useful they will be tempted to add more material to the
bibliography. We might even get to a stage where authors archived their
pre-publication material (cf arXiv). I'm an optimist today

Maybe we could build a lightweight (one-click?) mechanism that, when
looking as a free-but-not-libre malaria paper, will send a message to
the copyright holder  requesting that the reissue it as libre?  If
even a tiny proportion of those requests yielded results, we could use
the co-operation of the first publisher that helps to shame all the
others.  Then hopefully we'd be able to build some momentum towards
liberating the majority of the relevant works.

Good idea. It requires extracting the email of the mots responsive author.
This isn't now normally visible. In any case it may be valuable to
personalise it.

What we might also do is to mail authors **as soon as a paper comes out**.
They are still likely to have the pre-review manuscript. If there is a
simple way to (a) deposit it and (b) mark it as Open then we might get a
surge of contributions. A few publishers ( e.g. ACS) refuse to publish
material that has been pre-published but there is nothing to stop people
publishing their own manuscripts.

It's probably not as trivial as it seems. But:

"We are delighted to see you have published in XXX. Most of the world does
not have access to the final version of this paper. Many of them would find
your submitted manuscript valuable. Our site (yyy) allows you to upload the
manuscript to a site that everyone can see. You retain copyright, but make
the manuscript available as CC-BY so that everyone can re-use the material
as long as they attribute you."

If we even got 10 percent that would be a big achievement and get huge
publicity. Of course it hasn't had the holy peer review.

Hi all,

I liked your blogs on @ccess very much. Well done Peter. And your article
on open access was class storytelling also, Mike.
Regarding the ongoing discussion on content. I do think it  a priority to
have as many links as possible to* full* content, by promoting archiving of
papers with @ccess, by linking to open access articles, by using the Open
Access Index as a means to influence the public opinion and politicians.
Especially for scientists access to *complete* articles and data
is compulsory, but I guess that for "laymen" illustrative pictures and
abstracts would be sufficient. The database should be useful for all.
Regarding the lack of peer review. Once preview papers are deposited wirh
@ccess nothing can stop us from using new ways of review and impact
assessment with the help of the respective scientific communities. So I
would see a role for the MalariaWorld community in reviewing / ranking
papers and for our initiative to use new tools for impact assessment like
pageviews, social media buzz etc. I think that the scientific communities
will prove to be very able to review their members work and improve on it,
if our gateway gives them the tools and access to each other and to
(scientific) information. I am confident that @ccess can be a catalyst
towards networked scientific communities, a source of information for
non-scientific communities and a means for communication between scientists
and citizens. That is new compared with for instance ResearchGate.
When I see that ResearchGate .is very successful, so will we !

TOM

Thanks, appreciated!

BTW., at about the same time I was also able to place an article in
the Independent:
        http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/02/09/the-future-of-academic-publishing/
so we have reasonably good coverage of the issues in mainstream UK
quality press.  I did try to interest the Telegraph, too, but no reply
from them yet.  (I might try again: I am not going to run out of
material for opinion pieces any time soon :-)

I always get nervous when I see this sort of scientist/layman
distinction, and I think we should work to eradicate such a boundary
as much as possible.  (I was a layman myself until a few years ago,
and would have hated to be fed a watered-down version of research
while an elite priesthood of scientists got the Real Stuff.

Would there be a role for leveraging F1000 Research, arXiv of Nature

In addtion to my comment below, I found  a very useful article on Dutch OA

But I think that much of the real stuff is difficult to comprehend even for
specialists. so it could be useful to also create a possiblity to go to
abstracted content, by way of choice.

I agree with Mike, and Gilles Frydman makes this very clear - this is for *
everyone*. If someone or their friends/family is suffering from a disease -
especially a rare one - they have every incentive to become an expert.

Specialists retire or change jobs or take a break and they get cutoff from
acaemic publications. People outside academia often know MORE than those in
it - naturalists, social workers, business people, politicians - whoever.
We need these people.Medics may not be statisticians.

I want to make clear that of course I do want Access for all to ALL CONTENT.
My mail was mainly suggesting that we have to consider the (education)of
the end user. Scientist doing research will need to read more details and
others could  possibly make good use of easy links to a WIKI in order to
follow the content of a particular paper.This is what Bibsoup should also
provide I think.
I am also the first to admit that people not from "the field" can
contribute in most unexpected ways to specific scientific projects

OK, sorry to have misunderstood you.  Access to all materials for all
people, and let each use what he or she finds most useful.  Good.

When I blogged my examination of Avian malaria I found 2/70 papers which
were obviously BOAI-compliant and about 13 more which were readable. It's
possible that a few of these are BOAI-open, and I didn't mean to imply that
all 15 have satisfactory licences. I guess that most of them do not even
have a licence of any sort.

The only positive aspect is that this is initially a per-journal problem.
For example I find:
J Wildl Dis. <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17984251#> 2007
Oct;43(4):567-75.
has visible content - I can read it.
But If I want to use it in course material then I have to purchase this
from a rights management company.
This is therefore NOT BOAI-OPEN and not acceptable to @ccess (reading is
not enough)
I think it will be useful for us to gather information for re-use by
students as well as subscription prices. I think if we can show students
that they are having to pay through their tuition fees for published
material we may generate some interest.

I'd like to reinforce this point. As a translator and editor I very
often deal with unfamiliar topics and need to get up to speed quickly
with the language and jargon typical in a field. It is a major
frustration in my work that the most authoritative work is locked up
behind paywalls. Typically I need to briefly access one key term in a
handful of articles to understand how it is used in the field. As the
prevailing rate for technical translation is around $0.12-0.20/word,
accessing 3 or 4 articles at $30 each to check a single term is
completely unfeasible. But that would be the best way to ensure high
quality. I find paywalls vexing precisely because dumbed down
popularizations are useless to me.

The point more generally is that neither the author nor the publisher
can possibly conceive of all the potential ways that a scholarly work
might be useful when it is freely available. If the scholarly
literature could be treated as one vast linguistic corpus, I am sure
that interesting developments in scientific communication,
terminology, and translation would follow, for example.

This is a brilliant example of how people don't realise the different uses
to which articles can be put.  What percentage of a domain do translators
need? For example if we got 10% of all papers is that likely to be enough.

Another similar requirement is my own field of computational linguistics.
To train machines to interpret text you need a marked up corpus. For that
you absolutely have to have BOAI material - reading free through a paywall
is useless. It needs to be redistributable

Exactly right. I think we should try to collect as many different types of
example as possible.

And of course translation is a commercial activity so CC-NC is useless.

She quotes from BOAI, which is clearly (from her own quoting)
describing a regime compatible with CC-BY, but asserts that her own
CC-BY-NC-SA blog complies.  Despite this, from the BOAI: "By "open
access" to this literature, we mean its free availability on the
public internet, permitting any users to read, download, copy,
distribute, print, search, or link to the full texts of these
articles, crawl them for indexing, pass them as data to software, or
use them for any other lawful purpose, without financial, legal, or
technical barriers other than those inseparable from gaining access to
the internet itself. The only constraint on reproduction and
distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain, should
be to give authors control over the integrity of their work and the
right to be properly acknowledged and cited."

I am not suggesting that we need to do anything in response to this --
because of Heather's odd choice not to allow comments on her blog it
rarely generates a lot of buzz -- but to illustrate the magnitude of
the difficulty we face when even so committed an OA advocate as her
can make such a mistake about licensing.

So I am more and more thinking that before we plough too much effort
into trying to get people to change their licensing terms, we have
some work to do just getting them to say what those terms are: see for
example this on Elsevier's "sponsored article" terms, which despite
having been brought to the attention of both Alice Wise and Tom Reller
has yet to receive anything resembling a meaningful answer:

Dear Douglas

Thank you for sharing an excellent example of why NC doesn't work and those
outside academia need access to full articles.
We're planning to compile profiles of people with problems like these to
illustrate the importance of access for everyone, would you be willing to
participate?

I'm not sure what format we'll go for yet but it would involve a short
profile or interview and shouldn't take too much time.

I have found this in trying to work out what I can and can't do about
text-mining and get responses (this from Stevan Harnad) "data-crunch green
OA as much as you like". This is a meaningless, semi-illiterate response in
that text != data and no wild assurancies free you from legal constraints.
So in my experience the "Green" branch of OA is riddled with
inconsistencies, lack of information, etc.

My suggestion is that at present we:
* list the advantages of formal @ccess-compliance
* provide stories of user success and frustration
* discover more @ccess-compliant  resources
* build automated ingestion and annotaion

So I think we should concentrate on the positive and only change the
details of current practice where it is likely to succeed. For example we
might prepare a universal approach to mailing all non-compliant publishers

Don't forget the web content sprint tomorrow from 2pm! We can hopefully get
some good things together on this.

>* discover more @ccess-compliant  resources
>* build automated ingestion and annotaion

While we're discovering more at ccess compliant resources, it might also be
good to combine some of the tools, ideas and data we already have to create
a database/permissions clarification request service (along the lines of
isitopendata.org) called isitopenaccess.org?

We could load it with as extensive a list of journals as we think
appropriate, input all the data from Ross' spreadsheet on permissions and
attempt to crowdsource more. There could also be a IIOD? style button so
the publisher can be contacted regarding unclear policies.

This would eventually allow faceted browsing by license/permission. It
performs a different role to the OpenBib based service at the article level.

It wouldn't be a trivial exercise but I think it could be quite useful as
it seems that at the moment it's not easy for scientists when deciding
where to publish to work out exactly how open access different journals
really are and it could be a helpful selection tool without forcing people
to visit every journal website individually.

Does anyone think this would be worthwhile and/or used? I'm really keen to
get all the great work Ross did more visible than on the googledoc where it
currently resides.

Hi all,

As was discussed during our latest Skype meeting I have talked with Bart
Knols on how we would like the database to be structured  and on the making
of a first Open Access Index for Malaria. Yesterday I had an over 2 hours
Skype meeting with Bart and  Ingeborg van Schayk who is the director of the
Dutch Malaria Foundation.
As a result we will send  Mark  a list of all that we could think of in
terms of biblio Fields and editing possibilities.that we found useful.

We have come up with another additional idea. The MalariaWorld already has
a extensive database of malaria literature for 2010-present.. In this
database it is indicated which refs are Open Access, in some cases there
are links to full text. All refs have mentioning of corresponding authors
email addresses.
Would it be possible for  Mark to make a Malaria Bibsoup for the years
2010+2011 from your big Pubmed extract, and also make a Bibsoup from the
MalariaWorld database for these years.? What format would you need to be
able to do it? We could then compare the overlap in references (ideally
100%)  and apply the OA Fields in the MW Database to the corresponding
references for the Pubmed derived Bibsoup. It would allow us to make the
malaria index for those 2 years rather quickly, Open Access Index for
Malaria 2012 based on the publications for the years 2010-2011. We could
also see within a relative short time what the publisher and journal
ranking looks like for this most recent 2 year period. The comparison of
the MalariaWorld and the Pubmed Bibsoup could serve as a kind of control
for the followed procedure of extraction from Pubmed.
We have come to think that the interesting period to cover for the Open
Access Index would consist of the last 10 years,  5 periods of 2 years..You
could probably make (sub)databases for these periods in a rather
straightforward way and see how many publications there are in total.
The editing of all these references by way of crowdsourcing would be the
next step. According to Bart the idea will generate enough enthousiasm in.
the MalariaWorld community to get it done fast  Of course we will need
editing possibilities and proper instructions for the participants.
We at MalariaWorld see the making of a Bibsoup Malaria database as an ideal
community project . In our view this Malaria database would be 'de facto'
made by the Malaria community and for the community, ideally giving access
to the full content of all malaria related articles, be open to everyone
and be managed by the community( actualized, edited etc)..

One other important issue. We have been discussing the practical aspects of
a Malaria Bibsoup as a product of collaboration between OKFN and
MalariaWorld. In my emails and in the open access WIKI I have proposed a
structure where the MalariaWorld community will be of the many communities
under @ccess, but that @ccess will not be hosting these communities on OKFN
servers.  Instead the existing platforms including websites will be linked
to from the @ccess website, where there could for instance be a
introductory page + button for access to MalariaWorld. In this way all
Malaria interested people would go to MalariaWorld for access to the
malaria database, contacts , discussions, social networking, collaboration
etc. For contacts *between* communities @ccess could provide the platform.
This will be very important for cross-fertilisation between groups. For us
this means that we would like to see the* malaria Bibsoup hosted by the
malaria community* (and the carcinoma Bibsoup by the carcinoma community
and.so on).

Our (MalariaWorld's) pertinent question is what you think of the networking
structure for @ccess and people communities running their own Information
servers as I have proposed in the open access wiki/website and explained in
more detail here in this mail

For me the most exciting slogan is "Make all research results CC-BY
(and the data CC0)!" This is was BOAI and Bethesda/Berlin means today.

I am wondering how to find out how many scholars (not only scientists)
world-wide have used a CC-BY-license in at least one article they
published.

849 journals have the SPARC Europe seal in DOAJ, all using CC-BY:
http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=sealedJournals&uiLanguage=en

In 2011, PLoS One published about 14,000 articles, all under CC-BY.

What we can also do is publish counts of co-authors, etc. "Who are PMR's
co-authors ?" Bibsoup can already do this

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEx9wkjVjdVfppj92y69-cRW7t46NC5jjcx9pLOTHjuGnA@mail.gmail.com>

I've been lucky enough to be invited to help write a book chapter on
the theme of collaboration, code, and data sharing.
Thus the Panton Principles, Science Code Manifesto and other such
things immediately came to mind...

But, having looked around a few papers that have already cited the
Panton Principles
e.g. these http://www.citeulike.org/user/rossmounce/tag/cites_panton_principles

I'm a bit confused, because most have cited it as just a website, yet
there are four authors clearly listed (PMR, Cameron, Rufus, John)! So
um... it may seem a very simple question but...

A) How would you recommend I cite this?

B) Perhaps once a recommended format is decided upon, could we put it
up on the Panton Principles website, to make it easier for others to
cite? e.g. a 'suggested citation format'

Some example citation forms I've seen so far include:

Panton Principles, Principles for open data in science,
http://pantonprinciples.org/
Panton Principles for Open Data in Science: http://pantonprinciples.org/
Panton Principles Web site http://pantonprinciples.org/
Panton Principles - Principles for Open Data in Science

Thank you for  answering this initial question quickly and clearly. I note
that you are "Director of Universal Access". As you may know I have found
it almost impossible to get timely and useful information from Elsevier.
Can I assume that Universal Access offers a formal contact point where
readers and potential authors can expect to get questions on contractual
and legal issues answered. Can I also assume that the Office of Universal
Access was responsible for the document:
http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/intro.cws_home/contentmining and that if I
direct questions to your office I can expect replies.

The manuscript that you agree is Public Domain contains the phrase:
*"
*

*Footnotes*
*This is a PDF file of an unedited manuscript that has been accepted for
publication. As a service to our customers we are providing this early
version of the manuscript. The manuscript will undergo copyediting,
typesetting, and review of the resulting proof before it is published in
its final citable form. Please note that during the production process
errors may be discovered which could affect the content, and all legal
disclaimers that apply to the journal pertain.
"
*
Could you indicate whether this phrase originated in part or whole with
Elsevier. It seems very unlikely to have been written by the author - he
does not have "customers". It seems unlikely that the NIH's Pubmed facility
has inserted this as the phraseology "our customers" seems out of place.

Therefore I am assuming that this "unedited manuscript" actually contains
material inserted by Elsevier. Could you indicate whether Elsevier
"requires" authors or Pubmed to insert additional information or
phraseology into the "author's manuscript".

I would also be grateful to know what "Universal Access" is, and where it
is defined.

Peter Murray-Rust

I have copied this list into a reply from Elsevier on the GOAL list. This
gives us an important source of BOAI manuscripts

When authors deposit their pre-publication manuscript under green open
access the copyright resides with the authors not the publishers. In the
case of the US government there is no copyright. That means that if we
discover these manuscripts we can immediately label them as CC0.

There seems to be a stock phrase which Elsevier requires to be inserted.
This allows us to search for and verify that this manuscript is not
Publisher copyright. It is probably part of the mechanics of author-self
archiving in repositories. Here is an example:

http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~sxs98ltb/chambersLobbButlerHarveyTraill.pdf(nothing
to do with malaria)

Now we cannot redistribute this but what we can do is ask repositories to
add buttons encouraging their authors to licence their manuscripts as
CC-BY. This would be a huge step forward.

Self-deposition appears to vary between 8 and 80% in Belgium. If we can get
the more pro-active universities to agree this concept we could make those
institutions CC-BY. Let's think out the details and then start pushing the
idea.

P.

I am afraid that I may have given the wrong impression that I like to make
a distinction between scientists and 'others', and that the full content of
scientific articles is mainly interesting for scientist. I hereby once
again want to make clear that I do not think along these lines. For those
of you who haven"t seen my corrective response (and Mike's answer to it)
yet, please read it below.

I am touching on this subject again because I see that Peter has used this
part of the correspondence from the mailing list in his blog, commenting it
as follows:
[>>Regarding the ongoing discussion on content. I do think it  a priority
to have as many links as possible to* >>full*content, by promoting
archiving of papers with @ccess, by linking to open access articles, by
using the >>Open Access Index as a means to influence the public opinion
and politicians ]* *
*>>*Especially for scientists access to complete articles and data
>> is compulsory, but I guess that for ?laymen? illustrative pictures and
>> abstracts would be sufficient*.*
*This is a brilliant example of how people don?t realise the different uses
to which articles can be put.*
*[*the lines between brackets fronm the same post were not quoted in the
blog but they state clearly my preference for full text*].*
*
*
The "I guess..." was a reaction on PMR's mail message on the scarcity of
libre material on a specific area of malaria research where Peter wrote
*Although a collection of 5/70 means that a particular resource is unlikley
to be found, we can look for material that is generically useful. I'm
assuming that in many cases the malaria community would simply need an
example of something. I'm guessing that the following could be generally
useful:
 * images
 * tables
 * graphs
 * introductions
 * reference lists (bibliography)*

This I have taken as a hint of the usefulness of abstracted material
instead of the in most cases (unavailable) full text article.and so my
reaction was simply aiming at this.What I meant to convey was that I
thought additional material could be very useful to *facilitate
access*especially for non-scientists.  What I did not realise  was
that my
reaction would be initially interpreted as patronizing and seemingly
pleading for restricted access for "laymen"..
Enough is enough, we now have got a fine example of a wrong line of
thinking out of this episode and I have hopefully been able to clarify my
real beliefs in this matter

Hi

Peter, this may be interesting in the light of your message: there is a
good source of information on OA repositories in the Netherlands
 article on Dutch OA repositories
http://wowter.net/2012/02/10/a-census-of-open-access-repositories-in-the-netherlands/


I sent it it to the open access list a few days ago but you may have missed
it because there are so many emails coming in.

"US government agencies may claim copyright abroad
While US government works generally are in the public domain in the
US, they may be protected by copyright abroad. The feds may claim
copyright protection for US government works in other countries
depending on how those countries treat their own government works. So
just be aware that US government agencies sometimes claim copyright in
their works outside the US."

Publishers own the copyright of the work not of a version.

Tom,
Don't worry - At the start of a new project everyone makes mistakes and I
should probably have been clearer. It settles down very quickly. Mail lists
have limitations over real-life meetings and tend to have a small amount of
discourse which gets interpreted in different ways by different people.

I apologize for any unintended misrepresentations.

Please clarify with regard to the particular case. This is my ignorance.
Are you saying that the AM (author's manuscript) and the VoR (version of
record) are the same work? And does the publisher actually hold the
copyright?

I don't see any copyright statement on

I cannot say anything on US copyright but from the viewpoint of German
law the protection refers to a work. AM = VoR in respect of copyright.

Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMZsqfy38qhB_FYXhOPMPwvB607T0WKDdCV6u=EWOgwobA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We had planned to have a sprint this afternoon to create content for the
open access website. Unfortunately, all okfn etherpads are currently down.

If people feel strongly, we could go ahead with the sprint using a
combination of GDocs and Skype. However, I propose that in the
circumstances we *delay the sprint until tomorrow afternoon. *Could you
please send a quick response to this message if you are able to join the
sprint today, but can't make it tomorrow?

In the meantime, I will get the website set-up. Is everyone happy with
www.open-access.okfn.org as a website address?

Cheers,
Laura

Mike,
The hole has been there for years. Green OA guarantees only that somewhere
on the web by some unspecified mechanism a human can get photons from the
article. There is no right to download (Pubmed forbids anything other than
reading). there is no right to re-use.

Stevan Harnad is very happy with this state of affairs. If all articles
have "his" Green Open Access. I disagree but there is no meeting of minds.
Since Green OA means acquiescing to publishers rather than fighting for our
rights it's the easy way for universities to go.

I am conscious that if I deliver too many shocks to your system you might
have a seizure but be aware that almost nothing in Institutional Reposities
is BOAI-compliant. Most is unlabelled. Much is Green OA

Thanks - very useful.

In the present case it would then be a case of asking the US government
dept to provide a licence for use. If they couldn't then we should take it
up with them. But I'd be surprised if by now they didn't have a CC-BY/CC0
policy

hi,

Fine by me.
I have put suggestions for content and structure on the                    *
wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/access/website*
PMR also put a FAQ there at  ....   * access/FAQs*

Please edit and add content there if you have time.

Webaddress  I thought we had agreed on the term @ccess and that we would
take the domain "ccess.org"in order to host the website as @ccess.org ???
I guess you coiuld put it as  www.open-access.okfn.org as long as we do not
have the domain or better still use www.access.okfn.org

Some universities are pro-BOAI - Stirling (my old employer) is good on this.

I think a table of UK repositories and their Openness would be very
revealing. If we had a Openness Index that would be great. It's probably
the same amount of effort as doing the publishers. And hopefully some of
the univs would be shamed.

And we can send out FOI requests as to WHY they chose the licence. And put
those up on the site.

Side question that relates to this that I was asked today:

Has anyone done article level page-rank style analysis across a good proportion of  a significant corpus. I know that both Eigenfactor and the MESUR project were talking about doing this but both have to some extent been distracted into other things. My answer was - this would be trivially easy if we had the citation graph. Has anyone got any good pointers on the most recent work on this space and the limitations of what we can do with the available citation data?

If any of you meet me in a bar remind me to tell you an interesting story about Opus and its licensing arrangements that illustrates the depth of the problem?.

Are you aware of the EU repository policy papers and the information on
Openaire/
http://www.openaire.eu/en/support/copyright

In most cases, authors grant permission by *signing over copyright *to the
publisher. This gives the publisher the full rights in and control over the
article. Consequently, if an author wishes to reuse the article at a later
stage, e.g. to make the work available in Open Access, he/she will have to
ask permission from the publisher to do so.
Alternatively, authors can grant the publisher a* Licence to
Publish<http://www.openaire.eu/en/support/copyright/284-what-is-a-licence-to-publish>
*. With this agreement, authors can retain copyright and the right to
deposit the article in an Open Access repository, while providing the
publisher with the necessary rights to publish the article.

As far as I can tell the EU Openaire repositories are BOAI compliant

I would use the standard website citation style for the journal/publisher you are working with. If you wish then add the author names but something along the lines of:

> Panton Principles, Principles for open data in science, Murray-Rust P, Neylon C, Pollock R, Wilbanks J, available at http://pantonprinciples.org/ [accessed date]

The OKF does a lot of work in this space - I've copied Laura James in case
she knows.

Part of my problem is I didn't know what manuscripts we were dealing with -
I thought they were pre-peer-review. I think I was wrong.

Subject: [Open-access] How to cite the Panton Principles?

I certainly think a standardised suggested citation would help.

It would make it easier to track the future [citation/altmetric]
impact of the Panton Principles, rather than totting up all the scores
for a 100 different citation variants - harder to do (this happens a
lot with references to software programs I've noticed).

Sadly, very few researchers I encounter have ever heard of the Panton
Principles (yet), and thus I think it may be important to demonstrate
that we *do* have impact (even if it would generally not be formally
cited), beyond just the list of names that have endorsed it.

Also, it would help to demonstrate it's not just a 'random' website
with someone's personal philosophical views on it. (perhaps?)

Also, I think the author names give it a little more credence IMO.


That's my opinion on it anyhow...

Ross

Great news! Etherpads have just this moment been fixed. I have created us
one here: http://open-access.okfnpad.org/website-sprint

Join the etherpad as and when you are able to throughout the afternoon and
you can contribute to the website. Make sure you add your Skype ID. I
propose we begin with a brief call to get us going, how about at 14:45 GMT
(i.e. in about ten minutes)?

I think this issue has been raised before for both PP and the OKD, but
clearly nothing ended up going on the website :)
How does Cameron's suggestion sound to everyone? If people are relatively
in agreement then we can put that on the website.
We could go through numerous other possibilities but I think as Ross says
that getting something standardised up as soon as possible is probably a
good thing to do!

You may be more versed in these matters than I, but at last
year's Open Access week here in Berlin, I heard a lawyer
emphasize over and over again in his presentation that
German "Urheberrecht" (the right to the 'work') is nothing
like 'copyright' and that it is currently not solved how US
copyright and EU law can be made to agree with each other.

I went away from this talk thinking that nobody has any
strong legal case against any EU author who does something
with their own work, due to this unresolved conflict, but
things may have changed since then.

Hi all,

A basic website is now up and running at http://access.okfn.org/.

It seemed simplest to create the site on the OKFN blogfarm in the first
instance. I'm not an expert with domain names and re-directs, but I'm happy
for that url to be changed/linked elsewhere as  appropriate.

To edit, you first need to request privileges from me. (Jenny, Peter and
Tom O. already have them). Drop me an email with your username on the okfn
site (register at okfn.org/register if you don't already have one) and I
will give you admin privileges. To add/edit content, you then simply log-in
at access.okfn.org/wp-admin.

The site is functional, but it would be great to make it sharper, clearer
and more comprehensive over the next couple of weeks. Thanks to everyone
who joined the sprint today, we made a great start!

Kind regards,
Laura

I have blooged on it in German shortly at

http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/64976035/

For the Open Access Tracking Project in Connotea I have choosen the
tag oa. at access (beside oa.new) and tagged website, mailing list, and
the first blog entry by PMR with oa. at access. If you are publishing
something on @ccess don't miss the opportunity to inform the OA
community via the Connotea feeds (especially with the most readed tag
oa.new).

I think the idea was to register and redirect from ccess.org if that could
be arranged while the domain is still available!
Have we had any luck contacting the owner of @ccess on Twitter?

I thought someone had said they would but I may have imagined that so yes -
please do!

They haven't used the account Peter so it shouldn't be too much of an
inconvenience to allow us to use it.

Will do.

I don't have a clever plan.  I am just going to send him/her a private tweet.

Nothing, really -- just gives the ability to Tweet from (and be
Tweeted to at) that name.

Hi,

I have taken out the detailed information that I had put in the OKFN WIKI
for the website because we (Malariaworld) don't want the whole world to see
at this stage how we are going to make an index.
The WIKI is online accessible for everyone so I thought it prudent to take
the INDEX info out.
I propose to do our work on the making of the index by discussing it with
the small group of people that we have and not put anything concerning the
index online for the world until we are ready to go public with it.

Hi Tom,

I do understand your concerns.

I just thought it was worth mentioning that there is an online archive of
everything that gets sent to this mailing list. It's not publicly
searchable as far as I'm aware (i.e. I don't think a Google search would
turn it up) but if someone went looking they would be able to access it.

Just a heads up,
Laura

hi Laura,

As I recall the mailings we had concerning the Index before the start of
the official mailing list have not been archived after discussing the need
for secrecy.
The WIKI is free accessible to everyone so we should not put details on the
I"making of" the NDEX there, nor on the Website.for that matter.
I think it would be best when Ross, Mark and myself would work offline (ie
not via the oa list) on the making of the INDEX..
In the sprint yesterday you mentioned that someone of the group would have
to take responsability for the @ccess site. I am willing to do that. Unless
somebody else wants to volonteer?

Correct. Emails that are sent to multiple individuals are not archived
(i.e. all the early emails, before the list was created). Emails sent to
open-access at lists.okfn.org are archived. Just thought I would make sure
that everyone is aware of that whilst we are discussing issues of
privacy/secrecy.

We appreciate that there are issues which should not be public but they are
relatively few (if there are a lot it may not be appropriate for OKF, but
that's not true here).

You should assume that everything in the project is public.

There will be some times when we need to mail a small number of people in a
closed group but these should never lead to an extended chain of mails. We
should avoid mails that are deliberately hurtful to people but robust
criticism is often needed

Subject: [Open-access] Response to Hargreaves proposal on copyright reform
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Nu2YoM8OqmT-X96-Br86CBrWgFWxpCju946yyJ1ehCmA@mail.gmail.com>

Ben Hawes from the Uk's Intellectual Property Office (ipo.gov.uk) picked up
my blogging on problems of textmining and invited me to IPO in Bloomsbury -
we talked for about an hour. Ben is formally neutral but wants to see
cogent arguments from the Open community that can be included in a
response. Briefly the Hargreaves report has recommended changes to UK
copyright law which inter alia would allow text- and data-mining for NC
uses. (The NC comes from European law - if we feel strongly (as I do) then
it's worth pursuing it).  The response will be collated by IPO, offered for
public consultation and then drafted for legislative changes.

I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE OKF RESPOND - we have till March 21. - see
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-2011-copyright.pdf

Although this is a UK activity it will probably have important impact
esleweher in Europe which - as far as I know - is not as far down this road.

I'v copied 3 lists. It's not just science, but that's an important area and
has the features that none of the work is for profit - this may be
self-evident to us, but the point needs making. I've included discuss, to
pick up general views. It also overlaps with current thinking on access.
We'll need to identify a coordination mechanism soon.

Message-ID: <CACnMvBYxvNFGnpZNUqO0GhJEW4ZBEDMm_QWCMg8eEdj+=Xhx-A@mail.gmail.com>

Folks, I mentioned on the EtherPad the other day that I have been
working on a site to highlight the problem of what Peter Has called
"The Scholarly Poor".  I think we need something bold and clear that
doesn't go into too much technical detail, and that provides a lot of
personal stories that people can relate to.

I'm now ready to unveil PRIVATELY (i.e. only to this group) the
embryonic site, which is at
        http://youneedaccess.wordpress.com/

Please take a look around -- there is not much content yet, but I
think probably just enough to show how it will work.  Each new
interview/profile will be posted as part of the "Latest News" stream,
and also be linked from the category list on the right and on the home
page.  Aside from these main articles, I don't envisage much more on
the site: just the home page, the About page and probably a FAQ.  I
think we should probably avoid using it as a forum for writing about
related issues ourselves and keep it tightly focussed.

I am looking a few things:

1. Comments, criticism, suggestions.  You can leave these as comments
on the pages of the site, or email me (or this group) if you prefer.
2. A sense of whether this is more or less what we all intended, and
so whether the site can be part of @ccess.
3. Other people to join me in maintaining the site: we should really
have three or more editors to give the sense of a group.
4. Ideas of who to interview.  [At the moment, the two "interviews" on
the site are faked up from comments made in email and on blogs, and
found on websites.  They will need to be redone or replaced before we
go public.]

Enjoy!
        -- Mike.

problem but would you mind checking the settings?

Thanks very much!

Hi all,

For the website.
 What about the idea to coin the term @ccess principle(s)  for a webpage
describing our purposes and definition of @ccess. We would have to ask John
Willinsky evidently.

I think documented cases both of lack of access and ideally documented cases of what can happen when there is access. We need validated stories that we can tell about this as well as numbers and arguments. I think this is a great idea!

Excellent - even though I haven't managed to login yet (do I have to be a
wordpress user).

I am assuming we are intending to release this material as it becomes
appropriate - possibly in phases. There's nothing wrong with having small
groups of people working on projects off-air as long as it's clear that
it's temporary. If there is confidential material that's harder and will
require some careful thought.

I had a very good talk with the IPO (about Hargreaves) and they are
particularly looking for coherent, unemotional, evidence-based
presentations. It's difficult to devise an ethical double-blind trial about
the value of medical information, but that is not the only persuasive
material. Statements from authorities and peer-reviewed publications are
very valuable. Jenny made a great start on open-science.

Hi,

we have got fantastic news!  MalariaWorld has received funding from the
Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research to further develop an Open
Access 2.0 journal: the MalariaWorld Journal<http://www.malariaworld.org/mwj>.
This followed their call for proposals to develop new Open Access journals
and bring more scientific articles in the public domain. This journal is
already publishing at a slow rate, but with the help of this funding it can
develop into a full-fledged peer-reviewed scientific journal. The journal
is absolutely @ccess compliant and reading and publishing are zero-pay. We
can do this because MalariaWorld Journal is run under a new publication
model with minimal costs.
We think that this the first open access journals run by a @ccess community
for the community. All in line with the ideas of the @ccess initiative on
open access and open science. What do you think?

I worry that we will end up with too many not-quite-compatible sets of
principles.  (In fact, this has already happened, but I worry that we
will exacerbate it.)  I would prefer that we throw ourselves behind
the BOAI statements rather then re-re-reinvent the wheel.

Sorry, very stupid of me!  I have changed the settings now.  Of
course, this means the site is open to the world now, and at really
isn't ready for that -- so for now, DO NOT PASS ON THE URL.

That is an *excellent* point.  Sometimes I get so wrapped up in the
damage done by barrier-based publishing that I forget how much good is
done when research *is* open access!  So, yes, we want success stories
as well as frustrating ones.

Good to know.  If other agree, I will tweak the site to make it
obviously part of @access.

Thanks!  Please send me the email address by which you registered at
WordPress.com (register one first, if needs be!) and I will add you as
an administrator.  Please also send a photo and a brief biography like
the one of me at http://youneedaccess.wordpress.com/about/ -- I'll add
them.

Excellent.

Yes.  I see this as a functionally independent, though of course
organisationally very connected, effort.  A few of us should be able
to keep this site rolling along happily in our spare time once we have
it up and running.  I certainly don't imagine anything remotely
confidential on it.

I made that very point the other day on Twitter, in part of a thread
in which David Smith was rather implausibly claiming that lack of
access to research doesn't cost lives.

The first thing we should do on the website is to put a cc-by button on it.

What's with the picture on the top? Is it PD?

Good effort Mike! I'm quite happy with what you've done so far to
stand as it is. I don't think I should be the only translator quoted
though: there are much more eminent authorities than I that might be
interviewed. In translation theory jargon, the work we'd like to do
with open access articles is known the analysis of "parallel texts."
There is an extensive literature on this, and I think a review of the
subject, starting from the perspective of what open access might do
for translation quality, would be a good initiative.

There would also be mileage in pursuing the issue within the many
departments of translation studies and linguists' professional
associations, with the aim of encouraging reflection and debate on the
issue. Declarations of support for open access policies from such
organisations would be valuable.

I'll see what I can do ;-)

Regards to all,

D.

Thanks Alicia,
It's a valuable and useful development to have a formal contact in a
publisher that is able to speak authoritatively and responds. As you
yourself note Elsevier have not had a professionally organised procedure to
respond to reasonable constructive requests. (The only way I got any answer
was through a personal contact with an Elsevier).

I shan't tax the GOAL list with more mails but you may wish to note note
that many of the reader community finds it impossible to have any
meaningful formal contact with publishers. It would be a service if
publishers recognized the existence of readers as distinct from customers
(who are normally purchasing officers or librarians).

That's accurate. I offered a constructive opportunity two years ago which
could have significantly benefitted Elsevier as well as the Open world and
Elsevier has probably destroyed that opportunity.

and would be very happy to arrange a call for you and our relevant people.

I have no idea what the app marketplace team is but it sounds as if it
wasn't a good decision.

I am always prepared to talk with anyone, if there is seen to be the chance
of a productive outcome. At present my concerns are:
* I believe that I have certain fundamental rights to carry out text-,
data- and image-mining and that Elsevier contracts and practice deny me
them.
* I have been invited by the UK's Intellectual Property Office to submit a
response to the Hargreaves review as to why IP restrictions on textmining
shoul be removed and I shall be doing this in the context of the Open
Knowledge Foundation - through the newly formed open-access list (which is
copied in to this mail).

It is useful if all discussions take place Openly as then (a) a wide range
of people can take part and (b) there is a clear permanent record. Anyone
working for Elsevier or any other organization is welcome to join the list
and take part in our activities. We have no secret procedures and will be
working to create a response to Hargreaves.

Whatever the politics and legality of Open Access are, the actual practice
of it is very poorly labelled and supported by modern informatics. This
list is discussing the "Author Manuscript" but there is no standard
labelling, no licences, no statement of who is the copyright holder. Given
that the law allows copyright holders to pursue infringers the actual
practice of Open Access supported by publishers (Green and Hybrid) needs
serious improvement.

The rest of this may be of continuing interest to GOAL

So - for the record - the "unedited author manuscript" may contain material
inserted by Elsevier (presumably without the explicit involvement of the
author). It is a pity that possessive pronouns are used in an ambiguous or
misleading sense. As an author I would be upset if such a phrase was
inserted in a parer I had authored, but at present that is unlikely giving
that I am currently unlikely to contribute to Elsevier journals.

We will spell out on the OKFN open-access list the areas that would lead to
a potentially constructive discussion and possibly continue on it and on
skype.

Tom - I think you uploaded the picture?
I would encourage people to upload appropriate and relevant PD images to
the website Media Library once you have your login and we can have a
(slowly) rotating gallery on the launch page.

I can sort the CC-BY button

Thanks, that's great!

Feel free to send me more, though.  Oh, and if you have a better
photo, that would appreciated.  Or two or three, if you have them,
maybe one of them showing you at work?

That's great.  But I don't want to make big pages, I want to do many
short case-studies, each associated with an actual human being rather
than just an organisation.  So the one about you should stand, and
we'll add other pages about other translators as the opportunity
arises.  They will all be in the "translators" category, of course, so
you can click on that to see them all.

Yes; but not for this site.  I want to keep it simple and accessible
for any reasonably intelligent adult.  That doesn't mean we can't go
into any detail at all, of course, but we need to do it in an
accessible way such as you might find in, say, the Sunday Times colour
supplement.  Or maybe the Mail On Sunday.

This is very good news indeed.
I'm wondering if we can emphasize the support for *authors*.  I think one
of the biggest things we can do technically is to make it as attractive as
possible for authors to create their submissions. This includes:
* taking *their* view of a manuscript rather than the publishers. For
example if a group of people use dropbox and googledocs to create
manuscripts then formal submission should simply be a pointer to the
dropbox. Permissions are easy to manage. None of the awful forms we have to
go through which are different for every publisher.
* allowing and often insisting on submission on the web of supplemental
data.
* having a permanent record of versions of manuscripts, etc. A
Malaria-World repository.

Mark MacGillivray announced yesterday at JISC Dev-8D the outline of a
"continuous integration" approach to publishing. This is heavily used in
software and means that at any stage the software always works. You can
roll back and see what was in earlier versions, etc.

The main difficulty is that it is harder if authors have to submit to more
than one journal - going down the daisy-chain. If someone knows that they
are going to submit to MW  as their first choice then it may be possible to
make the authoring process more streamlined and beneficial.

I've been involved with a few papers with zillions of authors (see
http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n9/abs/nrd3503.html and
http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n9/pdf/nrd3503.pdf  ). I'm a  minor
author, but if someone wrote to me asking for a legal reprint (the
pre-submission version) I couldn't find it and I've probably never seen it
(I'll have made comments which went into the final version).

These versions are valuable becuse they may well have images, tables and
references that make it through unscathed to the end. Of course this
doesn't apply here, but it's a valuable thing to have. If I wanted to quote
from my own paper I'd probably find it useful to have a word or latex
document rather than a PDF

Also - do most people now use Googledocs for communal authoring?

The principle is good here, but I must warn against using DropBox in
particular for this.  It's not a means of ensuring everyone gets a
copy of the same stuff, it is literally a shared folder.  So what I've
seen happening when it's used as a distribution medium is that someone
looks at a document and then deletes it because he's seen all he needs
-- or maybe moves it into a project folder -- and then it's gone *for
everyone*.

So some other technology is more appropriate here.

> Also - do most people now use Googledocs for communal authoring?

I don't trust it.  I find it better to use OpenOffice, save in MS-Word
format (.doc) so that my less enlightened colleagues can also work on
the manuscript, and use the fantastically helpful Track Changes
facility so that as we pass it around, we can each see what the others
have done.

-- Mike.

agree :-)

I think it might also be a good idea to add a date on the site, e.g. in this line:

Authored on [date] by:

clearly nothing ended up going on the website :)

so let's see if anything happensthis time,

Hi Graham and Gilles

I'm not sure how closely you're following the new @ccess group but we're
trying to rapidly gather stories of where open access (or lack of) has
helped or hindered people.
Mike has created the following site http://youneedaccess.wordpress.com/ (NOT
YET PUBLIC - please keep the URL within this list for the time being)

Would you be able to put out a call to your patient networks? I've drafted
one below but feel free to shorten it and change any of the wording to
something you feel will encourage responses. We want people who are willing
to go on record publicly.

Let us know your thoughts!

Jenny

@ccess for all

We believe that the output of publicly funded research should be available
for everyone to read, from dentists to small businesses and students to
citizen scientists. Most importantly, it should be available to you. We
know how much patient groups value access to scientific knowledge and how
rapidly the latest findings turn over. Instant access is crucial, you want
rapid progress for yourselves, your relatives and friends.

We plan to develop tools to assist access to disease specific research and
enable communities and patient groups to interact wth the scientific
literature more easily. We also want to demonstrate to funding agencies,
policy makers, publishers and the general public just how important open
access to this kind of information is, to ensure that we take postitive
steps towards universal access to research.

However, we need your help. Tell us your story of how access to the
scientific literature helped you or someone you know - maybe even saved a
life. Do you have an example of where lack of access to research has been
detrimental to someone's treatment or wellbeing?

We want to provide a platform for these stories to raise awareness among
people who may only understand open access as an academic movement.

If you could contribute please contact jenny.molloy at okfn.org with your
story.

We are also interested to hear from people who would like to help guide the
development of tools for patient groups to discover, discuss and share
research, particularly by suggesting features you would find useful. You
can follow @ccess by joining our mailing list

I have already contacted other translators in my network with the aim

Quite so. I think your present format is excellent. Such an article
would be aimed at a translation journal, with polemical intent.

I have administrative access to the Panton Principles website. If you let
me know what you want and where, I can put it up :)

Definitely!

I included the line

or someone you know - maybe even saved a life.

but make this more prominent if you feel it gets lost.

Yeah,
I put this picture in with the idea that it represents a ' look through
open access ' in a picture of a fruit body.
The picture is PD since my wife made it this autumn.
I uploaded it just to have something "nice" on the first page for the
moment. Please change or delete when you think it inappropriate

Ah, thanks for this.  It was Scott Aaronson's review of this book at
        http://www.scottaaronson.com/writings/journal.html
that first kindled my fury at the status quo.  It will be interesting
to see that actual book.

re: example Scholarly Poor cases (non-academics with legitimate uses
for literature having trouble accessing it)

There's a good one in the comments section on a recent Mike Taylor post:
https://svpow.wordpress.com/2012/02/17/all-right-then-so-what-are-the-alternatives/#comment-14883

Traumador-the-Tyrannosaur writes:

"As a hobbist palaeo-artist one of the biggest restrictions and
challenges I have is doing proper research, so I don?t continue memes
or create a false reconstruction. During the day I?m an elementary
school teacher, so I have no access whats so ever to academic
literature (except all the cool new stuff coming out of PLoS and the
other new free access journals). Even just from my job?s point of
view, my task of science education would be made so much easier if I
had direct access to what scientists are saying rather than having to
rely on second or third hand rewrites of those same papers."

1.) Art - Can't create biologically-accurate artworks reconstructing
how fossil creatures looked (because most of the original descriptions
of them are behind paywalls)

2.) School teaching - this quotes speaks for itself - no paraphrasing needed!

"my task of science education would be made so much easier if I had
direct access to what scientists are saying rather than having to rely
on second or third hand rewrites of those same papers."


Two-cases in one!

Best,

Ross

PS please msg me if there's a wiki or website I'm meant to be adding
these to - I'm feeling a tad overwhelmed by the volume of emails on
these Open- mailing lists lately. Can be hard to keep track
sometimes...

Email is fine at this point.

Or you are welcome to become an editor of the new site and add your
own interviews!  Let me know off-list if you'd like to do that.

Definitely, I like the picture! We could intersperse it with others though,
it's maybe rather abstract to be the only one on the front page.

Message-ID: <CACnMvBaU3youAoAJ4PCbR-NYa_GXG285xTpp9UxoQ7eCdffMNg@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I went ahead and bought a custom domain for the Who Needs Access site
-- it can now be found on
        http://whoneedsaccess.org/

I deleted the THIS ISN'T READY warning on the front page, removed the
first post that just said hello, and have now added photos and brief
biographies of the three editors.  (Anyone else who would like to also
be an editor is welcome -- just let me know.)

I think the current quorum of a home page, an About page, three
articles and three editors is enough to launch with.  Agree?
Disagree?  If no-one objects, I will announce it on my own blog and on
Twitter, and turn on the "let search engines index this" option so
that it's no longer hidden.  I'll do this later tonight or tomorrow
morning.

Any last-minute comments before we launch, please shout now!

-- Mike.

Go for it!
Is there a clear explanation of how people can get in touch with their
stories?
In a bit of a rush or would double check this myself :)

Very excited about this.

Laura and I are talking about @ccess to the Cambridge geeks tomorrow night.
Can we show them snippets of the site? It's a lightning talk so probably
only 2-3 mins. We might well get some volunteers - who knows.

Laura - are you able to come here in the afternoon so we can prepare
something simple?

Looks good to go.

One category if people that I was missing is Wikimedians, bloggers and
other communicators.

Example: The German Wikipedia entry on Fabry disease (
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morbus_Fabry )
is one of the most detailed on the matter that can be found on the web
- certainly in German and possibly beyond. It
uses 26 figures from OA sources.

If you need images, what about featuring the Open Access File of the
Day from Wikimedia Commons?
It's available via
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Open_Access_File_of_the_Day
, and I am currently looking into ways of providing RSS feeds for it.

Until that happens,
https://toolserver.org/~magnus/catfood.php?language=commons&project=wikimedia&category=Open+access+%28publishing%29&depth=23&namespace=6&user=&size=300&last=100&doit=Do+it
provides a feed of files from OA sources that have recently been
uploaded to Wikimedia Commons.

Well, we have lift-off!  I have removed the Do Not Index instruction
from the site, tweeted it:
        https://twitter.com/#!/SauropodMike/status/171403113230647296
and briefly blogged it on Sauropod Vertebra Picture of the Week:
        http://svpow.wordpress.com/2012/02/20/a-new-site-who-needs-access-you-need-access/

I would appreciate it someone could add a link from the main @ccess
site.  Also if those of you who blog could blog about it, and those of
you who tweet could tweet about it.

Thanks,
        -- Mike.

Brilliant idea.
One of the great things that @ccess could do is to aggregate (directly or
through links) material that can be reused. Thus if I need a picture of a
mosquito biting something I can just go there and find it.

There is an obvious synergy with Wikimedia. One thing we can probably do is
extract images from feeds of Open scientific information (such as Open
access journals, government reports, etc.). We'll probably have to label
these manually (though I can see certain areas using image processing) and
then use faceted searching and browsing.

Until that happens,

Laura and I will announce it at CambGeeknight

I am SO delighted how well and quickly this has worked out. We originally
spent just over a week in offlist mails and then ideas started
crystallising, especially that we should DO something, that we would
address the positive rather than niggle at the negative.

@ccess scales. It's got an absolutely clear purpose - find (or liberate)
BOAI-compliant material, and show how it can be re-used. Sub-plot: build a
new generation of tools to maximise the value.

One of the exciting things is the network effect. Because we blog, tweet,
etc. we discover new people and new resources. When there is a bit more on
the site that could be time for another article or report in the Guardian.

Yes, I am really pleased to see things coming together so well and so
quickly.  Getting WNA up cost me a week of very late nights, but
hopefully it should run itself much more easily now that core is there
(especially as I have two co-editors now!)

That's good.  Maybe it (or a variant) should be a tagline at the top
of the main @ccess site.

That's good idea.  I've written a few things for non-technical outlets
recently, the my impression is definitely that the Guardian is the
best one to aim for: they move pretty quickly and tend to attract more
comments than other newspapers.  My sense is that they are taking Web
engagement more seriously than their rivals.

I like the idea. Or alternatively we could give it a prominent place on the
launch page and leave the now existing tag?. I think we should ad the
building of open science communities as one of our main purposes

The OKF has had a lot of engagement with the Guardian and I am sure we
could find a way to do a story in the near future. Laura, we could ask at
the next coord?

The uniqueness of @ccess is:

extracted (e.g. we understand licences, publishers, etc in a way that other
sites may not)
* the use and linking is created with special relevance to re-use of
scholarship. That will depend on the field - reusing a malaria photograph
needs different support from re-using an image of a papyrus
* we have a major emphasis on extracted data.
[and I am sure you can add more]

The images coming through on that File of the Day feed are very
beautiful, if a bit random. Perhaps it would also be useful to point
out that Google Advanced Image Search allows you to limit searches by
license?

http://www.google.com/advanced_image_search

This feature used to be presented in the results sidebar of any Google
Image search by default, but it seems to have been buried recently.
It's still there if you know to look for it.

Regards to all,

D.

Laura,(and others editing the @ccess site)

I am looking at the @ccess site just now, and I think it is too basic. I
don't want to rush things but since the site is up and running I think we
should style it as soon as possible. I don't like the idea of it staying
too long as a basic version, because it is how the world sees us. And the
first impression should be good.
I already proposed that we could use the same theme for this site as the
one that Mike used for whoneedsaccess.

*Points to address quickly:*
The landing page now is the about page, We should have it as the homepage I
think , and make a About page stating our purposes and history and
definition of Open Access ------> @ccess, don't you think? I have made a
Definition page private published that we might use.

Possibly we could also install a number of widgets like a twitter widget on
the site.e.g. Twitter Tracker, that one should then be updated to version
2,2
RSS could also be useful and than some.
*Could we dedicate another sprint to polish the site?*

Agreed.

Not agreed, here, though.  I think it's better that the sites be
immediately visually distinguishable, since they are aimed at very
different constituencies.

That said, we could give some *some* shared elements.  Am I right in
thinking that @ccess is hosted on OKFN's own WordPress installation?
If so, does that mean we can customise stylehseets?  If that's so, we
could start with the theme that Who Needs Access? uses
("Retro-fitted") and change the colour scheme.

Sounds reasonable.

Tracking what Twitter account?  I never heard back from whoever has @ccess.

I have contacts with the Dutch Lyme disease patient association. A friend
of mine is regional coordinator and I explained to him about @ccess and
showed him the WhoNeedsAccess site.He wiil get the information to the
Board. I think they will be interested to particicipate. I have done
research on Lyme disease myself and so I know how much confusion exists on
treatment possibilities, detection, symptoms etc. They (the patients) have
a hard time finding information

Excellent.  Now that I have done four interviews on the new site, I am
keen to see new content posted by the other editors!  It would be
great if you could post something every day for the first week.

Hi All

Stories are coming in thick and fast from Gilles and Graham's calls,
there's at least 6 so far so I'll follow up today and start posting
content. I've been without a computer at home for a couple of days so
haven't been able to do much but it should be back today!

Jenny

Excellent!

I think, then, that we should throttle the rate of new content -- aim
for one per day?

Don't forget to get photos of the people we profile: we have to keep a
human face on everything.

Definitely, that sounds about right, I'll store everything as drafts in the
meantime.

Thanks Laura!

So something like:

The Panton Principles may be cited using the following details in the
relevant citation style for your publication:
Murray-Rust P, Neylon C, Pollock R, Wilbanks J (19 Feb 2010). Panton
Principles, Principles for open data in science. Retrieved [insert date]
from http://pantonprinciples.org/

or the title could come first as Cameron suggested, does anyone have a
specific preference? 19 Feb 2010 is the date PP were announced on the OKF
blog.

This should be made into an FAQ I think, it's probably unnecessary to have
it on the main page...

Jenny

Many thanks - will be interesting to track the citation rate through

No harm in having it in both places if Claudia thinks it would be easier to
track, we can always put it in smaller text somewhere at the bottom.
Laura can see how it looks.

I have added the citation format to the bottom of the main page
http://pantonprinciples.org/, and as Question 7 in the FAQ :)

Let me be absolutely clear:

(i) The Panton principles have exactly the same value for scholarship
which isn't Science = STM.

As humanities scholar I cannot accept the idea that research and
science are the same thing. Fortunately German Wissenschaft means
both: arts/humanities and science.

(ii) Citations guidelines valid only for Science are not acceptable.

There are enough disciplines with full first name standard. You cannot
identfiy something with personal IDs like PND etc. with first name
initals. I think it is bibliographically - open bibliography! -
important enough to know WHO wrote an article. "Pollock R" is saying
absolutely nothing - one has to do additional research to find out who
is R[ ] Pollock.

(iii) As is there is anglo-centric thinking that only contributions in
the English language have ontological value there is also STM-centric
thinking.

Sorry for repeating this.

Klaus

Citation style is a matter for whoever is writing the citation, and
what sort of justification they are seeking when doing so.

I agree with Klaus, but also do not think we can cover every citation
eventuality. I have no solution for this, beyond writing documents
online and using href links.

At least part of what Klaus is saying seems to be an easy fix.

How about:
Panton Principles, Principles for open data in science. Murray-Rust, Peter;
Neylon, Cameron; Pollock, Rufus; Wilbanks, John. (19 Feb 2010). Retrieved
[insert date] from http://pantonprinciples.org/

Would everyone be happy with that?

This is fine.

Please note: You can easyly truncate a full first name to get a
science-conform citation but you cannot enrich an initial without
knowing the person. I wonder whether the problem of author ids and
science-"initialism" (have I invented that word?) has played any role
in the discussion on open bibliography until now. On social networks
like Mendeley persons are not known in the "C Neylon" style.

I admit that I am an STM-centric thinker. I try to avoid it but often fail.

However, rightly or wrongly, the PP are now a historical document. We
deliberately limited ourselves to science because:
* there was a pressing problem. (There still is but the problem is better
defined now)
* factual data are critical to many sciences. That's not to say that other
disciplines don't also have facts but the sciences tend to have larger
amounts
* we were able to make a useful distinction between text, data and
metadata. Later Adrian Pohl reused the PP to develop the Principles for
Open Bibliography. In that we had to work harder to define what the "data"
were

I'm sympathetic to this. An electronic article has a fairly definitive
canonicalisation (though not defined) and is intended to be locatable. It
is possible to reconstruct most (but not all) authors. But the PP do not
have a definitive location and are also LIBRE so they can be copied.

If you think there are disciplines beyond STM to which the principles could
apply and be operated then it sounds an excellent idea. But you will
probably have to work hard to define what is data and what is open.

I have updated with first names in full. I am happy to follow the
consensus, but I take Klaus' point that it is relatively easy to remove
info to conform to science standards, whereas adding information that isn't
given is much harder.

Open Access refers according the Berlin definition also to heritage
items whic is a central point for me.

"Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities"

I cannot understand the enthusiasm for BOAI if that means that the
Berlin progress is ignored.

"Open access contributions include original scientific research
results, raw data and metadata, source
materials, digital representations of pictorial and graphical
materials and scholarly multimedia
material."

Data isn't defined there and I cannot see any valid reason not to
transfer the Panton Principles 1:1 to scholarship outside science. I
do not have to work hard to define what is data and what is open. Data
is all the researchers need for his research, and open is open
according the OKF-definition.

Hi,

I have done a major update on the @ccess site for more content and a better
look, and also put in the CC-BY licence. I will try to improve on it in the
next few days.
Have a look and change / edit when and wherever you feel the need......

I agree that more information is helpful, the whole point of the example
citation was to contain the information necessary to change to any other
citation style, I wasn't aware that full names were the standard in
humanities. In this case, the full names do appear on the same page it
would just take a little more effort on the part of the person writing the
citation but we may as well save them a couple of minutes.

While the Panton Principles could be adopted by other scholarship, the
intention was to create guidelines for scientists for the reasons Peter
mentioned. Subsequent efforts based on the Principles (the FAQ section of
the website, Panton Discussions, Panton Papers) have followed this trend so
it would be difficult to change the wording to incorporate humanities, it
is now historical. Adoption and modification is encouraged though and a 1:1
transfer with some rewording could be possible. The document is STM-centric
by design (that was the target community) but as you say the values are
much broader.

massive shift in scholarly opinion. The key point for me is that factual
data cannot be copyrighted and are effectively PD. in PP-1.0 we were
addressing scientific data as already in the public domain but not widely
represented as such. Metadata, pictorial and graphical materials are
copyrightable. So there is a fundamental difference - we would be asking
for people to change the copyright on copyrighted material. The PP and the
Principles of Open Bibliography required people simply to assert what they
believe to the the rights to data ad=nd bibliographic metadata - that they
are inherently PD.

Looks great Tom!
I've added some OKFN Open Content buttons to the license box and made the
101 reasons into a numbered list so we can keep track :)
Will try and do more later in the week.

Subject: [Open-access] One small record box for RWTH Aachen University
 Archive, one giant leap for mankind
Message-ID: <CADB6pjPMN1u+s8exNn9-JPPdGvhpNV00M6gDvYARXdr+ZuS1=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday, 21th February 2012, on my 54. birthday, I got as RWTH
Aachen university archivist a small record box from a professor's
widow, a very special donation. The professor, a physicist, has been
warning against the climate change already in the 1980's. But the
content of his papers isn't the reason I am so excited. The heirs have
given our archive not only exclusive copyrights for the whole work of
the researcher, they have also conceded to the public that the whole
work is available under CC-BY! This is the first time as far as I know
that all of the intellectual production of a scientist is really open
for re-use under CC-BY (except the cases he might have explicitely
transferred the copyright to publishers or learned societies).

Hi,

 

I've been following this discussion with great interest.  Looking at the
website, I'm surprised that it has no obvious @ccess branding on the
home page, or indeed on other pages.  Isn't this an opportunity missed?

 

One other point.  I know @ccess is a very forward-looking organisation,
but on the "About" page the copyright statement "the interviews on this
site and all other text is copyright (c) 2122" strikes me as a bit
ambitious!  ;-)

Hi,

 

I have done a major update on the @ccess site for more content and a
better look, and also put in the CC-BY licence. I will try to improve on
it in the next few days. 

Have a look and change / edit when and wherever you feel the need......

Agreed.

Not agreed, here, though.  I think it's better that the sites be
immediately visually distinguishable, since they are aimed at very
different constituencies.

That said, we could give some *some* shared elements.  Am I right in
thinking that @ccess is hosted on OKFN's own WordPress installation?
If so, does that mean we can customise stylehseets?  If that's so, we
could start with the theme that Who Needs Access? uses
("Retro-fitted") and change the colour scheme.

Sounds reasonable.

Tracking what Twitter account?  I never heard back from whoever has
@ccess.

Thanks for pointing that out Peter!

Mike - should we simplify the licensing text on the
whoneedsaccess.orgAbout page? I think we can just say that all content
is licensed under
CC-BY unless otherwise noted and keep the sentence about what that means
you can do with it. Mentioning copyright and CC-BY in the same sentence may
confuse some people, especially those who aren't familiar with the nature
of CC licensing. Most sites just point out the license e.g. on OKFN.org: The
content of this site is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
License <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/> (all jurisdictions)
and then anything that we can't put out as CC-BY we just have to make
crystal clear that is the case.

We should probably make some more obvious links between the two but it's a
work in progress :)

I guess you're right about the potential confusion (even though in
fact the two statements are wholly compatible).  I have amended the
page along the lines you suggest.

Jenny, Laura

I found another Q&A plugin for wordpress which is free and very complete.
The previous one is lite or pro and the pro cost some.  S oI think we could
go for the Question2answer plugin

That requires more admin privileges than I have I'm afraid!
One for Laura! Could you also allow all the access blog authors to create
etherpads under http://open-access.okfnpad.org/?

Thanks very much!

Hi,

I have made Jenny, Peter M-R, Tom O and Mike T all admins on the etherpad.
You should have received an email with a confirmation link - once you've
activated that, you will have administrative access to create etherpads and
add other users as necessary.

I might be able to drop by at 11am tomorrow to give you all a hand. I'm not
sure how to add a new plug-in either, but I'll ask around today and do my
best.

Speak soon!
Laura

Message-ID: <CAN6n2b2e5VReuXAmPELVwRyCav7NnQz4i5vcWdUn5UXhdi8r7A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I recently started
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_transfer_agreement
and am looking for improvements, especially illustrations.

Do any of you know of a journal that recently switched from
toll-access to open access and may be in a position to provide a
suitably licensed copy of their former Copyright transfer agreement?

Thanks,

Daniel

Does  it have to be a journal that switched? Or do you just want CTAs under
Open licences (for the CTAs)? I wouldn't have thought that was too difficult

Hi Laura,
the link in my mail points to the instructions for downloading Q2A. It has
to be done at OKFN because it has to be in the right directory on the
server.
We can talk about this tomorrow on the Skype call

Subject: [Open-access] Green Gold Gratis Libre
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Pumu8W3CfdmrKjwyW4TztcxRCCMHgOxzUSYf2Njbo-iA@mail.gmail.com>

We had a brief discussion at the end of today's skype on Green/Gold and
Open Access. We agree that Green and Gold do not define whether something
is/isNot BOAI-OK. It may be useful to define what some of these are:

LIBRE: This is effectively synonymous with BOAI.

GRATIS: This is free of financial charge. That is all. It does not
guarantee:
  * re-use rights
  * permanency (free beer is usually constrained in time)
  * lack of technical constraints. (Users may be required to register,
receive adverts, etc.)
  * considerations of access (for humans, machines, etc.)

GREEN: The means that one of the following has put "a scholarly
publication" on the web:
  * a human author or their representative
  * the human's employer/institution/department
  * a publisher acting on the behalf of the author. An example is that a
publisher may deposit the manuscript in an institutional repo
  Undefined aspects are:
    - length of greenness. An author may not guarantee infinite visibility
    - rights. These are usually poorly defined
    - time of deposit (i.e. is there a delay after publication)
  It is unclear whether a publisher who makes material GRATIS after a
period makes that material "Green". Some Green publishing requires that
publications are only available on certain sites and not on others

GOLD: This means that a publisher has put the material on the web as part
of the publication process. Undefined aspects:
    - length of goldness. this is normally infinite
    - rights. These are sometimes CC-BY but often NC or poorly defined
    - time of deposit (i.e. is there a window after publication)

We agree that Green-CC-BY is possible (e.g. nature Precedings). Green does
not imply any requirement to announce or register the site(s)..

Please hack any of this. We can then start to put it on the wiki

This almost all looks right to me.

Yes.  It might be worth making the point that CC-BY is a libre licence
(the canonical one, really) whereas CC-BY-NC is merely a gratis
licence.

(We probably don't want to get into discussing CC-BY-SA, since there
are validly differing opinions on where that is more or less free than
CC-BY, just as people disagree over whether the GNU GPL or Modified
BSD licence is more free for software.)

Yes.  This doesn't exhaust the possibilities, either.  For example,
the maintainer of a green subject-specific repositiory might reposit.
Basically, I think it's anyone but the publisher.

Since these aspects are the same for Green and Gold, it's better not
to list them twice, but just to have a separate section at the end on
what neither Green nor Gold guarantees.

In the end, the ONLY difference between green and gold is who makes
the article physically available.  In gold, it's the publisher, in
green it's someone else.  You could characterise the difference as:
does the publisher actually HELP, or merely not hinder?

On permanence: there is a difference between how permanently something
has access rights (e.g. releasing under any CC licence is irrevocable)
and how permanently something is hosted.  In practice, anything CC'd
is free forever because it gets mirrored across the world.

> It is unclear whether a publisher who makes material GRATIS after a period

Again this is nothing to do with green vs. gold.  It's about the licence.

Yes.  Gold-CC-BY-SA is also possible, e.g. Elsevier sponsored
articles.  (BTW., I have a blog post about there coming out this
evening.  Anyone who doesn't follow my blog
http://svpow.wordpress.com/ probably should at the moment -- it's
almost entirely about open issues.)

That will be helpful.

Dear all,

with the subject line, I mean that Alex Holcombe's video of a dialogue

( http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scientist-meets-publisher-English.ogv )
is going to be featured on the main page of Wikimedia Commons

If you were thinking about blogging on such agreements or related

Cheers,

Strictly speaking if we're focussed on BOAI this point is moot as the BOAI specifies CC-BY (as does the Open Source Definition). One of the things that's worrying me is the conflation of BOAI and OKD which are actually different on this point. As Mike says, we probably don't want to start that argument up again (I'm right, you're all wrong, clearly) but we should probably be clear about this. For me BOAI-compliant is pretty clear.

Cheers

Cameron

Wait -- do you mean that literally?  I have been using
        http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/boaifaq.htm#openaccess
as the BOAI definition -- it describes something very like CC-BY, but
doesn't name (which is unsurprising as IIRC it predates CC).  Is there
a newer BOAI definition that actually SAYS CC-BY?

> (as does the Open Source Definition).

No.  The OSD
        http://opensource.org/docs/osd
definitely does not mention CC, and does includes the GNU GPL, which
has an SA condition.
        http://opensource.org/licenses/category

> One of the things that's worrying me is the conflation of BOAI and OKD which are actually different on this point.

Absolutely:
        http://opendefinition.org/
is explicitly SA-friendly.

> As Mike says, we probably don't want to start that argument up again (I'm right, you're all wrong, clearly) but we should probably be clear about this. For me BOAI-compliant is pretty clear.

Agreed.  It says what we want it to say, AND it's the oldest
definition (at least among those in common knowledge -- right?) of the
term "open access".  That it the one we want to be using.

Sorry, been a long day/week/month whatever.

My reading of the BOAI, which as you say predates CC is that it is clear that "the only use of copyright is to assure attribution and to ensure the integrity of their work" which to me makes it clear that it should be CC-BY (you could make an argument that it allows ND but I'm pretty sure we don't want to go down that road!)

Yeh, sorry, you are absolutely right. Getting my NC and SA mixed up while I'm typing, which just shows that I very badly need a holiday?.

And there are historical and philosophical reasons for that that I recommend people get their heads around. It's a quite subtle but important differing of views.

It's the original and best in my view - but then I'm biased :-)

Isn't the Definition of the Berlin conference compliant with BOAI but
covering more types of media? I remember I think Klaus Graf commenting on

For me this discussion is a little bit strange.

I am an advocate of the BBB definition of OA and do not appreciate any
try to ignore the progess between BOAI and Berlin. Berlin is the most
accepted OA declaration.

Suber has shown several times that the BBB definitions have a core
meaning. Therefore it is allowed to speak of "the" BBB definition.

CC-BY is the CC license which fits best the BBB definition but at the
time of the BOAI CC (which was foundet also in 2001) was only in statu
nascendi.

The Berlin definition has towo points which are not up to date:

(1) "as well as the right to make small numbers of printed copies for
their personal use." This is overruled by all CC licenses.

(2) "A complete version of the work and all supplemental materials,
including a copy of the permission as stated above". This is overruled
by tagging with CC-licenses.

What gratis and libre means has been fixed in a Suber/Harnad agreement:

http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/08-02-08.htm#gratis-libre

We should not confuse the things by claiming that CC-NC or ND isn't
libre ("removal of price and at least some permission barriers").

Perhaps! The problem with Green is that there is no legal provision and

This is the sort of confusion which makes us to an OA sect.

I agree. BOAI is OKD-compliant so it's quite acceptable to use the OKF
facilities for the discussion, pages etc (and thanks).

I get tired of writing BOAI-compliant - is there a shorter form like
BOAI-OK?

I had not seen Peter Suber's gratis/libre post before.  It is very
good, and I highly recommend it to everyone.  It makes much of what
we've discussed here unnecessary:
        http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/08-02-08.htm#gratis-libre

But I wish he'd have the basic common sense to put each of his posts
on a separate page!  There is a better page to cite (with the same
content) at:
        http://www.arl.org/sparc/publications/articles/gratisandlibre.shtml

Having seen this, I think we should not attempt our own definitions.
They would be superfluous and would only create more confusion.

-- Mike.

P.S. Can anyone briefly bring me up to speed on the history?  Why do
we even HAVE a Berlin definition when we already had the Budapest
definition?  What was that not sufficient?

While I am not sure exactly what Klaus means by that last statement, I
do have to say that I agree that I mistaken in equating CC-BY with
libre and CC-BY-NC with gratis.  Suber's post explicitly says that he
considers CC-BY-NC to be a libre licence -- merely not the most
liberal.  It's unfortunate, but there it is.

To summarise:
        CC => libre (to some degree)
        CC-BY => BBB

I think that is all we can confidently say.

No.  Because there is more than one kind of permission barrier to remove,
there is more than one kind or degree of libre OA.  BBB OA is one kind or
subset of libre OA.  But there are others, and not all libre OA is BBB OA.

For example, permitting all uses except commercial use (the CC-NC license)
and permitting all uses except derivative works (the CC-ND license) are not
equivalent to one another and --ignoring certain subtleties-- not
compatible with the BBB definition.  But they all remove price barriers,
they all remove at least some permission barriers, and therefore they are
all libre OA.

We shouldn't speak as if there were just one kind of libre OA.  Gratis OA
may be just one thing (freedom from price barriers), but libre OA is a
*range* of things (freedom from price barriers and one or more permission
barriers).

 I had forgotten this. I have argued it with PeterS and I think it's the
root of many of our problems. You can remove one small permission barrier
and therefore call it LIBRE. Libre can be crafted so that the recipient has
almost no rights. LIBRE-OA is NOT the same as LIBRE-software

So we should stick with BOAI or BBB - and work out which. We are all agreed
that NC and ND are detrimental to what we want to see.

It is a very confusing area and one of the most valuable things we can do
is to make everything rock-solidly clear and make our arguments on top of
that.

We could avoid some trouble with OA and libre definitions if we accept
the simple slogan "Make all research results CC-BY (and the data
CC0)!"

"We need TRUE libre OA and this means CC-BY"

"BBB-compliant is only CC-BY"

I think we should underline that Suber explicitely says that CC-NC nor
CC-ND isn't BBB-compliant. WE are on the ground of the BBB-definition
and the intentions of the people who have written and initially
accepted these definitions. We can find some statements on this topic
in Suber's writings.

Harnad has accepted this in 2008:

"The BBB definition describes one kind or subset of libre OA.  But not
all libre OA is BBB OA."

 http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/442-guid.html

Libre OA is a necessary but no sufficient condition for the really
"open" (open = OKF) OA we whish.

Thanks, Peter - this list is instructive, especially in the cases
where some explanation is provided for the conversion. Nothing sprang
to mind in terms of illustration, though.

Yes.

So our goal is not merely OA; nor even merely Libre OA; but specifically BBB OA.

Sorry, I really shouldn't talk licences when I'm as exhausted as I currently am. Agree we should focus on BBB..

And with that I'm signing off for the weekend before I make more of a fool of myself :-)

It is in the link list of the @ccess website from the beginning and also in
the definition page2
I also think it is very clear on green ,gratis, libre and free

I think the Budapest Definition is still very valid and the most libre kind
of open access (see peter's mail). The list can still be signed!!!  fgs
 The other conferences are more detailed descriptions for other kinds of
media as far as I can tell.
I think that we can safely stick with BOAI Open Access defined by us as
@ccess  and only refer to the other detailed descriptions like Berlin for
those cases where this is necessary.because of inclusion of other media.
If we don't stick with it we only create confusion IMO.

Just like Cameron I am likely to get things wrong. So we should construct a
simple phrase that we all agree on. We decide things like:
* it must contain "BOAI"
* it should not contain the words "open" "access" "libre"

so "BOAI-compliant" is one possibility.

We avoid trying to be too clever and add other words of explanation.

The movie itself has no declaration of rights (unless I have missed it).
Embedding the movie in Wikimedia pages is fragile declaration of rights. A
simple CC-BY or CC0 on the credits is needed.

We discussed this on open-access meetup yesterday. Can we come up with a
simple digital means for stamping images and movies as CC-BY/0/PDDL? It's
not difficult to see how it could be done for images (create a bitmap,
replace the pixels with "@access CC0" or whatever. I'm sure I'm not the
first to think of it.

Not sure whether I follow you, Peter - surely, embedding on a
Wikimedia page doesn't say much about copyright and licensing terms,
but if you click on the video's preview image (rather than the play
button), you are brought to the page with the metadata. That is
standard on MediaWiki, and I thought you were aware of that.
Or what am I missing?

The video has been taken down as a supposed copyright violation,
primarily because of unclear provenance.

Hi all,

In one of our national newspapers Volkskrant of today I read an article on
the new company United Academics, who want to build communities of
scientists with their own lit databases and new models of publication. It
has to grow into a facebook for scientists.
There is at least one comparable company ReserchGate, as far as I know
Our ideas (@ccess) of building communities are different as we don't focus
on scientists only. But we do want to build communities, implement new
publishing systems, provide platforms for interaction. provide access to as
much information as possible. For all this we have the poassible
collaboration in the Github Science projectand the new Bibsoup system,  big
advantages.
When entrepreneurs are seeing possibilities, I am the more convinced that
we have something going that can become very successful indeed

Hi Bjoern,

more or less, yes. They () have clearly as a main objective to do
business.and see opportunities.
As long as we have the better cards, as I think we have, it's OK. We should
be careful however to guard some of the less developed ideas that we just
started working on.

Indeed,
I imagine the rights are unclear. They are technically the copyright of the
authors but it would have to be individuals who complained.

I thought about it, but there isn't any chemistry. However we could extract
the bibliography/citations

Could it be that Alex didn't have the right to release the video under
CC0 if it was produced using the Xtranormal software, even though he
paid for using it?

Xtranormal's terms of service are at http://www.xtranormal.com/tos/ .

Hi Laura,
I really want to have the Q2A or Q&A software to work with on the @ccess
site.
There is also a program called communities from the same people as Q2A.
Both these programs cost one-time $17   Would that be a problem?
Q&A is open source and free. We could also start with this.
Can you hunt this?
Alternatively I could install things on the Wordpress directory of the OKFN
server myself, but then I would need to be granted sufficient admin rights

Hi Laura, everyone

I can install plugins if you are needing some done. Just let me know
which ones you want, if you decide to buy non-free ones or not (I
don't have control over buying them, but do have admin control for
installing).

Elsevier has withdrawn its support for the RWA!

Who saw that coming?

Fantastic. Plainly the result of the grassroots revolt, led by those
such as yourself and Timothy Gowers.

Let's not rest on our laurels.  FRPAA, here we come!

Yes, Elsevier has acceded to one small gesture.

but RWA is arguably dead anyway, thus it's a welcome but token move in
my opinion.
It still does nothing to change my (and others) valid opposition to
all the other bad things that Elsevier have done and *are still doing*

thus the boycott is still on. We still have many valid demands yet to be met.

Roll on FRPAA!

To be honest RWA was dead in the water from day one. The challenge now is to get a positive momentum behind real change and to get more of the people who have become aware of the issues to become more active. FRPAA is phase one. Finch report in the UK and then the EU are next key steps.

Hi Mark,

I would like to have the Q2A installed http://
www.question2answer.org/wordpress.php
I am also interested in the Q&A of WPMuDev
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qa/
this latter is the lite version which is free and we can use it to compare
the 2 programs.and choose the best one
I would be very happy if you could install these 2  in the plugin directory
so that I can put them to use on the @ccess site

Who Needs Access? Academics Need Access!  See this paragraph from Tim
Gowers' latest blog post:
http://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/elseviers-open-letter-point-by-point-and-some-further-arguments

As for the report they refer to, it again is very hard to interpret
without a lot more information. My experience with Elsevier papers is
this. If an author has taken the trouble to put a paper on the arXiv
or on his or her homepage, then access to that article is easy (no
thanks to Elsevier); otherwise, it is virtually impossible. Probably
if I made more effort, I would be able to work out how to get access
to Elsevier articles via Cambridge University?s subscriptions to their
journals. But if I?m working from home, then I know that that is a
complicated process that involves setting up some kind of account with
our computer services ? I tried it once but didn?t follow through to
the end. In practice, if an article is behind the Elsevier paywall, I
don?t read that article. Does that make me an outlier? Am I one of the
7%? Is my situation even part of what the question covers? I haven?t
tried recently, but maybe if I tried to open an Elsevier article from
the computer in my departmental office I would have no trouble. But
all that would say is that Elsevier didn?t have a completely stupid
system for opening articles.

How so?  It certainly didn't look that way from my relatively
uninformed position.

Yes.

> Finch report in the UK and then the EU are next key steps.

What is this Finch report?  You've mentioned it a couple of times, but
the only one I've been able to find is something to do with nursing,
and I don't think can be related.  Is it the in-progress report that's
wandering off target?  Are there any web sites about it?  What
can/should be done?

Hi guys,

If you could just run all this past Nils, our Sysadmin guy (in cc) that
would be great. I'm not sure of the implications of installing plug-ins
into our word press sites, but I think it would be worth making sure Nils
knows what you're planning and approves from a technical point of view :)

@Nils, I created a trac ticket for this last week:
http://trac.okfn.org/ticket/1194

Thanks,
Laura

It was a pre-emptive strike to create a negotiation from a position of strength. They never really expected to get it through as far as I can tell. I don't get this DC politics stuff but its all shadow boxing as far as I can work out. Just that real people get hurt in the process.

Not sure what should be done yet. We need to be well positioned to either affect the outcome or produce a compelling alternative document. But I'm not sure of strategy on this at the moment and haven't had head space to think about it to be honest.

Has anyone asked Xtranormal?

Their TOS isn't the clearest (very few are!) but further down that page 
it says:

'Please note that if you want to create a video, post it on YouTube to 
benefit from their advertising revenue sharing program you do not need a 
?Business? or ?Reselling? account.'

This suggests that they might regard 'personal use' as including posting 
online for free, *without* benefit of ad revenue. Or even if they don't, 
maybe they'll consent to the Wikimedia posting anyway - great free 
publicity for them?

I agree that we need to force the positive. Some months ago I proposed that
access to the scientific literature should be a fundamental human right:
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/09/30/access-to-scientific-publications-should-be-a-fundamental-right/
It's simple to understand, compelling and politically tractable.
Is there a chance that this would fly in Europe? I have been invited to a
meeting where Neelie Kroos will be present - we need a simple concept that
we should hammer.

I think its particularly important to accentuate positive routes for action and practical ways forward. My suspicion is that following the positive message of yesterday we should brace ourselves for a series of negative attacks. Points of details, attempts to create wedge issues, and certainly to distract. If I were running tactics for Elsevier that would be my game plan. My guess is that the current strategy is to try and capture the OA publishing movement and drive a wedge between us and the repository folks. In the longer term we need a much more sophisticated message for that - I think IRs and DRs are just publishers, simply different types of publishers for instance - but in the short term keep your ear to the ground for whispers.

I hesitate to push the human rights angle in the UK at the moment, but in Europe it might. Or at least as part of the puzzle. But it does somehow need to be balanced against the national security and IP concerns that will ranged against it. I don't mean that it needs to be a balanced argument but it needs to be clear why the right of access to information from research is different in some sense - because otherwise that will be seen as an easy take down approach.

Hi All

I am going to the SAGE Biocongress in SF in April and am thinking that I might present whoneedsaccess to that audience and do some video interviews with folks about their needs. I'll also be talking to the International Cancer Research Portfolio and may have a chance to do some more interviews there. Does this seem like a good idea to folks. There's an opportunity for lightning presentations at SAGE and if people are happy then I'll present the website - I appreciate I've done none of the work but it seems like a good publicity opportunity.

Cheers

Cameron

Hi Cameron

I think it's a great idea! Video content would also be fantastic, I'm happy
to do some video editing, I've signed up for a course in it so I'll need
some practise material :)
We should at some point get members of @ccess and a video camera in the
same place and do a promo video with snippets from us and some scholarly
poor interviews.

I like the idea of describing IRs as publishers.  That isn't
necessarily a point we need to make -- we can just start talking that
way as though it's always been assumed.  "Like other publishers, IRs
make works available under some specific licence; unlike many other
publishers, that licence is often permissive."  That kind of thing.

National security?!

Is anyone seriously going to propose that OA poses a threat to
national security because when we publish How To Build Atom Bombs with
Elsevier, the terrorists won't pay the $35?

Good point.

No, but if we say "Access to research information is a human right" then there will be those who will line up to see that we are clearly a bunch of loons because "obviously security information isn't a human right" and "obviously they don't understand IP" so my point is that there needs to be a very strong and clear case as to why research information is different - because we can't win those other arguments in the near term (at least not on our own)

I'll also be talking to the International Cancer Research Portfolio and may have a chance to do some more interviews there. Does this seem like a good idea to folks. There's an opportunity for lightning presentations at SAGE and if people are happy then I'll present the website - I appreciate I've done none of the work but it seems like a good publicity opportunity.

AbsoLUTEly yes!  That would be outstanding.  You certainly shouldn't
worry about not having done the work on that particular web-site: this
is a group effort and no-one is going to claim that you're not doing
your share!   Please proceed!

More generally, I am keen to get a few more posts up on WNA as soon as
we can (great job on Wayne Wells, Jenny!) so that the site feels
substantial enough to start shopping around newspapers.  I'm hopeful
that I can get the Guardian to do a piece on it, for example.  But
while we still have only six interviews in total, I'm not sure that
we're ready to go.

I've just spoken to Rufus about this.

@Tom O., Rufus has suggested you create an account on trac and comment
directly on the ticket (http://trac.okfn.org/ticket/1194). He would like to
know whether you have experience of the plug-in, and whether it will work
on our multi-site?

Thanks,
Laura

In my opinion it would be very good to use this approach with Neelie Kroes.
I think she will be sensitive to these (political) arguments. At the same
time I hope that we will have index data and tables with journal
restriction policies, that might convince her to support us.  When and
where will this meeting take place??

Hi,
I can't seem to be able to create an account for trac without invitation.
The Q2A open source plugin will have to be configured with individual WP
site directories as I see it. I will check on that.
The Q&A lite is a pre-configured plugin which should work :
http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/qa/
I will try to find out more about the other, in the meantime I think the
Q&A is safe to install. I have no personal experiences with it though.

I think I don't need to emphasize that pushing the notion
that libraries which host IRs are publishers.

In fact, that's one of the things which beg the question:
what do we need 'real' publishers for?

Shouldn't this question be solved first? I still have never
gotten a satisfying answer.

Again, this is a matter of strategy.  I am open to a world where there
is nothing that resembles what we currently think of as a "publisher".
 But if we push that notion from the start, rather than going for
incremental but important change of publishers that seem to publish
rather than hide content, we simply will not be able to take a
critical mass of academics with us.  Even now I know a lot of
colleagues who, while sharing our distaste of the status quo, fear
something as exotic as an open-access publisher like PLoS.  It's just
not realistic to expect those people to swing behind an initiative
that will throw EVERYTHING up in the air at once.

Incremental changes are the only way to go.  (And even then it isn't
really incremental: cancelling Elsevier subscriptions will be a
catastrophic event for most libraries.)

But it's much harder to produce professional-looking/sounding video
than professional-looking text.  So we need to be careful to keep
standards up.

Dear Peter and all,

Last year the Civil Society Section, Office of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Human Rights, UN expert on cultural rights, organized
public consultation on the right to enjoy benefits of scientific progress
and its applications:
http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/CulturalRights/Pages/Consultation7December2011.aspx.
Question 5 was OA related: *What legal, administrative, policy or other
measures have been adopted/are under consideration to eliminate barriers to
scientific communication and collaboration, such as censorship,
restrictions on access to the Internet or on free availability of
scientific literature and journals*? And now the Independent Expert in the
field of cultural rights, Ms. Farida Shaheed, prepares annual report ?The
right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications? to
the Human Rights Council, to be presented in June 2012.
ieculturalrights at ohchr.org was a contact email to participate in the public
consultation.

Best wishes,
Iryna

'real' publishers, Bjoern?

well, I guess, in the age of the web real publishers might be the authors themselves who organize traditonal peer review for their contributions openly on the web

any other suggestions?

Indeed, my whole point was that there's no distinction
between what we see as 'publishers' and libraries in terms
of functionality. Thus, we can cut out the commercial ones,
as they add nothing but cost a lot. Libraries provide the
infrastructure, support and know-how to help researchers do
what you imply.

I don't really know Peter, perhaps write to them, suggest the assistance
with this report and ask how we can contribute (what and by when)? We at
EIFL sent our submission during public consultations (in November), they
thanked us but didn't provide any further information.

Laura, Nils,

Could you tell me if it is possible to have the Q&A lite plugin installed
so that I will be able to test it for the @ccess site.
In my optimism I had planned to do this tonight because my son who holds a
doctorate in computer sciences is there to help me

Hi Tom,

I've just spoken to Nils - he will look at this in an hour's time. Hope
that's OK for you!

Thanks,

I've just found a rich seam of potential interviewees for Who Needs
Access? if we still need more...?

I've added them as a comment to the Contribute page:
http://whoneedsaccess.org/contribute

I'll, work on finding more. Here are some of them, and relevant direct
quotes - if we can't contact these people, perhaps we can still lift
their quotes (with proper attribution & permalinks) for our website?

1.) Ally Fogg - Journalist
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12192218
contact: ally at allyfogg.co.uk

"...In my occasional forays into writing for CiF and elsewhere, I've
often wanted to refer to academic articles. If I were to pay for just
two or three of them, I would literally be working at a loss. Because
I'm not attached to a university, I can't even get free access to most
of them in person..."

2.) 'WillyG': http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12192332

"...As a non-academic with a wide range of interests, it regularly
frustrates me that I can't get access to articles which would enable
me to more intelligently participate in public policy debates without
severely depleting my meagre income..."

3.) David Pavett - Retired Teacher
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12192460

"...I have often found when following up references that I hit a
financial wall when it comes to reading academic articles. This can't
be right - as GM says, we have paid for this work through our taxes.
The means exist to make all this material available to everyone
electronically. It is an outrage that private interests have control
of the work blocking the rest of us from accessing it..."

4.) 'Ellis': http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12193330

"...I recently paid $30 (read only, available for 24 hours) to get
access to a tedious, useless piece of tat published in a "learned
journal" in the sixties. In any scholarly work of history there are
hundreds of references to journal articles, most of them literally
inaccessible except through University libraries.

Everything should be put online..." [Open Access]

5.) 'Silverwhistle' - Independent Researcher
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12193372

"...I'm attempting to continue my research and writing despite being
in low-paid temp work, sometimes alternating with unemployment. I have
a medi?val history article due out next year..."

6.) 'Makropulos' - Independent Researcher
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12193928

"...it's also become prohibitively expensive for any researcher
working outside the university sector to access this [JSTOR]
material."

7.) 'hisbigal' - Graduate Student (?)
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12194371

"... it would be a lot easier if such to academic journals weren't so
restricted, because the fees for downloading and prinitng are nothing
short of extortionate..."

8.) Mike Brisco - Senior Researcher, Flinders University, Australia
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12194540
contact: mike.brisco at flinders.edu.au

"...The shift to electronic form, has restricted access, narrowed it,
made it harder. Quite the opposite of what we predicted..."

9.) RichardRemlap - ????

"...I recently sought on-line for a copy of a scientific article, only
to find that I could download it for around $41 from Elsevier.
Fortunately I was able to buy a copy from the library of my
professional body for around ?10. While good for me, not everyone has
this option..."

10.) Ron White - Retired, Independent Researcher
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12195272

"...It is quite impossible for me to afford the extortionate charges
for access to journal articles..."

11.) Elliott Bignell - elliott at bignell.demon.co.uk
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12196899

"...This has been bugging me for a while, as well. Apart from the
sheer cost of accessing original sources, which as a result I rarely
get to do, it conflicts with the principle of openness to independent
review and replication..."

12.) 'windswept' -
http://www.guardian.co.uk/discussion/comment-permalink/12197383

"...I pay ?475 a year for membership of the London Library, and this
is mostly so I can use their online electronic library, which includes
specialist publications such as George writes about. Accessing
articles as a private individual would be unaffordable..."

13.) Andrew N Holding - Research Scientist, Cambridge

"...I recall in my PhD the stress of when I couldn't get an article
because my University didn't subscribe to it. Only to pay for a copy
from the British Library and find the whole article worthless as it
was a misleading reference..."


Best,

Ross

We need as many as we can get, I think. That will encourage others and also
give us material to give us facts

We also need to get Graham Steel and Gilles Frydman involved. I think we
have to have a pipeline now so that it doesnt overwhelm us. We may also
need to get sub-editors

We always need more :)
We should check out Mike's article comment threads as well. Graham and
Gilles have put the word out, I've had quite a few people respond from
Gilles' call, there should be another story up tonight.

The journalists I know tell me they get media accreditation
and can access whatever they want...

Well, that sounds like a good question to ask Ally.

Perhaps recognised 'Science Journalists' get the access-clearance okay
100% of the time, whilst more tangentially academia-related
journalists / irregular freelancers, asking for access to a 6-year old
articles related to a
current story find it tougher...?

I think this is also very much part of the problem with paywalls -
even if there *are* commonly used ways around them available - people
don't always know of these ways. Thus they see a paywall, then give
up. Very sad really.

Comment:

 I added Q2A to our blog farm and activated it for access.okfn.org. Now
 some admin of the blog need to [http://access.okfn.org/wp-
 admin/edit.php?post_type=question&page=settings configure] the plugin.

 I hope that all works fine and close.

NOT FIXED I am admin for the blog but there is no settings tab for the
plugin and when I follow the edit php? link the message page not found
appears.
Same thing for adding a question and trying to save.
I think something in the install went wrong and the path is unknown as a
result of this

In German. Reasons for re-use OA and my mantra "Make all
research results CC-BY":

(1) Data mining, see already
http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/4851871/ (in English)

(2) Educational use, see GSU case and "Open Education"
movement

(3) Open Content projects (e.g. Wikimedia projects)

(4) Re-Use of heritage items and scholarly
photographs/illustrations: not possible if CC-NC and
publication in commercial journal

(5) More chance for impact if commercial use

(6) Translations

(7) Wiki-re-use of materials

(8) Orphans

(9) Mirroring in repositories - LOCKSS principle

(10) We need more remix experiments

Summary: CC-BY as default license.

Best,
Klaus
