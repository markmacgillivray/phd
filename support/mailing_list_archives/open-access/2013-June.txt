Hi all,

Wanted to point you to this interesting insight in the open access
discussion, this time from a publisher's perspective.

Have a nice weekend.

Cheers,

Subject: [Open-access] Hacking education & science in Paris this summer :)
Message-ID: <CANACerFiQbb059mHjH4yEVmcXhQY2uKneEL5e6UrRpgNpdw2Fw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm delighted to invite you this summer at our event, NightScience. It's to
be held between July 12 and 14, in Paris.

The focus is 'hacking education', and the program encompasses a day of
talks and 2 days of hands-on activities (a hackathon). Quite a few names
you know well are to be noted among whom is Cameron Neylon :)

Our aim is to bridge the gap between 'formal' and 'informal' knowledge
creators and craft novel tools and content that are open, free (as in
'freedom', not as in 'free beer'), co-created & evolvable.

For further details, check out our website: http://nightscience.org/en/ and
follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Nightscience

Looking forward to welcoming you in Paris :)
Rayna

Dear Joris,

It is a pity that I've just realize about this today, sorry ;-) In the
Spanish world there is a very interesting editorial approach to openness
and how they are making profit for producing a high quality magazine
(almost 1kg each issue) free of cost on the web without adds, where the
writers, artists, etc. can do whatever they want: no editorial line ;-)

The name of the magazine is Orsai <http://editorialorsai.com/> and I think
you will love it http://editorialorsai.com/revista/

The interesting approach of this magazine is that people actually pay the
magazine even before it is made and you don't know the actual contents of
it. I actually bought the first issue and people got very crazy about it
;-)

I found about this project on a blog post, actually everything started in a
blog by Hern?n Casciari, the co-founder of the magazine. In this blog post
he quit his jobs in two main newspapers (one from Spain and another one
from Argentina) and from several editorials like Plaza Jane or Grijalbo,
very popular in the Spanish speaking countries. The blog post was amazing
and engaging, basically because they wanted to create a magazine for
readers by readers, so they basically quit their jobs and started working
on the idea. The first issue was bought by 10,000 people without knowing
anything about the contents.

You can buy the magazine or wait 10 days to get the PDF version for free,
so you can read it in your e-book, tablet or laptop. They are shipping to
all latin american countries, and the cost is exactly the cost of 15
newspapers in the country that wants the magazine. This is very
interesting, because for example some big editorials do not ever ship some
books to small countries, so it is not possible for them to buy it. Their
shipping model is also interesting because the readers are in charge of
deliver the issues to their colleagues, in words of Hern?n Casciari: we are
killing the intermediary.

The success of this story is really beautiful. Now they have opened an
editorial where all the authors receive 50% of the benefits of their
products, they want people to copy, remix, etc. the contents and even a bar
model where the readers again, are the main investors for the business
model.

I think this story is beautiful and if this is happening in the Spanish
humanities, why not in science?

All the best,

Daniel

Hi All

Just a reminder that the deadline for JISC elevator awards is coming up if
you know any students who have a teaching/research tech idea they'd like
funded!
Brendan (cc'd), an Oxford Open Science attendee, is pitching for WikiNets -
project description below.

If you have comments I'm sure he would be interested - and even more so if
you wanted to vote for the project ;)
Please do shout out if you've made an entry yourself, it would be great to
hear about it.

Jenny

WikiNets - Mapping the Research Frontier, Together

The Idea
Research is all about the big picture. WikiNets is a way of drawing the big
picture. It?s an online tool for piecing together the contributions of many
researchers into a graphical form that is easy to read, understand, and
remember. WikiNets does this by facilitating the collaborative creation of
annotated networks that represent all relevant variables in a domain of
research, and their relationships. Imagine a streamlined Wikipedia, built
to focus on the links.

Hi everyone,

Here is another good example submitted by Emanuil Tolev, it proposes to
help students find funding for postgraduate study / research. Have a look
and give him a vote if you like the idea:

First of all congratulations to OKFN for getting this funding. (I knew this
was happening but couldn't say anything).

When we set up the first PFs we considered making available to anyone, but
the administrative details for managing this were too complex at that stage
for what was a small amount of management resource. We decided to start
with the UK where we had the legal and financial structure and to look to
expand later.

I am delighted that we have been able to expand to the EU. Who knows what
will be possible in the future? One hope is that we'll find increasing
numbers of funders and these may have geographical interests.

My life has been enormously enriched by working with Sophie and Ross and
I'm really looking forward to seeing the next round of applications.

P.

And I'll take the opportunity to remind everyone about the impending
deadline for submissions to the Veni Competition, which is open to
everyone.

With the deadline on *27 June *and a total prize fund* of 5.000 EUR*, the
Veni Competition is looking for prototypes and demos that use linked and/or
open data for educational purposes. Find out more on our website: http://
linkedup-challenge.org/, or feel free to ping me an email.

Best wishes,

Hi Prakash,

Yes, I'm afraid if you read the full eligibility guidelines here:
http://pantonprinciples.org/panton-fellowships/, the Fellowships are only
open to applicants from within the EU region.

Sorry.

I think it would be administratively difficult for OKF & CCIA to offer the
fellowships outside of this region. However, if the scheme continues to be
a success, perhaps in later years it might be possible to have Panton
Fellows across the world...?

Regards,

Ross

Message-ID: <51C4236F.6020403@scinoptica.com>

Dear lists,


at the OAI8 conference in Geneva Daniel Beucke and I yesterday moderated 
a Breakout Group on AltMetrics. The discussion focused on steps to 
improve the acceptance of AltMetrics. We tried to record the results in 
a mindmap that you'll find under
http://www.scinoptica.com/pages/topics/mindmap-acceptance-of-altmetrics.php
or https://bubbl.us/?h=181824/2f1f72/15uRiisvqzWIo

Unfortunately we did not use an open tool to produce this map and it is 
not possible to edit the map for unregistered users. Nevertheless we 
would be very glad if you could give some feedback, via mail or twitter, 
our accounts are @dmetje (Daniel) or @scinoptica (me).

Best regards

Ulrich

 non-commercial 'data analysis' published for comment
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzstnEPtLp1Ufw+GoHAtxN9kivpqKfD6aDpfOMQFtL0UQ@mail.gmail.com>

The UK Intellectual Propert Office (IPO) has released some draft
legislation for technical review that may be of interest. It concerns new
allowances for:

1.) 'non-commercial data analysis' (which I would assume to specifically
include text mining and content mining).
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/techreview-data-analysis.pdf

2.) exceptions for education
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/techreview-education.pdf

3.) exceptions for research libraries and archives
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/techreview-research-library.pdf


The IPO welcomes answers to the questions posed in each document and any
specific drafting suggestions by 2 August 2013. Comments can be submitted
by email to copyrightconsultation at ipo.gov.uk

The IPO will also be holding a series of open meetings in the week
commencing 22 July 2013 to give an opportunity for discussion of the
drafts. Numbers will be limited so you are advised to book your place by
emailing copyrightconsultation at ipo.gov.uk.

Hi folks,

Here?s another monster FOSsil Bank Update. I?ve split it into two parts,
the second of which I?ll post next week.

As always, please get in touch if you?ve found any libre or shareable
content and I?ll chuck it on the wiki.
#FundFreeCulture

There is just three days left on the Subaqueous: USB Splash Drive and Remix
Album Kickstarter<http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cotec/subaqueous-usb-splash-drive-and-remix-album>.
I?ve listened to some of this music and it?s pretty good ? I hope it makes
the $200 it needs for it (stems and finished songs) to go CC BY-SA. (3 days
left; $1,975/$2,222)

The second Future of Copyright Contest has begun raising funds on
IndieGoGo<http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/future-of-copyright-contest-2-0>.
Already a proven
success<http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/future-of-copyright-contest>
from
last year. (CC BY-SA; 15 days left; $400/$500)

Assets from an abandoned Blender game project are being ransomed on
IndieGoGo.<http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/free-game-resources-for-blender-3d-and-more?c=home>
Quite
a few assets have already been shared. (CC0; 6 days left; $675/$500)

Data Dealer  <http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cuteacute/data-dealer>is
an online game about collecting and selling personal data. (CC BY-SA; 18
days left; $5,951/$50,000)

Lunduke <http://lunduke.com/?p=4446>, a game designer and comic creator, is
releasing all of his works as libre to try to make a living off of it.

Thanks Ross,
This is very timely and useful from the IPO.
I think we should address the points in some detail and try to anticipate
possible problems.

I think possible areas not covered include:

* technological access to large amounts of material (i.e. the right to
crawl)
* the need to quote substantial parts of the work for scholarly purposes
(i.e faithful to the original text).
* the need to make annotated corpora available for reference (certainly at
the section level - e.g. the whole of "materials and methods").
* the right to extract information from diagrams and tables and other
e-media such as recordings.

I would not like to outline what we MAY do as this implies that anything
else is forbidden.

My internet is flaky for several days but will try to read/respond.

This is a VERY important area and I think the OKF should have a clear
compelling statement.

THEY have to do this as NC because they can do this without a new act - NC
would require parliament. So  it's valuable.

I don't see how it's really going to grant much, if any, new usage rights.

I think we can extract data and pulbish it with a CC0 licence and a
statement that an "The IPO adds an NC restriction". If IPO objects they can
tell us to stop. If the original licence holder wants to challenge this
then that's their problem...  Yes, messy, but a big start.

So it sounds like they think counting words should be legislated
differently from plain old reading.

If they are scrupulous about enforcing the non-commercial aspect of this, I
don't see how it's really going to grant much, if any, new usage rights.
 Pretty much all research gets commercialized at some point -- well, unless
it's about Shakespeare or something.

Dear lists,

Jenny Molloy has just written-up a cracking blog post about the
recent ?Rigour and Openness in 21st Century Science' conference on the
*main* OKF blog:
http://blog.okfn.org/2013/06/25/rigour-and-openness-in-21st-century-science/

It comes complete with full youtube videos of many of the great talks given
including those by Sir Mark Walport, David Willetts MP, The Evolution or
Revolution? Debate, Chas Bountra on open innovation, and Helen Roy on
citizen science.

Please do give it a read and disseminate widely!

Best,
