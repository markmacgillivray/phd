Thanks for these, Tom, but because they're in German they're not
something I can really do anything to publicise.  If you could do an
@ccess blog post about them (in English!) that would help to bring
them into the broader English-language discussion, especially in light
of David Willetts' comments on partering with EU countries on OA.  I'd
be able to use that in subsequent writings.

I'm sorry, but one of our weekly meetings had to move to
that date so I won't be able to make it to calls at that
date and time.

Sorry,

Mike,

OK, I will do that as soon as I can find the time.

BTW I read the nature blog comment series Harnad <---> you yourself  liked
your comments!
It is really apparent that open access according to Harnad is something
quite different from @ccess.
We have to make absolutely clear in our @ccess article that gratis, green,
even libre aren't enough for open science to happen, and that we want @ccess

cheers

Well, I agree on Gratis and even on Libre (since the usually reliable
Peter Suber collaborated with Harnad on giving it that
doesn't-mean-anything-specific-at-all definition).  But I'm not sure I
understand your objection to Green.  While Gratis-vs.- at ccess is about
WHAT you get, surely Green-vs.-Gold is only about HOW you get it?

This is technically correct Mike. The problem is that very few Green
deposition are technically CC-BY. So almost always "Green" means - a
self-archived manuscript (of some sort) without explicit licence or with a
licence that forbids re-use. So the language slips to equate Green with
non-reusable.

As an example of re-usable green BMC is archiving my papers in our repo.
They are CC-BY in BMC - Gold. When they get into the Cambridge repo they
will be Green. They may not have a licence and Cambridge - like other univs
- stamps everything as non-reusable. But they could be Green CC-BY if
people put the effort in.

My objection to Green is exactly what Peter says, it is unclear about
restrictions. And often repository papers are CC-BY-NC or no license
Also Gold is not per definition good, because there the only sure thing is
the source (publisher) and not open accessness.Gold can be free and
unrestricted but also free and somewhat restricted.  In fact all the
colours, green, gold, yellow,blue and flavours gratis and libre are not
sufficient for the kind of BOAI Open Access that is needed for open
science. Therefore still the case for @ccess.

Well, let's be clear ourselves.  There is nothing about Green that
means it has to be unclear about restricts; and conversely there is
nothing about Gold that means it does not.  For example, one of my
favourite palaeontology journals, Acta Palaeontologica Polonica is
free to read (and free to authors, but that's beside the point).  But
it doesn't specify what licence the content is made available under.

So implicit vs. explicit, like gratis vs. libre, is orthogonal to
green vs. gold.  And while we would all agree that explicit is better
than implicit and libre is better than gratis, I am still not seeing
an *intrinsic* reason for strongly preferring green over gold.

Of course it may well be the case that green is more often implicit
about terms than gold is; and that would certainly be something to fix
about those specific green repositories.  But it's not the fault of
green itself.  Correlation does not imply causality.

Message-ID: <CAGyWN8YxtVou-S3WK975+sgp0+51yC-zDZVXXYO+MkpD5gRxdg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Bjoern,

Also Mark McGillivray has meetings on Friday., perhaps others have
difficulties with this time as well?

Is it an idea to do the Skype meetings on Thursdays as off next week?

I agree. You can have CC-BY with green OA and "All rights reserved"
with gold. Green has a format problem because most scholars doens'nt
want cite final drafts instead of publisher's pdf.

Yes.  As I said in a comment on the Nature News article, the only
concrete thing you lose by using a Green OA publication is the
publisher's official page-numbers.  Which is not such a big price to
pay, and one that will become even less of an issue when we all start
using section and subsection numbers, like computer scientists do.

Proper libre (as in F/OSS not the Suber-Harnad misuse) requires an explicit
statement of freedom.

The problem is we are dealing with the result fo 10 years of misuse of
terminology. That makes it very difficult to use the terminology to
describe the problem. While we make be correct in what we say, many people
will not understand us correctly.

We discussed at one stage trying to reclaim usage. I am not hopeful of
doing this while the main players confuse issues. By all means we can
describe what we mean in the current terms..

As long as it is made clear that a pub is CC-BY or @ccess the only
difference between green and gold is in fact  that with green scientists
hold the power in their own hands, which I think is to be preferred.
For me the discussion about implicit and explicit freedom for reading,
using and reusing is not trivial, open access as such is not clear and that
is not good.

Well.  The phrase "libre OA" was coined by the Suber/Harnad menu, so
they get to define what that means.  Adding our own term "proper libra
OA" will only exacerbate the confusion.  I think Tom's approach is
better: recognise that the meaning of "libre OA" is so vague as to be
useless, and explicitly say BOAI-compliant, or @ccess, instead.

(Honestly, what was Peter thinking?  It's bad enough that that memo
watered down the meaning of OA by introducing gratis to the
conversation; but ALSO watering down libre to mean less and OA itself
meant in the original coinage -- that was a seriously wrongheaded
manoeuvre.)

True.  This is why I have adopted the term "BOAI-compliant" for more purposes.

Yes.

Last week I asked if there were objections to change the weekly calls to
thursdays.
Only Bjoern and Jenny have reacted.
I had taken this action because Bjoern had indicated that he could not ever
attend on fridays. Since  he also can not attend THIS thursday but can
attend all other thursdays as off next week the weekly  Skype will be on
friday this week for one last time.
Agenda will follow.

Dear open-access

Please see a message from John Wilbanks and the access2research team below
- they are aiming to generate a big splash this Monday and you may have got
an inkling of what was coming through #OAMonday tweets, but it's arrived
and they need your help!

This message contains info on social media links and handles so do make use
of them if you can and get the word out there.

Best wishes

Jenny

--------------------------------------------------------------

On *Monday, May 21*, we lodge a petition on the White House?s ?We the
People? page asking the Obama administration to require that all federally
funded research be posted on the Web ? extending the principle of the NIH
policy to all federal agencies.

1. What We?re Asking

? Publicity/ Call for Participation.  Please help line up publicity for the
petition before Monday.  Specifically, can you help get it on the front
pages of Reddit, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Boing Boing, and send out an
all-hands-on-deck request through your own blogs/twitter feeds, etc?

? 25,000 signatures in 30 days gets an official Administration response.
 We want to hit that number fast to escalate this issue inside the White
House.  We believe the policy has support but is stuck.  This could well be
the event that gets it through.

? Please sign the petition on Monday.

2. Social Media links/handles

The official campaign website is at http://access2research.org and there
are already Facebook pages
(http://facebook.com/**access2research<http://facebook.com/access2research>)
and Twitter handles (@access2research) in place.

3. Petition Text (800 character limit)

WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO: [This doesn't count toward the
character count]

Require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from
taxpayer-funded research.

We believe in the power of the Internet to foster innovation, research, and
education. Requiring the published results of taxpayer-funded research to
be posted on the Internet would give access to entrepreneurs, researchers,
patients, caregivers, and students, who currently are blocked by high
costs. We know this works without disturbing the process of scientific
publishing because the National Institutes of Health is already doing it
through its highly successful Public Access Policy. All other federal
agencies that fund research should have similar policies.

President Obama, please act now to make federally-funded research freely
available to taxpayers on the Internet.

4. The Ask to Others

To sign the petition:

-   Have to be 13 years or older
-   Have to create an account on whitehouse.gov, which requires giving a
name and an email address and then clicking the validation link sent to
that address
-   Click to sign

5. Further Context

After years of work on promoting policy change to make federally-funded
research available on the Internet, and after winning the battle to
implement a public access policy at NIH, it has become clear that being on
the right side of the issue is necessary but not sufficient. We've had the
meetings, done the hearings, replied to the requests for information.

But we're opposed in our work by a small set of publishers who profit
enormously from the existing system, even though there is no evidence that
the NIH policy has had any measurable impact on their business models. They
can - and do - outspend those of us who have chosen to make a huge part of
our daily work the expansion of access to knowledge. This puts the idea of
access at a disadvantage. We know there is a serious debate about the
extension of public access to taxpayer funded research going on right now
in the White House, but we also know that we need more than our current
 approaches to get that extension made into federal policy.

The best approach that we have yet to try is to make a broad public appeal
for support, straight to the people. The Obama Administration has created a
web platform to petition the White House directly called We The People. Any
petition receiving more than 25,000 digital signatures is placed on the
desk of the President's Chief of Staff and must be integrated into policy
and political discussions. But there's a catch - a petition only has 30
days to gather the required number of signatures to qualify.

We can get 25,000 signatures. And if we not only get 25,000, but an order
of magnitude more, we can change the debate happening right now.

Next week we will publish our petition and the 30 day cycle begins. What
we're asking you to do is to leverage your personal and professional
networks to get the word out.

You can do this in any way that makes you feel comfortable. A blog post, an
email to constituencies, a tweet, a facebook share, you name it - something
that tells thousands of people "I support this petition, I'm signing this
petition, and I thought you should know about it too." Because this isn't
just slacktivism with a "like" or a retweet - people need to go to the
White House website, enter their name and email address, and hit the button.

Qualified signers must be 13 years old or more, and have a valid email
address. That's all.

The goal is not just to get 25,000, but to get far more to show the White
House that this issue matters to people, not just a few publishers.

We are launching the campaign on Monday May 21. The petition will go live
late Sunday night May 20, so that the waves can start in the EU and sweep
west with the sunrise. We're asking you to turn on your networks on Monday
morning.

Thanks for considering this. If we can all come together to get the word
out at once, and stay behind it for 30 days, we have a real chance to get
access to taxpayer funded research across the entire government, and send a
signal that the people have a voice in this debate, not just publishers and
activists.

Hi all,

Please see below for an update from Kat Braybrooke on the progress of
OKFest.

Thanks to all who helped us to put together our OKFest submission. We have
been partnered with the Open Education folk, and will be participating in
OKFest as part of the 'Open Research and Education' stream. This should be
great, and there are many exciting opportunities for collaboration.

The 'Guest Programming Planners' (those of us who signed up on the etherpad
to help organise the stream!) will be meeting next Tuesday to discuss how
best to move things forward. We will keep you all in the loop as plans
develop :)

If you have any questions or suggestions in the meantime, drop me a line
and we'll make sure your voice gets heard! Equally if anyone would like to
join the Planning Committee, do let me know.

All the best,
Laura

message of congratulations - we were highly impressed by your topic
submissions in the 1st Call for Proposals and would like you to be a part
of the festival's organising team!

As many of you have already seen, we have now confirmed the 13 key Topic
Streams of 2012, one of which is *Open Education and Access*. As the Lead
for this topic, I therefore ask if you are willing to come together to be
its Guest Programming Planners <details: http://bit.ly/guest_planner_**
instructions <http://bit.ly/guest_planner_instructions>>.

Our reasoning behind the combining of these concepts is based on the high
quality of submissions we've received related to open access, science,
academia and research - and the fact that we believe much of your
already-impressive work will be made even more enriched by collaborating
around these ideas and finding both commonalities and uniqueness through
this process. Your backgrounds include the Open Knowledge Foundation,
Cambridge University, University of Southampton, Aalto University and other
Finnish educational institutes, Creative Commons - and you have proposed
programme elements related to Open Design, Open Access, Open Data Research,
and Open Education (see Etherpad below for details). I believe there's much
that can happen with such a venerable group.

I've booted up an Etherpad with all of your proposals so everyone can see
everyone else's work, and start discussing best ways to collaborate:
http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/OpenResearchAndEducation I'd also recommend
that we get a Facebook group started as the Open Democracy and Citizen
Movement Topic Stream has just done <see here:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendemocracy.okfest/>, so we can start
introducing ourselves to each other and bring new participants in.

The next steps are:

01) We'll need a confirmation ASAP that you're willing to work together as
Guest Programme Planners for this stream. If so, please send us the names
of 1-3 leaders who serve as public representatives and help with the
coordination of this group.

02) Please also read through our Guest Programme Planner handbook and let
me know if you have any questions: http://bit.ly/guest_planner_**
instructions <http://bit.ly/guest_planner_instructions>

03) Lastly, we will be publishing the last Call for Proposals on Monday, so
it would be great to see activity from your organisers on the Public
OKFestival Wiki by the end of next week, to be of use to those who plan to
submit sessions. We're especially looking for a description of who you'd
like to join your team (hackers, teachers, people from universities, etc):
http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/helsinki

Please reply to the whole group so we can start this discussion. I look
forward to it!

Kat

Hi all,

Just noted a tweet by Amsterdam University Press about an accessability
Quotient

"The Accessibility Quotient: A New Measure of Open Access" by Mathew A.
Willmott, Katharine H. Dunn et al.http://jlsc-pub.org/jlsc/vol1/iss1/7/

let me know what you think in view of our Malaria Index in the making.

Looks interesting, and something we should keep in mind, however not
exactly the same as our intent - focusses on depts of a particular
institute for their example, and refers to RPI for some reason.

Hi All,

A week full of open access started last monday. Let's talk about this and
other actions that WE are working on.

Start of the call 1.30 pm UTC+1  (mainly because Bjoern only has time then,
) the feedback I got last week was that this time would be OK

Hello members of the open-access list,
I am new in this list, Dominique from Argentina.  My first message is to
share with you the annoucement that a national open access legislation, for
State funded research results to be deposited in digital repositories with
maximum embargo of six months, has received a preliminary approval
yesterday by Deputies in our Congress, and now will be discussed and we
hope approved by the Senate soon.
The legislation proposal has been an initiative of the Ministry of Science
and Technology, with participation of the Repositories National System
Experts Committee.
The announcement published yesterday (in Spanish)
http://www.mincyt.gov.ar/noticias/noticias_detalles.php?id_noticia=959
It is a very imporant step forward in a region where 2/3 of research is
State funded.
Dominique

If you/Ministry can ensure that "Open Access" means compliant with  "CC-BY"
or "BOAI" that will be a very major step forward.

Hi Dominique,

I also wellcome you to the @ccess group.
I have posted your information on google + emphasizing the not widely known
fact that 2/3 of research in Argentina is State funded.
Thanks for your input

In Latin America 2/3 of research is State funded and this has great impact
in "real" open access developments in the region (no charge for users, no
charge for authors, because journals are part of the research process
funding, in direct or indirect way)
I have prepared for UNESCO Global Open Access Portal a summary of OA in
Latin America Caribbean and profile of main
projects<http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/portals-and-platforms/goap/access-by-region/latin-america-and-the-caribbean/>,
for anyone interested in our region

Graf, Klaus, Thatcher, Sandy (2012). Point & Counterpoint: Is CC BY
the Best Open Access License?. Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly
Communication 1(1):eP1043.
Available at: http://jlsc-pub.org/jlsc/vol1/iss1/5

Many thanks to Isaac Gilman who transformed my English in something readable!

My opinion piece is licensed under CC-BY while Mr Thatchers text has
the CC-BY-NC license. I reproduce here only my part:

"The only aim of scholarly communication should be the widest possible
distribution of knowledge and scholarly results. In order for
this to be possible, published research?which scholars give away for
free to publishers?should be open access. And in this context,
?gratis? open access (free to access) isn?t enough; only ?libre? open
access, which removes permission barriers, allows the widest
distribution of knowledge.

Before considering which Creative Commons license best meets this
requirement, it is worth considering the role of copyright in general.
We should ask whether copyright even has a valid function in the
context of science and scholarship. Ideas, principles and scientific
results aren?t protected by the copyright. And reputation is the
currency in science, not money. No researcher needs an incentive (such
as that provided in copyright law) to do research or to publish his
results. Copyright, with its restrictions, simply isn?t an appropriate
instrument in this sector. ?The only constraint on reproduction and
distribution, and the only role for copyright in this domain,? says
the Budapest Open Access Initiative (2001), ?should be to give authors
control over the integrity of their work and the right to be properly
acknowledged and cited.?

The Creative Commons Attribution license (CC BY) is the license
which best fits this description?as well as the criteria of the other
authoritative Open Access definitions of Bethesda and Berlin (2001-
2003), and the definition of the Open Knowledge Foundation [1]. CC
BY is the ?little brother? of the public domain; it makes re-use as
easy as possible (the attribution requirement is not a significant
barrier).

Furthermore, CC BY is accepted as the means of ensuring libre open
access by the most prestigious open access publishers: Public Library
of Science and BioMedCentral (now part of Springer). If Hindawi and
other publishers who use the CC BY license are included, there must be
thousands of authors using the license (keep in mind that, since 2003,
PloS has published since nearly 50,000 articles). If there are
problems with this license, they are not apparent.

Others say that other Creative Commons licenses/terms, like No
Derivatives or Non-Commercial Use, are just as appropriate for open
content. However:

?	 No Derivatives (ND) isn?t an option for scholarly publications.
Scholars and scientists build upon the work of their
predecessors, to stand on their shoulders. To forbid derivative
works doesn?t make sense if science and scholarship are to be
seen as collaborative work.

?	 Non-Commercial Use (NC) isn?t an option either. To choose a
non-commercial license would mean that, e.g., an image in a
CC BY-NC journal could not be re-used in a scholarly journal
published by a commercial publisher. Course pack use of NC
articles is also problematic if the university acts commercially
and charges for the course. And let?s not forget: commercial
use can mean more impact for a work.

CC BY also solves the problem of orphan (or semi-orphan) works.
Some countries like Germany don?t have full copyright transfer to
publishers. Contacting authors is therefore necessary in order to
obtain re-use rights. However, it can be difficult to find scientific
authors because of the common use of initials instead of first names
in article metadata. And in the humanities (which do use first names)
it isn?t always easy to get current contact information 10 or more
years after an article is published.

There is, I must concede, some loss of control for authors when using
the CC BY license. One can, for example, publish a translation of an
article without asking the author, and the author may not like the
translation. But this is a minor disadvantage given the great
potential of this license. To quote Google in regard to its Public
Domain Books: ?Your imagination is the limit.? We cannot know the
possible benefits in the next decades but we know (especially from the
example of orphan works) that permission barriers are evil.
The ?all rights reserved? approach isn?t a substitute for ethical
conduct in science or scholarship. The CC BY license is the expression
of a culture of respect and appropriate attribution, while ?all rights
reserved? is a ridiculous attempt to try to control things you cannot
control and to ignore the fact that the rules of the copyright system
and the rules of the research community are different. All research
results should be made CC BY (and all data CC 0).

If open access, then libre open access. If libre open access, then CC
BY!"

We are in the twenty-first century and this is now mainstream culture -
responsible re-use. People may use my work to argue in ways I believe are
fallacious but these should be challenged in the court of public opinion,
not the court of law (which is the only thing that copyright understands).

Thanks for this.
I have been heavily involved in Open Access and think the account on this
page is accurate. It is important to continue to stress that "libre" in the
Open Access world is not a conventional use of the term and in my opinion
causes confusion and damage, not least because publishers charge (often
5000 USD)  for "fully open access" which is merely gratis.

I have copied this to the OKF open-access list. We try to encourage the use
of either "BOAI-compliant" or "OKD-compliant" as the term "open Access" is
operationally meaningless.

Hello,

I am also convinced of the great importance of licences and I think it
does not have the place it deserves in discussions/debates.
I claimed similar positions to yours in a french working group (At
April, www.april.org).

Instead of using the term "open acess", I rather prefer to speak about
FLOA, short for Free Libre Open Access; like FLOSS.
Sementics, as underlined by Richard Stallman, is crucial in debates and
probably the source of future traps or misunderstanding. For instance,
companies might use the word Open Source whereas it does not refer to a
Free Software.
I am waiting the day an article will be published in png and it will be
claimed to be in "open access".

Klaus, you do not discuss about copyleft. I am currently unable to give
an answer on it. Do you think CC BY SA is acceptable. If not, why
copyleft is for you a problem?

Subject: [Open-access] access2research - just over 5000 signatures to go
Message-ID: <CABPM+wrdeA_1HsXAbnx_VG_w1OO_6EmOPhXC+BQdEhXQdPQnCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Many of you will have already heard of the http://access2research.org petition
to encourage the White House to consider further opening up of access to
scientific publications.

https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ

This is endorsed by the OKFN
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/05/21/petition-the-white-house-to-open-up-publicly-funded-research/
and
it would be fantastic to see as many of our supporters as possible signing
and encouraging others to do the same - they are edging towards the 20,000
mark and require just over 5,000 more signatures by June 19 to guarantee a
response from the administration.

You do not need to be American, just over the age of 13 with an easily
created whitehouse.gov account.

Many more details below for those willing to spread the word around their
social networks and thanks very much to those who already have!

Jenny

--------------------------------------------------------------

On *Monday, May 21*, we lodge a petition on the White House?s ?We the
People? page asking the Obama administration to require that all federally
funded research be posted on the Web ? extending the principle of the NIH
policy to all federal agencies.

1. What We?re Asking

? Publicity/ Call for Participation.  Please help line up publicity for the
petition before Monday.  Specifically, can you help get it on the front
pages of Reddit, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Boing Boing, and send out an
all-hands-on-deck request through your own blogs/twitter feeds, etc?

? 25,000 signatures in 30 days gets an official Administration response.
 We want to hit that number fast to escalate this issue inside the White
House.  We believe the policy has support but is stuck.  This could well be
the event that gets it through.

? Please sign the petition on Monday.

2. Social Media links/handles

The official campaign website is at http://access2research.org and there
are already Facebook pages
(http://facebook.com/**access2research<http://facebook.com/access2research>)
and Twitter handles (@access2research) in place.

3. Petition Text (800 character limit)

WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO: [This doesn't count toward the
character count]

Require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from
taxpayer-funded research.

We believe in the power of the Internet to foster innovation, research, and
education. Requiring the published results of taxpayer-funded research to
be posted on the Internet would give access to entrepreneurs, researchers,
patients, caregivers, and students, who currently are blocked by high
costs. We know this works without disturbing the process of scientific
publishing because the National Institutes of Health is already doing it
through its highly successful Public Access Policy. All other federal
agencies that fund research should have similar policies.

President Obama, please act now to make federally-funded research freely
available to taxpayers on the Internet.

4. The Ask to Others

To sign the petition:

-   Have to be 13 years or older
-   Have to create an account on whitehouse.gov, which requires giving a
name and an email address and then clicking the validation link sent to
that address
-   Click to sign

5. Further Context

After years of work on promoting policy change to make federally-funded
research available on the Internet, and after winning the battle to
implement a public access policy at NIH, it has become clear that being on
the right side of the issue is necessary but not sufficient. We've had the
meetings, done the hearings, replied to the requests for information.

But we're opposed in our work by a small set of publishers who profit
enormously from the existing system, even though there is no evidence that
the NIH policy has had any measurable impact on their business models. They
can - and do - outspend those of us who have chosen to make a huge part of
our daily work the expansion of access to knowledge. This puts the idea of
access at a disadvantage. We know there is a serious debate about the
extension of public access to taxpayer funded research going on right now
in the White House, but we also know that we need more than our current
 approaches to get that extension made into federal policy.

The best approach that we have yet to try is to make a broad public appeal
for support, straight to the people. The Obama Administration has created a
web platform to petition the White House directly called We The People. Any
petition receiving more than 25,000 digital signatures is placed on the
desk of the President's Chief of Staff and must be integrated into policy
and political discussions. But there's a catch - a petition only has 30
days to gather the required number of signatures to qualify.

We can get 25,000 signatures. And if we not only get 25,000, but an order
of magnitude more, we can change the debate happening right now.

Next week we will publish our petition and the 30 day cycle begins. What
we're asking you to do is to leverage your personal and professional
networks to get the word out.

You can do this in any way that makes you feel comfortable. A blog post, an
email to constituencies, a tweet, a facebook share, you name it - something
that tells thousands of people "I support this petition, I'm signing this
petition, and I thought you should know about it too." Because this isn't
just slacktivism with a "like" or a retweet - people need to go to the
White House website, enter their name and email address, and hit the button.

Qualified signers must be 13 years old or more, and have a valid email
address. That's all.

The goal is not just to get 25,000, but to get far more to show the White
House that this issue matters to people, not just a few publishers.

We are launching the campaign on Monday May 21. The petition will go live
late Sunday night May 20, so that the waves can start in the EU and sweep
west with the sunrise. We're asking you to turn on your networks on Monday
morning.

Thanks for considering this. If we can all come together to get the word
out at once, and stay behind it for 30 days, we have a real chance to get
access to taxpayer funded research across the entire government, and send a
signal that the people have a voice in this debate, not just publishers and
activists.

Hi all,

On the Open access call today, we proposed to have a catchup next week
specifically to discuss the findings from the malaria index and how that
data fits the proposed method for ranking open access journals in malaria.
Suggestions are Tuesday or Wednesday next week to cover this topic in more
detail, to report back on the usual call on Thursday.

Can all those interested please respond to this mail, and let us know
availability on, say, Wednesday morning next week? We expect at least me,
Ross Mounce, Daniel Mietchen, Tom Olijhoek will wish to join, but it is
open to anyone.

Message-ID: <CAGyWN8ZupGt6M_5mJ1C9q89VLYp1Hfpdh7jH_onPJZDccpZoNw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just finished the Skype call of the @ccess group.
We agreed to use this mailing list to discuss the idea of abandoning @ccess
as the term for "BOAI compliant open access"  and start using BBB-open
access or B3 Open Access.
I have summarized this below

 *@ccess versus open access*
 Did we do right to try and introduce the term @ccess for BOAI compliant
open access?
My vision: I think open access is already too well established and the term
@ccess stands no chance to become accepted,  so we should try to reclaim
the original meaning of the term open access
I propose to do this by introducing the term  BBB Open Access, I would
shorten this to B3 open access, and for LOGO / stamp we could use I3 open
access (a line with a 3 designed to show the B and the 3 in one sign)
see google docs https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B3qisbf4J8lTQk4xaXVFRmRldzQ

I still think we need a LOGO and depending on the feedback on this email we
could ask Sam Smith to help us design one.
He has offered to help the @ccess group with this recently.
.
Please tell if you want   A) a design based on the link above
       or                           B ) a completely new design


cheers

I prefer BBB Open Access. I think much people in the OA community are
familiar with the abbreviation BBB while B3 isn't quite popular ...

Thank you for raising this.  The following is from an incomplete draft
of a lbog entry I've been writing for SV-POW! for some time now. (It
would have been posted a week ago had Access2Research not blown
everything else out of the water.)


---- begin excerpt ----
HEADING: BOAI, BBB, "full open access", @ccess

To be more explicit about what particular rights are readers are given
regarding an open-access article, several terms have been used.

* The one I like best is BOAI-compliant, which refers explicitly back
to the Budapest initiative (and has the advantage of using an acronym
that can't be confused with anything else).

* You might also see BBB, which stands for Budapest/Berlin/Bethesda,
the names of three very similar open-access declarations.

* You occasionally even see the redundant BOAI/BBB.? Please don't.

* Phrases such as "full open access" and "true open access" are
sometimes used, but I'm not sure they help much because they are just
as prone to abuse as unadorned "open access".

* Finally, the @ccess group has started to use the term @ccess to
refer to BOAI compliance.? Although I am part of the @ccess group, I
am not convinced that adding yet another term has helped greatly.

So the unfortunate consequence of the unfortunate broadening of the
meaning of "open access" has been the coining of four or five
different terms all intended to indicate what was originally mean by
the original term.? Very unhelpful.
---- end excerpt ----


I prefer BOAI-compliant over BBB-compliant because when a single
definition is used, it's more explicit, there are other BBBs but no
other BOAIs, there is no scope for running into a dark corners where
the three Bs don't quite agree, and (maybe most important) there is a
single definitive place to link to when you want to tell people "this
is what the BOAI defined Open Access to be.

-- Mike.

Hi, guys.  I won't be on that call: the Malaria Index is very
important, but it's not an area where I have any real contribution to
make.

I agree with what Mike has written.

I also prefer BOAI as it's very easy to look up on the web and there is a
single definition to read

Ditto. All one needs to say is BOAI-compliant Open Access
and link to http://www.soros.org/openaccess/read  to define *exactly*
what one means. Clear and simple to me.
