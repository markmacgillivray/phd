Subject: [Open-access] Science Europe policy statement on the transition to
	Open Access
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEy4BKNLofYaOp6VEkvipoXaUtMFsO0hx8fz6P2KFAYDdQ@mail.gmail.com>

In case you haven't seen this on Twitter yet...

Science Europe have released an excellent short, clear & agreeable policy
statement on the transition to OA here:
http://www.scienceeurope.org/downloads
direct link to PDF:
http://www.scienceeurope.org/uploads/Public%20documents%20and%20speeches/SE_OA_Pos_Statement.pdf

I'm delighted they've backed the strong RCUK-like stance of allowing an
embargo/delay of only 6 months for non-AHSS research.
It also supports all good approaches to open access regardless of 'gold' or
'green' distinction, except in the case of the 'hybrid model' which it
rightfully pours scorn on.

(from the PDF below)

The Science Europe Member Organisations have agreed on the following vision
and principles:

With regard to Open Access to research publications, Science Europe Member
Organisations share the view that:

? publication and dissemination of results are an integral part of the
research process. The allocation of
resources within the research system must take this into account;
? Open Access to the published results of publicly-funded research will
have huge value for the research
community and will offer significant social and economic benefits to
potential users in industry, charitable and
public sectors, to individual professionals, and to the general public;
? Open Access, as defined in the Berlin Declaration, is not only about the
right of access, but also about the
opportunity to re-use information with as few restrictions as possible,
subject to proper attribution;
? the common goal of Science Europe Members is to shift to a research
publication system in which free
access to research publications is guaranteed, and which avoids undue
publication barriers. This involves a
move towards Open Access, replacing the present subscription system with
other publication models whilst
redirecting and reorganising the current resources accordingly.
Science Europe is committed to playing a role in accomplishing the
transition to Open Access as quickly as
possible, in an efficient and sustainable way, and thus avoiding
unnecessary costs. This transition process
must be as co-ordinated and transparent as possible.

Therefore the Science Europe Member Organisations:

? will continue to support any valid approaches to achieve Open Access,
including those commonly referred
to as the ?green? and ?gold? routes;
? recognise repositories and related facilities as key strategic research
infrastructure which should comply with
high quality standards;
? stress that research publications should either be published in an Open
Access journal or be deposited as soon as possible in a repository, and
made available in Open Access in all cases no later than six months
following first publication. In Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, the
delay may need to be longer than six
months but must be no more than 12 months;
? require that as part of the publication services provided against the
payment of Open Access publication
fees, effective mechanisms are in place to ensure that the publication of
research outputs is subject to rigorous
quality assurance;
? will co-ordinate efforts to ensure the efficient and cost effective use
of public funds, and combine
programmes for covering Open Access costs with budget control mechanisms
and to build up monitoring
systems for these costs;
? accept that it is essential that Open Access transactions need to be
managed efficiently, with the
co-operation of all parties involved;
? require that funding of Open Access publication fees is part of a
transparent cost structure, incorporating a
clear picture of publishers? service costs;
? expect publishers to apply institutional-, regional-, or country-based
reductions in journal subscriptions, in
line with increases in author- or institution-pays contributions;
? stress that the hybrid model, as currently defined and implemented by
publishers, is not a working and viable
pathway to Open Access. Any model for transition to Open Access supported
by Science Europe Member
Organisations must prevent ?double dipping? and increase cost transparency;
? recognise that some redirection and reorganisation of current budgets
will be necessary. Governments
should give due consideration to the fact that public funds for journal
subscriptions often come from other
ministries or institutions than those directly responsible for funding
research; consequently, some rebalancing
of budgets may be required.

Science Europe wishes to encourage the European Commission, national
governments, research
funding and research performing organisations and other stakeholders across
the world to adopt
this approach to Open Access and to actively nurture collaboration in this
area.

I agree that the Science Europe statement is mostly very good.

But ...

When did we get so habituated to publishers' entitlement that we now
CELEBRATE a six-month embargo as though it's a victory rather than an
outrage?

There is no justification for ANY embargo, ever. It's time we started
getting noisy about that fact.

I see your point Mike.

But in the context of the US OSTP policy, and many others allowing 12
months embargo, having another statement that says 6 months and NO MORE is
plenty enough - I'd say *in that context* it's pleasing.

Its going in the right direction towards: immediate open access (and
nothing less)

Agreed. It's better than what we might have expected, and that's
something we should celebrate and enjoy.

But let's keep thinking of six-month embargoes as what they are: a
step along the way to the only real acceptable destination of a
zero-embargo world.

-- Mike.

I agree . I'm a hardliner on this. It's our material - our research - we
created it without thought of personal financial reward.  6 months is
unacceptable.  The same happens with licences - every assumption that we
have to negotiate with publishers is an implicit concession. We have
absolute rights - we blundered many away but they are still rights and we
must fight for them.

Absolutely

> > Organisations share the view that:

> > ? Open Access to the published results of publicly-funded research will

> > potential users in industry, charitable and
> > public sectors, to individual professionals, and to the general public;
> > ? Open Access, as defined in the Berlin Declaration, is not only about
> the
> > right of access, but also about the
> > opportunity to re-use information with as few restrictions as possible,
> > subject to proper attribution;
> > ? the common goal of Science Europe Members is to shift to a research
> > publication system in which free

> > ? recognise repositories and related facilities as key strategic research
> > infrastructure which should comply with

> > ? stress that research publications should either be published in an Open
> > Access journal or be deposited as soon as possible in a repository, and
> made
> > available in Open Access in all cases no later than six months

Dear all,****

** **

     As a reminder, tomorrow is the closing date for registering to
participate in person or remotely in the National Academy of Sciences
meeting on the White House directive for all federally funded journal
articles to be made publicly accessible.
http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CurrentProjects/DBASSE_082378#.UYkwuUp48mN
****

** **

     Topics to consider commenting on are the appropriate embargo period
and what reuse rights users should have.  The agency plans have to enable
users to read, download and ?analyze? the publications.  I believe
?analyze? means analyze computationally, which means enabling bulk download
for text mining purposes.  If others agree, that would be a useful point to
convey.****

** **

    In addition, I?m going to argue that the agencies should permit
republication of publicly accessible manuscripts on other websites.  As a
fallback, I think at a minimum institutional repositories should have the
rights to mirror the publicly accessible versions of the articles.  Even if
your repository would not currently have interest in doing so, think of
this as an insurance policy in the case that funding for public access
repositories dries up in the future.  If mirroring rights are part of the
plan, then the community can work together to maintain public access.
Again, if you agree, that would be a useful point to make as well.****

** **

Best,****

Hi Victor,

I'm afraid I don't have a page explaining #FundFreeCulture, but basically
it's a Twitter hashtag for any free/libre/open projects that have a
commercial element. For example, if you can buy a book that is under
Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike, it would qualify - as would a
computer program under the GNU General Public License or the donation page
of an artist whose creations come under the Free Art License.

Does that answer your question?
Cheers,
Chris

Subject: [Open-access] Introducing OSTI: How does graduate training in open
	science work in practice?
Message-ID: <CAB2qYTKREj019xYMiLhB7uGcd2+8wGPdB91_4+ONoUOqGMTWwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Apologies in advance for any cross-posting!

Some of you may have been following the progress of my Panton Fellowship
work over the past year, the main focus of which was establishing a
graduate training scheme in open science, the *Open Science Training
Initiative (OSTI)*. There have been some exciting developments with the
course in recent weeks and we're really close to releasing the first full
set of course materials for others to use in their own teaching to train
young academics in open science and data-centric/digital research
methodologies, so I thought I'd update you all on progress. If you're
interested in hearing about how the course works in practice, then *scroll
down for a download link to the post-pilot report!*

*What is OSTI?*
The OSTI scheme is a teaching pattern and series of mini-lectures, designed
to transform existing subject-specific graduate courses in the sciences to
foster open working practices and scientific reproducibility. Its main
features include:

   - dynamic teaching model of Rotation Based Learning,
   - hands-on application of licensing, data management and data analysis
   techniques, building students knowledge of, and confidence in using, these
   approaches;
   - daily lectures and exercises in key subjects including "Content, Code
   & Data Licensing", "The Changing Face of Publication" and "Data Management
   Planning" accompany the main component of research time in the timetable,
   providing students with knowledge they can then consolidate through
   application to their research.


*Open Science Training in Practice - download the report now!*
After many months of hard work and analysis, the post-pilot report on OSTI
was released last Saturday and is now available for download from the OSTI
website, via http://www.opensciencetraining.com/content.php. The report
draws on a broad range of perspectives from the student cohort, the
auxiliary demonstrators and the course leader. A curated data set to
accompany the report will be appearing on the OSTI site very soon and
lecture movies from the pilot initiative have been appearing on the site
over the past week. Keep checking back over the coming weeks as more
content and downloads become available.

*Where can I get course materials?*
The official set of course materials will be appearing on our GitHub
repository <https://github.com/StilettoFiend/OpenScienceTraining> over the
coming weeks - these are currently being tweaked based on the feedback we
received and I can't wait for others to fork the project and create other
versions of the course as well.

Please feel free to get in touch with me if you'd like to hear more about
OSTI, or have any comments, questions or suggestions. If we're going to
encourage uptake of Open working practices in the sciences, we need to
start training our researchers in these approaches *now*. If you think
there's an opening at your institution for this kind of approach, then I
would love to hear from you!

Thanks for your attention - best wishes,

Sophie

Hi all,

I saw this circulated already in many Working group mailing lists, but if
you have not seen it yet: OKCon now accepts your proposals!

http://okcon.org/call-for-proposals/

Note that the organisational setup of OKCon is slightly different than last
years OKFestival (which is basically a different event). I hope to see many
of you talking about your great work in Geneva!

All the best,

Joris

p.s: The OKFestival with its more bottum up approach will return in 2014
and you are all very much invited to contribute to make this an even bigger
success than last years.

Strapline, "Hacking academia better together"
There's an interesting hack event being held in London on Saturday 6th July
you might want to attend:

The goals of the event are:


   - Demonstrate the value of the CC-BY licence within academia. We are
   interested in supporting innovations around and on top of the literature.
   - Reach out to academics who are keen to learn or improve their
   programming skills to better their research. We?re especially interested in
   academics who have never coded before.

Do note the 2nd point. You don't need to be a coder :)

The event is being run by Jason (from PeerJ) and Ian (from eLife), with
sponsorship from: PLOS, eLife, Amazon Web Services, PeerJ & Skills Matter
(in no particular order). Registration for the event (?1) is here:
http://hack4ac.eventbrite.co.uk/

I've signed down already.

Best,

Ross

Hi Liang,


This is really cool. Thanks for sharing it with us.

I'm copying your message across the to open-science and open-access mailing
lists because I think they might also be interested in this.

I'd like to see the Publisher details added, as well as DOI range (hard!).
There's a whole load of OA journals & their RSS feeds we could add from
DOAJ with a bit of data munging I think.

Very promising...

Ross

Hello,

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjfpjwzLd5bUdEY5MF9KUmROaW1WZklOYmoweEtZakE&usp=sharing
is a list of 14266 journals' feed from http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/
several years ago and they've stopped releasing it.

I think it will be very useful to have a crowdsourcing platform like
wikipedia for academic journals, so I imported this list into Drupal.
http://shenzhuxi.com/journals is a quick prototype and I'd like to
hear more suggestions.

wikijournal.org seems to be the best domain name but it's not available.

More fields like website url, impact factor (not sure about the
copyright), publication frequency, Open Access, RSS/ATOM and etc. will
be good to be added and maintained by the community.

Also It will be nice to dump all the journal feed items from Google
Reader (https://code.google.com/p/pyrfeed/wiki/GoogleReaderAPI) and
collect regularly in the future. Since Google Reader will be closed
soon, I talked about the historical data with JournalTOCs
https://twitter.com/JournalTOCs/status/312180502184476672, but they
don't have.

I'm afraid I don't, but maybe someone on these lists does?

Possibly.

I have a gist of 1176 CC BY licensed OA journals and their ISSN's here. No
RSS feeds for them though: https://gist.github.com/rossmounce/5083733

Have you thought about using Crowdcrafting to get people to add details,
rather than drupal?
e.g. something like this: http://crowdcrafting.org/app/oajournals/
It might be prettier...



> I just added OA or not field,

Cool. I hope you're using the BOAI definition of OA? A lot of journals
online are just 'free access' rather than explicitly open access I'm
afraid, and it's tricky to work out which is which. I suggest you change
that field to 'free access' (Y/N) to reduce complexity.

Agreed. It is CRUCIAL to get rid of NC, otherwise:
* the policy does not describe "open access" as originally defined
* materials released under the NC licence can't be used in Wikipedia
* neither can they be used in leading OA journals such as BMC, PLOS,
eLife and PeerJ

Heather Piwowar said it best: "we do research not just to KNOW more
but to DO more". In general, NC clauses prevent much of the doing even
when they allow the knowing.

Although in principle I see the value of the SA clause, it too is
problematic for practical reasons. Most importantly, it's not
acceptable downstream by pure CC By venues like BMC, PLOS, eLife and
PeerJ, because the SA bit is viral and infects whatever the material
is incorporated into.

The correct licence for open access is CC By. This conclusion has been
reach repeatedly by many excellent organisations that have looked into
it.

-- Mike.

Thank you Mike and Peter for the suggesting CC BY. We have used it for
MAPAI's OAJMAP <http://oajmap.in> which is hosted by ICAR itself on
its e-publication platform.

But as ICAR had just begun to think of formulating a policy and was
slowing in transforming itself into Open Access...

It had made its two journals Open Access but there was no Policy...

So, we thought 'NC' is good to start with and assure that it is
'Safe'. Otherwise, most of its publications are 'All Rights Reserved'.

We would surely suggest for CC -BY.

Thanks
Sridhar

That's the real danger. Once a change to some form of open has been
made, appetite for further change can easily dissipate, and then
you're left hamstrung by NC indefinitely.

I would argue that CC-BY has already been shown to be 'safe' by the many
large and successful publishers and institutions (inc the World Bank and
now UNESCO) that already use CC-BY or a similarly permissive license for
most/all their outputs. As far as I know, none of these organisations have
felt to the need to move back to a less permissive license, which suggests
their experience has not been negative. As Peter mentioned, switching
licenses at a later stage is non-trivial and to be avoided.

+1 also for Mike's point.

Jenny

Turn the argumentation around: So just start with CC-BY and argue that you just test it for one year, if it does not work CC-BY-NC can be an option later.

Always remember: CC-BY-NC is not "open"!

Christian

As far as I know, none of these organisations have felt to the need to move back to a less permissive license, which suggests their experience has not been negative. As Peter mentioned, switching licenses at a later stage is non-trivial and to be avoided.

Hi Ross,

If you're looking for a tool to aggregate a large number of journal RSS
feeds, especially in a way that supports social tagging, I can recommend
TagTeam, an open-source project I launched in 2011. Since the fall of 2012,
the Open Access Tracking Project has run on TagTeam. Here's my short
introduction to the software; I'd be happy to say more if you'd like.

it hits one of the addressee listservs. But for direct correspondence,
please use <peter.suber at gmail.com> or <psuber at cyber.law.harvard.edu>.

Dear Sridhar,

An excellent mandate proposal, especially your proposed modification:

The authors of the scholarly literature produced from the research 
funded by the ICAR at either ICAR establishments or elsewhere in 
the NARS are required to deposit final version of the author's 
peer-reviewed manuscript at the time of acceptance and no later 
than the time of publication in the ICAR institute?s Open Access 
Institutional Repositories or in any other appropriate Open Access 
repositories of NARS.

I've registered it for you as a proposed multi-institutional mandate in ROARMAP:

http://roarmap.eprints.org/839/

Bravo. Let us hope the modified proposal is adopted soon!

Best wishes,

Stevan Harnad

Excellent work, Sridhar.

I would strongly recommend, however, removal of reference to the CC-BY  
license. This is NOT in the best interests of Indian scholars or  
Indian research funders. This gives blanket commercial rights to  
anyone, anywhere downstream, with absolutely no obligation for  
reciprocity. That is, if CC-BY becomes the default, it is quite  
possible that a next generation of research tools will be built by the  
commercial sector on a for-pay basis with no obligation to provide  
affordable pricing for countries like India - who could easily end up  
one step ahead (getting the benefits of open access to the kinds of  
publications produced now), but two steps behind (locked out of access  
to the next generation tools).

This is section that I am referring to - I would suggest simply  
removing the whole section.

12. All the ICAR institute?s website content, print/digital  
publications, meta-data and full-texts in repositories are to be  
licensed for public use under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC- 
BY 3.0) Unported License

I acknowledge that many of my colleagues in the open access movement  
are strong proponents of CC-BY licensing, and that there are positive  
as well as negative implications of using this license. This is a  
topic that I have explored and continue to explore in some depth -  
links to some of my writings including my submission to the UK BIS  
committee can be found from here:

Dear Heather,

I was following your arguments against CC-BY and others for CC-BY.

I am in the CC-BY as its a non exclusive license and everyone would
have equal chances to use the content and make tools and applications.

Now in the larger interest I have included CC-BY in the policy draft
(modified) as proposed by the leaders of the OA movement.

Now this draft would be submitted to the committee headed formed for
formulating the guidelines for open access policy in ICAR.

23rd May is the last date for submission of the comments. See
http://www.icar.org.in/en/node/6056.

The Copyright policy of ICAR is as follows:

Thanks, Sridhar. For what it's worth, I endorse your far-sighted
preference for the CC BY licence over the more restrictive
alternatives. The NC clause certain can sing a siren song -- I've been
seduced by it myself in the past -- but informed voices are all but
unanimous that plain CC BY is best for the community as a whole, and
strongly support the proposition that it's usually best for the
individual author. (Heather is an eloquent, but isolated, dissenting
voice).

The adoption of CC BY by commercial OA publishers like BMC and PeerJ
as well as non-profits like PLOS and eLife and large international
organisation like the World Bank and UNESCO shows how generally it's
applicable, and demonstrates what a broad range of well-informed
organisations have reached this conclusion. ICAR would be a worth
addition to those ranks.

-- Mike.

Not sure if someone else answered this but technically speaking the idea of a DOI range doesn't really exist. Certain prefixes are granted to publishers but the DOIs are attached to papers, not publishers, thus if a journal moves publishers then the DOIs go with it. Similarly (although I don't think this has happened in practice) a publisher might get a new prefix.

On top of this there is no requirement for consistency of presentation for the DOI suffix, so the idea of a range which can be traversed by counting through is misleading. For instance BMC DOIs appear to made up of the BMC prefix (10.1186) the journal ISSN and the volume and "page number". You can't count through these. And of course BMC is owned by Springer so who is the "publisher" in this case?

At the end of the day the DOI prefix can tell you with some confidence which publisher minted the DOI associated with a given paper. CrossRef explicitly say that this can't be relied on - for some of the reasons given above - but I've not come across major problems assuming this.

Unfortunately the one thing you can't do, which is what would be useful, is to get a full list of DOIs for a given publisher. You can do it per journal if you query search.crossref.org with an ISSN

Cheers

Cameron

Dear all,

publishers owning DOI prefixes registered with CrossRef are listed at
http://www.crossref.org/06members/50go-live.html .

I am not aware of a similar listing for prefixes registered elsewhere.

Cheers,

Daniel

Adding to Cameron's post, this quote from the DOI site (http://www.doi.org ? in particular http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html item 2.2) may be relevant:

In use, the DOI name is an "opaque string" or "dumb number" ? nothing at all can or should be inferred from the number in respect of its use in the DOI system. The only secure way of knowing anything about the entity that a particular DOI name identifies is by looking at the metadata that the Registrant of the DOI name declares at the time of registration. This means, for example, that even when the ownership of a particular item changes, its identifier remains the same ? in perpetuity. This is why the DOI name is called a "persistent identifier".

We have done this for crystallographic papers (
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/summary/index.html ) where we have
trawled the exposed metadata (PubCrawler, NickDay/SamAdams, open source)
for publisher/journal/issue/article hierarchy using the publisher ToCs.
This couldn't be definitive (i.e. in a court) but it's good enough for most
people. As long as publishers provide  online ToCs then we can do this
fairly easily technically.

Crucial strategic distinctions:

Immediate-deposit should be required.

Immediate-OA to the immediate-deposit should be recommended,
not required.

CC licenses should be recommended, not required.

Reasons:

Immediate-deposit cannot be embargoed by publishers.

Immediate-OA can be embargoed by publishers.

Requiring CC licenses encourages publisher embargoes (against
immediate free-riding from rival publishers)

All fields, authors and users want and need online access

But not all fields, authors and users want and need the same CC
licenses

Immediate-deposit can be mandated globally, by institutions and funders.

Once immediate-deposit mandates prevail globally, all the rest of the
things all fields, authors and users  want and need will follow:

1. the death of embargoes, 
2. the end of subscriptions
3. publishers downsizing and converting to Gold OA 
4.  all the CC rights each field, author and user wants and needs

But not if we insist on 1-4 in advance.

Dixit.

Hey All,

I thought some you of might be interested in to hear about the open source
authoring tool we at Fidus Writer are working on. We are four people behind
Fidus Writer ( http://www.fiduswriter.com ) which is basically a Google
Docs for academics with citation management. We would like to enable
authors and editors to work with structured and complex content without
needing to know about technical details. If anything works as planed we
could have an open source 1.0 version this summer, which should be usable
for creating scientific papers and journals.

At the moment we try to gather as much feedback as possible and get in
contact with people that might be interested in this. So if you have any
questions or ideas don?t hesitate to drop us a line.



//Daniel

Join us in Montpellier for a one-day event to hack on scholarly PDFs!

Do you have tools that may help us to extract information from PDFs?
send us an email so that we can include them in the hackathon.

Would you like to extract citations from existing PDFs?

Wouldn't it be cool if we, scholars, did not have to pay for citation
data? What about author disambiguation?

Are you interested in identifying and extracting meaningful parts from PDFs?

Would you like to have XML/RDF for scholarly PDFs? What if you could
have access to the actual content of the PDF for supporting the Web of
Data?

We are interested in all of these issues, send us your tools, ideas,
comments and join us in Montpellier. We are also supporting remote
participation to the hackathon -hangout and webex.

Subject: [Open-access] BMJHackday
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEy3by31a=z5COXg0SLARAtw8hvNcjUqKV_yT-YYWQRw-g@mail.gmail.com>

Rewired State & BMJ (British Medical Journal) have teamed up to do a
hackday in London 6 Jul - 7 Jul 2013

registration here: http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/bmj

The theme is: ?Access to the best knowledge is the key to delivering
quality healthcare?

Topic 4 may be of particular interest to these lists:  *Revolutionise the
scholarly publishing process*

The classical scholarly publishing model has not changed radically since
the nineteenth century. A key criticism is the requirement to reduce years
worth of research into a restrictive, text-based end product; the article
of record.

* How could we capture more of the research process and enable
collaboration before and after publication?

* In the future, scientific output could be measured using all types of
data, from spreadsheets of observations to algorithms and analysis tools.
How can we bring all of this information together to create a meaningful
product? What should an article look like to achieve maximum effectiveness?

* Leading the clinical open data challenge is the BMJ which requires all
research papers, especially those involving clinical trials, to deposit the
underlying clinical and research data in an open repository, but it is
often not usable by those most interested in it. What are the giant steps
forward that could enable the reuse of that data? For example, the Reinhart
and Rogoff economists' spreadsheet that was found wanting when a student
got access to their actual data.

* Storage of data needs to come with easy (open) tools that can enable
multiple fact checks.

* The peer-to-peer networking and public-key cryptography of Bitcoin is an
example of a zero barrier route to validating data.


But there are also bits on crowd-sourcing that may be of interest. Take a
look!

Hello,

The domain name journaltank.org is in use now.

Feed items can be viewed now. http://journaltank.org/journal/nature

Is it better to allow users edit journals without register like Wikipedia?

If you mean PubCrawler it's a per-publisher template/heuristic. Because
publishers use the same template over many journals it's worthwhile to work
out templates. I don't think you could use machine-learning very easily.
Some publishers are very difficult as they have javascript popups etc. many
publisher site are full of advertising junk and it's hard for a human to
find the table of contents.

Likely true for many other scientific disciplines.

 Original article: Troubling Trends in Scientific Software Use
 Science 17 May 2013: 883
 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/814

http://phys.org/news/2013-05-ecologists-overreliance-unvetted-source-code.html

"(Phys.org) ?A team of scientists, led by ecologist Lucas Joppa of
Microsoft Research, has published a commentary piece in the journal
Science, highlighting what they say is a growing problem in research
efforts. They suggest that an overreliance on source code that has not
been properly vetted is increasingly leading to incorrect research
effort results.

The problem, Joppa et al, say, is that increasingly, researchers are
relying on existing software to perform their research, despite the
fact that no one has peer reviewed the software itself. It's a
problem, they say, that is particularly troubling when big
applications are used because small coding errors can be compounded. A
rounding error in a spreadsheet generally won't cause much problem,
they note, but when a rounding error is repeated over and over again,
perhaps millions of times, it can lead to completely inaccurate
results."

Hi Peter,

Is it based on templates or certain smart algorithm which can be used
on most journal websites?

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEx8id0q_-0r6COr3QAgULO-=KiqRm+rWtva90LWTiv6jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I got invited to write a blog post on simple, practical steps towards open
scholarship:
http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/05/24/easy-steps-towards-open-scholarship/

It isn't my usual style, it's a softer approach - I don't once mention
licencing issues (even though I know this is key if we want truly *open*
research). But hopefully it'll reach a different kind of audience hitherto
less impressed by the benefits of openness.

...with a combination of preprint & postprint postings, it's easy to make
your research freely available
Upload your work today!

Message-ID: <98A1BEE3-FC84-42D3-A946-28660E8136F9@cameronneylon.net>

Dear All

Just a note that the PLOS/Google/Wellcome Accelerating Science Awards Program is about halfway through the nomination period. The program will award three prizes of $30,000 to people or groups who have made imaginative, novel, or exciting use of open access research (literature or data). in particular the awards will focus on those who have demonstrated, through their use the potential of Open Access content.

I'm sure you are all aware of examples of educators, policy makers, patient advocates, entrepreneurs, and even researchers doing exciting things. Please do nominate people, encourage others to nominate, or to nominate themselves at asap.plos.org prior to June 15. We want to collect the most interesting, exciting and informative global stories of the use of OA content and data.

Cheers

Cameron

Dear all,

As you might have seen, there are quite some surge in the community to do a
satellite event at the OKCon, very possibly Sept 19.

In order to know how many would join (logistics...), please fill in the
following poll before Monday June 3: http://www.doodle.com/6rnrcp872g4uwse4

Thanks much in advance :)

Hi All

If you know of any students in the UK who might have a great idea on the
theme of open research, open educational resources or similar, JISC are
offering ?5k grants for student teams to develop technology to improve
student teaching and research.

Subject: [Open-access] OKCon13 Open/Citizen Science Satellite event: Summary
 of our first call & Doodle
Message-ID: <CANACerFCDZ9S9WzR=S0Po8WnPYrAxm=+7jWztzEqNX8PqrVLng@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Please find below the short summary of the questions we discussed today.
Thanks everyone who attended and provided insights!

Our second call will take place in around two weeks from now, if you wanna
join, please select a date: http://doodle.com/ghaagbppet256gst

Thanks,
Rayna

*---- Notes 29/05/2012 ----*
*Joris's feedback on 2012 event*
* this year's event is different from OKFest
* tickets are more expensive than OKFest 2012, so audience will be different
* feedback from OKFest2012 Science event:
http://science.okfn.org/2012/09/19/okfest-open-science-and-culture-hackday-project-2-louhos/
The hack event with a clear plan from the start was most productive
Last year, few devs/techies but otherwise very productive

*Details on this year's event*
* OpenGLAM has a satellite event on Monday, they've booked a room for 30
ppl -> get in touch with Beatrice (the main organizer)
* Main OKCon venue is an official conference venue, pretty strict rules.
Perhaps consider another opportunity.

*Discussions on the satellite event:*
Problems/opportunities for one-day event:
Experience from culture hacks: Joris: leave people on their own => not much
happens
* mixed audience in the same room -> possibly a fail
* contribute small actions on existing projects works fine
* take into account the competences of the different people
* plan things for non-techies (the projects should implement this too)
* pay attention to pre-defined teams and topics, can be a bit restrictive
* work interdisciplinary by finding a right balance between competences
given aims of the activity
* ask the different idea/topic-propellers to define the basic competences
they'll need to get their stuff running good idea!
Naming "hack day" implies coding, maybe consider other name?
communicate that deliverables are good to the projects. Deliverables can be:
- presentation 5min at end of day? << yes
- write short summary to a blog post for OKFN? << yes!
- share mind-map or other things produced during the day? << why not, but
this is a very specific thing and generally leaves everyone puzzled cuz it
reflects one's vision and links ;)

Submit proposal for satelite event before Friday 31st:
http://okcon.org/call-for-proposals/

idea: set limit on number of topics/pitches/projects to work on
e.g. if we can accommodate 30 participants, let's set a limit to 6-8 topics

*Next call:* in two weeks from now (around 10-14 June), we send a Doodle.
