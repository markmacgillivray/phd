Happy new year!

To start out 2014, I investigate the following question on my blog:

Is it feasible to create a self-regulating market for Open Access (OA)
journals where competition for money is aligned with the quest for
scholarly excellence?

I hope the answer satisfies European collectivists and Rand-inspired
capitalists alike...

Useful ideas.

The main problem is the *Universities* who have shown themselves to be
completely uninterested in any new ideas in scholarly publishing. Your
proposal - like many others - requires some collective action by
universities. But they currently outsource their thinking to commercial
organisations (Google, TR, Scopus, Mendeley, etc.).

Message-ID: <CABOTVX91gg1Bhh98yw3Y=FRU1E+1cxwhzvAkpH2b6eGWTyeH6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone from the OKF community was planning to attend the
RECODE workshop in Geneva on 14 Jan:
http://recodeproject.eu/events/recode-workshops/. It's called 'Perspectives
in understanding open access to research data ? infrastructure and
technology challenges'

I'd loved to have gone - but sadly I'm already busy that day.

If anyone is going, I'd love it if you could let me know was gets said -
either as an email to the open-science and open-access lists, or possibly a
blog somewhere?

Best wishes,
Michelle

Dear All

I've been involved in a NISO working group looking at standards for expressing licensing and readership rights in published literature. We have generated a set of recommendations for metadata to be transmitted with articles and/or made available in appropriate repositories. The recommendations are now available for a comment: 

OAMI public workroom page (http://www.niso.org/workrooms/oami/) 
 
Public landing page for the draft and online comments form - http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/document.php?document_id=12047

The recommendations are actually very minimal in form but they represent an agreed view from a very wide range of stakeholders which is valuable. Their adoption could significantly reduce the confusion around re-use rights and reading rights. You will notice that there is a complete avoidance of the term "open access" in the metadata elements. This is quite deliberate as a means of avoiding disagreements over what "counts" as open access while focussing on making information that is hopefully reasonably objective available. 

There are also things we decided not to tackle, including the actual location of copies (this is covered by existing Crossref elements and may in fact be undefined if the metadata is being transmitted with a copy) and visual identifiers. The fact that we didn't include that in this doesn't of course mean that others couldn't expand this set of elements by local agreement for their own purposes.

Cheers

Cameron

This looks pretty good, and I particularly endorse not using the term
"open access" in light of the confusion that has been engineered
surrounding that term.

But it seems terribly weak not to encode the specific bits of the CC
licences, which are nearly always what people want to express and
search for, even when an actual CC licence is not used. This
specification really needs elements like

<attribution_required/>
<non_commercial/>
<no_derivatives/>
<share_alike/>

To make it useful.

I was also hoping for something more tailored towards CC licenses,
which would make it easier to implement such a system on Wikipedia, as
sketched out at
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Access/Signalling_OA-ness
.

We went around the loop on this a lot. 

The reason for not doing this is two-fold. 

The first was that any such element could easily be inconsistent with the actual license. So if the license_ref link is to CC BY but someone encodes non-derivative in metadata which do you believe? And inconsistency is already a problem as Daniel repeatedly tweaks us about (with good cause!). So avoiding the risk of adding to that is important.

I also think encoding those legal terms in metadata is unhelpful. At the end of the day, the user is going to maintain a white-list of licenses that they know allow them to do what they want to do. On the small scale, you and I will look at say "Is it CC BY, OGL, ccZero? If so good". On a large scale people are going to have check with internal legal support - and legal won't care about metadata elements, they'll want to check each license. In an early draft there was a list of possible "rights" that included things like photocopying, emailing, extracting, using images...the list of specific rights/restrictions rapidly got so complicated as to be unworkable. And while there may in our community be agreement that NC/ND/SA are the important restrictions thats not necessarily the case more widely. 

The way we did suggest to deal with it in follow on work is a set of best practice recommendations that licenses for scholarly work should handle a specific set of issues - that is there are a set of standard-ish rights that all licenses should deal with. Then in the longer term we could build a registry that would map licenses to standardised rights sets. But this is a huge job because it requires all stakeholders agreeing on what "commercial" use means and what a "derivative" is. 

The other reason something like this wouldn't fly was the purely political one. Some organisations don't like CC licenses and anything that looks like "privileging" them was never going to work. My feeling was that in the end people will use work with CC licenses and simply won't use work with non-standard licenses because its too hard to figure out. 

The basic point was to find something that could both be agreed and be useful. I'm certainly not saying it solves all the problems and it doesn't simplify some things as much as it might but its a step forward - and just as importantly it isn't a step back, which it could have been.

Cheers

Cameron

I support the need for brief CC metadata. Has anyone from CC been involved?
Else I can take it back to CC to get some simple recommendations (I am on
the Science Advisory Board).

I acknowledge this point. However ...

Without this, the specification is essentially useless. It's not
machine-readable metadata in any but the thinnest, most legalistic
sense. The specification boils down to "here's a URL to a licence
text, get your lawyer to download it and look it over". I can't do
anything with that.

Then in the longer term we could build a registry that would map licenses to standardised rights sets. But this is a huge job because it requires all stakeholders agreeing on what "commercial" use means and what a "derivative" is.

Yes. A huge job that will either never happen, or be ready to use in
ten years, by which point this specification will have been left in
the dust by whatever pragmatic solutions wins out when the standard
turns out not to meet the actual need.

My feeling was that in the end people will use work with CC licenses and simply won't use work with non-standard licenses because its too hard to figure out.

This is the problem with standards organisations, of course. It's why
nearly all the truly useful standards are ones invented by a single
organisation that's out to actually get something done, and only
subsequently adopted by a standards body.

Really? "Not a step back" is the level of our aspirations now?

No I disagree. I accept its less useful for non-standard and proprietary licenses but having gone over this I don't think it is either legally, or possibly even theoretically, possible to build a general machine readable standard for rights - and the core problem is that those non-standard licences are just less useful anyway, because they're non-standard. In practice the way to do this, as you say is for a single organisation to create a widely used standard that everyone understands. CC have done that - the URL to a CC license is as good as machine readable. And to the extent it isn't then there's CC-REL.

And that specification will be CC licenses. For which the recommendation will support better standardised transmission and the adoption by Crossref means we've got a centralised place for collecting those license statements. The place to standardise is the licenses themselves, not the transmission mechanism. I'm more or less convinced that nothing else can work - but am happy to hear arguments to the contrary.

> Really? "Not a step back" is the level of our aspirations now?

When the risk was allowing certain parties to say "But NISO says that 'free-to-read' means Open Access so how can you argue with that?". Yep, and avoiding that alone was worth the six months that I sunk into it. That we got agreement from a diverse set of stakeholders that they should a) put their licenses at a defined place on the web and b) provide the URL to those terms with core metadata was a bonus. That we've separated metadata elements on reading rights from re-use rights is also good.

You have to defend the flanks as well as lead the advance.

The thing that could save this would be a registry of licence URLs, so
that a CC By document ALWAYS uses (say)
        http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/
(even though that resolves to a "not found page") rather than
        https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/
        http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/
        http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/
        http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
        http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode
Or any of the other many other credible candidate URLs

Software needs to be able to do something very simple:
        if (!strcmp(licenceURL, "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/") ...
otherwise people are surely going to implement swathes of error-prone
and mutually incompatible heuristics.

Such a registry of licenses (with provisions for versioning) would
also be useful to prevent non-standard licenses from being changed
over night.

I'm only following this on the periphery at the moment, so forgive me if I
misstep a bit here. But I don't see why there is a theoretical problem to
machine readable standard for rights - create a model for the rights that
you wish to be able to check for, then the licenses can be expressed in
those terms.

Legally however, yes, I can see a potential minefield in who is asserting
what rights a particular license provides. If I use an object because I've
machine-read a right that isn't actually provided by the license, what does
that mean? Who is responsible? Although that is potentially just as true
for a URL.

That said, there is no reason why you can't create a local (or even public)
registry of known license URLs, and create an actionable description of the
rights that you care about. You only ever need to encounter a license URL
once in order to add it to the registry, and after that, you can rely on
the fact that you have a registry of the rights that you care about.

Sorry you're right. Rhetorical over-reach. The "theoretical" issue is that metadata is an assertion, whereas licensing is an offer of terms for acceptance. My sense having gone over this is that the two are effectively incompatible or at least not equivalent in their underlying logic of responsibilities and guarantees. When you use a license you are bound by an agreement. When you use metadata there is no such binding. The set of responsibilities and who holds them are different. That said, I have not done a rigorous philosophical analysis, just a proof by exhaustion :-) 

You can agree a subset of rights that are expressed through metadata, but then the metadata elements must in effect refer to defined underlying legal language, which means that they are effectively a license, just one expressed in a way which isn't obvious. And you still have to agree that subset of rights and what they mean...which is as we've said not really feasible.

In terms of a registry - I realise where Mike was coming from now. You're absolutely right that a whitelist of defined URLs would be better but this wasn't politically tractable. What was tractable was a requirement that the URL resolve, and that the publisher agree they are bound by the terms at that URL (ie the URL must resolve to an actual license). My assumption is that those requirements make it clear that in those cases where a CC license is used you would choose to point at the CC URL. I guess in principle someone could put a copy of a CC license on their own server but why would you bother? 

What we can do is two-fold. Firstly work on best practice guidelines for linking to licenses and license expression to drive consistency (part of my work for this year) and secondly use existing registries eg the OKFN license server to build up that list of URLs in the wild and some subset of rights that matter to us. But my acceptance that this sits outside the recommendation was driven in large part by the same issue as Mike's concerns. A standards process will get bogged down whereas our community can just get on and build those tools up which will in the end be used by default. 

Cheers

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

January 9, 2014

Read it online: http://bit.ly/1ghYi3Q


GET READY to Submit Your OR2014 Proposal

A message from the Open Repositories 2014 Conference organizers

As the year turns it's time to look forward to the Ninth International
Conference on Open Repositories, OR2014 (#or2014). The conference will
take place June 9-13 in Helsinki, Finland hosted by University of
Helsinki?s twin libraries: Helsinki University Library and the
National Library of Finland.

The theme this year is "Towards Repository Ecosystems" emphasizing the
interconnected nature of repositories, institutions, technologies,
data and the people who make it all work together. There are several
different formats (see below) provided to encourage your participation
in this year's conference. With the deadline for submissions fast
approaching the organizers invite you to review the call for proposals
here:http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=281, and to submit your
proposal here:https://www.conftool.com/or2014/ by Feb. 3, 2014.

KEY DATES

? 3 February 2014: Deadline for submissions
? 4 April 2014: Submitters notified of acceptance to general conference
? 17 April 2014: Submitters notified of acceptance to interest groups
? 9-13 June 2014: OR2014 conference

SUBMISSION PROCESS

Conference Papers and Panels

We welcome proposals that are at least two pages and no more than four
pages in length for presentations or panels that deal with digital
repositories and repository services. Abstracts of accepted papers
will be made available through the conference?s web site, and later
they and associated materials will be made available in a repository
intended for current and future OR content. In general, sessions are
an hour and a half long with three papers per session; panels may take
an entire session. Relevant papers unsuccessful in the main track will
automatically be considered for inclusion, as appropriate, as an
Interest Group presentation.

Interest Group Presentations

One to two-page proposals for presentations or panels that focus on
use of one of the major repository platforms (DSpace, ePrints, Fedora
and Invenio) are invited from developers, researchers, repository
managers, administrators and practitioners describing novel
experiences or developments in the construction and use of
repositories involving issues specific to these technical platforms.

24x7 Presentation Proposals

We welcome one- to two-page proposals for 7 minute presentations
comprising no more than 24 slides. Similar to Pecha Kuchas or
Lightning Talks, these 24x7 presentations will be grouped into blocks
based on conference themes, with each block followed by a moderated
discussion / question and answer session involving the audience and
whole block of presenters. This format will provide conference goers
with a fast-paced survey of like work across many institutions, and
presenters the chance to disseminate their work in more depth and
context than a traditional poster.

"Repository Rants" 24x7 Block

One block of 24x7's at OR14 will revolve around "repository rants":
brief expos?s that challenge the conventional wisdom or practice, and
highlight what the repository community is doing that is misguided, or
perhaps just missing altogether. The top proposals will be
incorporated into a track meant to provoke unconventional approaches
to repository services.

Posters, Demos and Developer "How-To's"

We invite developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators
and practitioners to submit one-page proposals for posters,
demonstrations, technical how-tos and technology briefings. Posters
provide an opportunity to present work that isn?t appropriate for a
paper; you?ll have the chance to do a 60-second pitch for your poster
or demo during a plenary session at the conference. Developer
"How-To's" will provide a forum for running a mini-tutorial or
demonstration in the developer lounge, if there are enough interested
parties.

Developer Challenge

Each year a significant proportion of the delegates at Open
Repositories are software developers who work on repository software
or related services, and once again OR2014 will feature a Developer
Challenge. An announcement will be made in the future with more
details on the Challenge. Developers are also encouraged to make
submissions to the other tracks--including posters, demonstrations,
and 24x7 presentations--to present on recently completed work and
works-in-progress.

Workshops and Tutorials

One- to two-page proposals for Workshops and Tutorials addressing
theoretical or practical issues around digital repositories are
welcomed. Please address the following in your proposal:

? The subject of the event and what knowledge you intend to convey
? Length of session (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour? half a day? whole day?)
? How many attendees you plan to accommodate
? Technology and facility requirements
? Any other supplies or support required
? A brief statement on the learning outcomes from the session
? Anything else you believe is pertinent to carrying out the session

Submit your paper, poster, demo or workshop proposal through the
conference system. PDF format is preferred. Please include
presentation title, authors? names and affiliations in the submission.
The conference system is now open and  is linked from the conference
web site: http://or2014.helsinki.fi/

See you in Helsinki!

 Jan 21, 15:00 CET
Message-ID: <52D1215D.9070706@informatik.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear all,

On January 21st at 15:00 we are organizing a hangout introducing
SlideWiki.org:

https://plus.google.com/events/cd6gqh3qk66i0636crtofivka6c

SlideWiki.org is a platform for OpenCourseWare authoring and publishing.
Similar as Wikipedia allows the collaborative authoring of encyclopedic
texts, GitHub of sourceode or OpenStreetMaps of maps, SlideWiki enables
communities to create comprehensive open educational resources.
SlideWiki is open-source software and all content in SlideWiki is Open
Knowledge. In this hangout we want to introduce SlideWiki's rich feature
set and explain how SlideWiki can be used for educational projects and
teaching.

We aim to make SlideWiki an official OKF Germany project and would also
be excited to see other OKF projects (such as School of Data and/or the
various handbooks on open data, journalism etc.) using SlideWiki for
OpenCourseWare.

Would be great if you joined the hangout. Meanwhile feel free to play
with SlideWiki (http://SlideWiki.org) and to look at the documentation
(http://slidewiki.org/documentation/).

On behalf of the SlideWiki team,

S?ren

Dear lists,

perhaps this might be of interest: Yesterday an anthology on Open 
Science was published: "Opening Science - The Evolving Guide on How the 
Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing". 
It has been edited by S?nke Bartling from the German Cancer Research 
Center in Heidelberg and  Sascha Friesike, researcher at the Alexander 
von Humboldt Institute in Berlin. The anthology knows four 
manifestations: it is available as a printed book,  as an Open Access 
e-Book or PDF collection under a CC BY-NC license, and as an editable 
living document via Github. for further information please visit:

Sounds useful.

One comment. CC-NC is not Open Access under BOAI- and OKD- definitions. I'd
urge you to make the book CC-BY. If there are reasons that you can't do
this, please drop the term "Open Access" and call it "free-of-charge".
CC-NC forbids many forms of redistribution and re-use

Sorry for hacking the topic, but I've always wondered why CC-BY became 
the standard of Open Access and not CC-BY-SA. This license is not viral: 
it allows the republication under any kind of intellectual protection 
(including copyright) and, therefore, the re-establishment of 
enclosures. That's not really the kind of disposition that would ensure 
an healthy open access ecosystem, especially considering the current 
open washing frenzy. CC-BY is a real blessing for scientific social 
network, that are prone to enclose a once-free content in order to drain 
personal data. Even the public domain greets more protection, as 
copyfraud tends to be more and more discredited.

I might sound heterodox, but, by this concern, I even prefer CC-NC to 
CC-BY? At least, the license includes some kind of virality, even if NC 
remains a much poorer protection than SA.

Discrimination based on field of endeavour I thought was the problem.

Even if some copyright exceptions allow use in situations in which the
license didn't *intend* to allow such use, the license still discriminates
based on the type of activity ("field of endeavour") - doesn't allow
commercial use.

The legal ability to use something for commercial reasons and being told
not to by the license are two separate things, though obviously related.
Being told not to by the license makes it a non-open license according to
OKD.

This isn't to say non-commercial licenses are evil in all situations, I
can't pass that judgement. But if you use a non-commercial clause, you
certainly can't call the thing "open access" - it's accessible to some part
of the population, but it is not "open". Like this anthology (which by the
way looks like it's quite nice).

Greetings,
Emanuil

Because as long as the/your original source is online with CC-BY you don?t care about further use; you just mention that you would like/prefer (unless you have very strong lawyers, which you probably don?t) to be cited. By making something viral or making it NC you prevent a huge potential group of users to just consider your resource for use. Remember that such users may be under other constraints than us guys, data-liberals, and be forced by their institutions, company etc. to just have other licensing schemes (the usual example concerning NC of a University (UK ;-)) selling courses at high prices to foreign students).
If you want others to be CC-BY aficionados, just evangelize, don?t coerce.
Hope you have a sunny Sunday. It?s grey here in Berlin,
Laurent

There are different perspectives in whether open access must include blanket pre-approval of commercial re-use rights downstream. Of the fully open access journals listed in DOAJ, for example, many do not use CC licenses at all and many that do use NC. Scholars who do use CC-BY licenses sometimes complain when they see people selling their work downstream. I argue for a broader understanding of open access modelled after Suber's short definition, along the lines of "open access works are digital, online, free of charge to the reader and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions". It is premature and a distraction to focus on particular licenses or licensing elements. Meaningful technical manipulation and re-use is best pursued thorough technical approaches, such as best  practices for formats and consistent metadata. What has made the development and rapid spread of transit applications is a consistent standard for common standard-related information such as bus number, bus stop, scheduling. If every city follows a pattern and releases the data openly then apps can develop and spread quickly. A focus on licensing would not achieve this effect.

Analysis of this example may be useful to highlight why more thought is needed on the question of licensing. Many would agree (including me, for this example), that prohibiting commercial use would stifle development and be largely counter-productive. On the other hand, with no restrictions on re-use, one future possibility is a scenario where everyone has to pay for transit information that is now free. That is, if people use commercial apps and not government services, governments may not continue to develop public services. This may be just fine if the commercial sector provides awesome service, for free, on an ongoing basis. However, one of the potential pitfalls of open licensing we should be paying more attention to is that "no downstream restrictions" includes "no downstream restrictions on paywalls".

In summary, the view that open access can be usefully narrowly defined through legal terms is the view of a subset of the open access community.

Best,

Discrimination based on field of endeavour I thought was the problem.

Even if some copyright exceptions allow use in situations in which the license didn't *intend* to allow such use, the license still discriminates based on the type of activity ("field of endeavour") - doesn't allow commercial use.

The legal ability to use something for commercial reasons and being told not to by the license are two separate things, though obviously related. Being told not to by the license makes it a non-open license according to OKD.

This isn't to say non-commercial licenses are evil in all situations, I can't pass that judgement. But if you use a non-commercial clause, you certainly can't call the thing "open access" - it's accessible to some part of the population, but it is not "open". Like this anthology (which by the way looks like it's quite nice).

One comment. CC-NC is not Open Access under BOAI- and OKD- definitions. I'd urge you to make the book CC-BY. If there are reasons that you can't do this, please drop the term "Open Access" and call it "free-of-charge". CC-NC forbids many forms of redistribution and re-use

That's technically true. But that subset includes (among many, many
others) BioMed Central, the Public Library of Science, Hindawi, eLIFE
and PeerJ. In other words, all the major players in the open-access
publishing world.

Heather's view that NC clauses can be useful lingers on in dark
corners, but no-one should be fooled that a preference for NC is
mainstream anywhere outside of the legacy barrier-based publishers
that are being dragged reluctantly into the open-access light and
fighting every aspect of openness along the way our of sheer habit and
bloody-mindedness.

To be clear, I am not arguing for the benefits of NC licenses, rather against the perspective that CC-BY should be a default for open access, enforced through coercion of open access publishers and as a part of open access policy. I see dangers to open access itself through CC-BY, in addition to these arguments that this focus on licensing ignores steps which would be much more effective in achieving the kind of re-use many CC-BY advocates argue for (attending to formats and metadata standards, for example).  

My work to date on the mapping of open access and creative commons licenses is linked to from this post:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2012/10/critique-of-cc-by-series.html

In brief, while CC is an important initiative and the licenses are very useful, open access and CC licenses simply do not map. An entry point into this argument that all proponents of CC-BY as default should pay attention to: there is nothing in any of the CC licenses that obligates either licensor or licensee to make materials free of charge. It is true that you cannot add DRM to a work downstream to enforce downstream property rights, but you can put up a paywall before the person gets to the work. 

If OA advocates do not wish to see their works up for sale under RightsLink or other toll access venues that may be developed in the future, it is wise to take into account that CC-BY pre-authorizes this kind of use.

best,

Heather Morrison

I don't think it does. From the CC-BY licence:
"No additional restrictions ? You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits."
A paywall that everybody can just walk around is no more than an invitation to make a payment, a donation. Which a potential user can ignore. 
NC is a control mechanism. It has no place in a knowledge environment that is publicly funded for the benefit of society at large.

Somebody charging for access to a freely available unrestricted product is
not charging for that product, nor even for access to that product - they
are charging for the convenience of not having to bother finding the freely
available unrestricted version yourself. If you want that convenience more
than you value open access, then add restrictions.

If you value open access more, then don't add restrictions. That way, we
can balance provision of a convenient service with the value of open access
- because the provided service will not be valuable if it does not provide
the values the consumer desires.

If the provided services do not provide the desired value, and if the
products themselves are unrestricted, then service provision competitors
will be free to offer an alternative that does provide the values desired
by the consumer. If the products themselves are restricted, then this is
impossible.

Scarcity drives prices up. That is the reason to manufacture scarcity into
a product.

Is the purpose of scholarly production to increase profit, or to
disseminate scholarship? License accordingly.

Hi,

If so, I do not quite understand the difference between CC-BY and 
CC-BY-SA. The "no additional restrictions" clause sounds quite similar 
to "share alike": forbidding republication under stricter terms is, so 
far, equivalent to keeping the same license.

I'm quite convinced that NC is a problematic license, that prevents a 
lot of fair and positive uses. Selling the content is  clearly not a 
problem, if only to be able to cover the expenses of diffusion beyond 
the web (printed books, USB keys and so forth).

Yet, avoiding a viral mechanism creates, imho, more problems than it 
solves. It deprives the open access community of a strong incentive: if 
you want to use it, you have to left it open. This is an efficient way, 
yet not coercitive to encourage institutions to become less 
copyright-centered.

Besides the paradox developed by Heather meets one of my main concerns: 
open access publication could be enclosed once more thanks to the use of 
a non-viral license and a general reliance to commercial service. 
Wikipedia has globally avoided this worrying issue. While the commercial 
use of the encyclopedia is allowed it has not entailed any kind of 
extensive exploitation, thanks to the SA clause. Commercial services 
cannot profit from something that can be reproduced for free. They have 
to recreate an artificial paywall to perpetuate the value.

To clarify, my concern was not whether the book should be licensed CC-NC
but that if so it should not be called "open access". The word "Open" is
defined by the Open Definition of the Open Knowledge Foundation whose list
you are reading - on http://opendefinition.org/

?A piece of data or content is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and
redistribute it ? subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute
and/or share-alike.?

This definition is widely accepted in many disciplines such as Open-
software, hardware, data. Using "Open Access" to convey a more restricted
meaning does the world a disservice as it makes it almost impossible to
determine, without considerable research, what the person is talking about.
Since misinterpretation could land someone in court it matters.

When Heather Morrison says "fully open access" she includes CC-NC which
goes against the primary technical meaning of the word as expressed by OKD.
The situation is worse in that there are many seriously different sub
interpretations of "open access" that mean that discourse is impossible
even within the "OA" community, let alon between it and the rest of the
world.

Simply: When I say my code is "Open Source" the whole world understands
what I mean. When Heather says "fully open access" nobody by default
understands what she means.

***
On the point of CC-BY not protecting against monopolistic control. CC-BY
allows anyone to make a copy so that a monopolist cannot stop other
channels of distribution. They can create a market that is so universal
(for whatever reason) that everyone buys the product. The only real danger
is that noone preserves and advertises the free copies.

A real example. We are using an Open Source program from source code. It
needs compiling - that's work (and the program itself is hideously written
and difficult to compile). The authors also offer a precompiled binary for
a small fee. There's an attraction to using the binary. But I am still free
to distribute the source code to everyone in the world and I'm also free to
charge for it (I could even rewrite the code and make it better). But I
could not claim to be the sole author. That's how Open Source works

I guess what it boils down to (for me) is that what matters is how people
perceive CC-BY. If they think it "makes my article free to read (and to
text mine) [and open access]", then that's what will happen - eventually -
regardless of how somebody else interprets the license to suit a perhaps
ageing business model. They'll just think RightsLink is plain wrong to do
what they do.

It is of no significance that RightsLink can use the OA articles to profit,
as the resulting ill will will force the creation of more ... accurate
alternatives.

Say a medical start-up mines all of the medical papers they can get their
hands on in order to obtain information that aids new research, and then
sells that information back to medical departments? I'm sure opinion will
be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and
convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience
or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of
business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best
sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to
support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is
important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.
However, it's my understanding that CC-BY-NC would prevent this kind of
scenario. And as I said, not all scholars would be against this kind of
scenario. But they aren't going to think about it when picking CC-BY-NC
because "I don't want RightsLink to sell my article".

Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go
- we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to
exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual
mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful
every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all
research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like
those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as
the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most
scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)

There's an entirely separate issue that's usually conflated with the
published work itself - the metadata about the work. Where is it located,
what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that
info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally
this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the
originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though
the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)

Again, even if we somehow created this data from scratch (scraping and so
on), then how would we publish it? CC-BY - no problems for downstream
applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an
attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much.
If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could
they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of
CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?
DOAJ kind of illustrates this in fact, since their data is under CC-BY-SA,
which means that if I were to combine their dataset with other data, I'd
have to release the result under CC-BY-SA, which may hurt MY downstream
data consumers in ways I can't imagine.

So yes, CC-BY comes with no strings attached for downstream usage because
that hurts the flow of information and makes people deal with unintended
(sometimes to the point of being silly) scenarios when they should be
focussing on running their business or otherwise enhancing society.

Additionally, attaching restrictions to data use is practically useless
unless you can back your copyright infringement claims up. People serious
about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their
experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't
look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain
the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not.
People just take what they need when it's published, and we should
recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in
some cases even -SA).

The reason we can't go and download all the papers from publishers'
websites like Aaron Swartz did is not because their incredible restrictive
website ToS says so, it's because they have enough cash to back up their
ToS. And maybe (depending on personal values) because whoever does this
would be concerned they'd hurt real people (they do work at publishing
companies ..).

So attaching restrictions on downstream use just:
1. kills little innovative side projects people think up, because they
actually paid attention to the licensing and it forbade them from using the
data, and they were afraid enough of copyright law / potential bad
reputation not to go ahead
2. kills big serious innovative projects like companies, because older more
established ones use the restrictions they put on downstream usage of their
data against them

#2 is sometimes acceptable, we can't tell businesses not to compete or give
all their data away! But I'll certainly think more of a business which
publishes at least some good useful data with no strings attached, or even
everything sans business intelligence over the data (& tries to compete on
other vectors, not exclusive data access).

Greetings,
Emanuil

hi Jan,

This is useful - it's a great idea to see the license.

Re ""No additional restrictions ? You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits."

Comment: this applies to the work per se. It does not apply to a paywall that you have to go through to get to the work. Consider that for most of us we go through a paywall every time we access the internet, whether we are paying this ourselves or an organization is paying on our behalf. 

There can be measures that do not legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits that are neither legal terms nor "technological measures that legally restrict others...". For example, imagine that Elsevier buys out or is bought by an Internet Service Provider and net neutrality is legal in country X. Elsevier could then offer a for-pay service for the fast lane to PLoS material, while PLoS material could still be accessible to anyone to use their rights under the license, however on the slow lane. 

When considering the potential impact of legal terms like CC-BY, it is important to consider the overall context, including existing and potential new business practices and other laws such as those surround net neutrality. 

best,

Heather Morrison

In scholarship, it is important to state your background and any potential conflicts of interest. I am a professional academic and librarian and my interest in this area is ensuring that scholarly works are free to prioritize scholarship and the public good.

It would be helpful to the discussion for Emanuil Tolev and Mark MacGillivray to explain the interests of cottagelabs.com in this matter. 

best,

Heather Morrison

If they think it "makes my article free to read (and to text mine) [and open access]", then that's what will happen - eventually - regardless of how somebody else interprets the license to suit a perhaps ageing business model. They'll just think RightsLink is plain wrong to do what they do.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.
> However, it's my understanding that CC-BY-NC would prevent this kind of scenario. And as I said, not all scholars would be against this kind of scenario. But they aren't going to think about it when picking CC-BY-NC because "I don't want RightsLink to sell my article".

> Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go - we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)

Where is it located, what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)
>

CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much. If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?
> DOAJ kind of illustrates this in fact, since their data is under CC-BY-SA, which means that if I were to combine their dataset with other data, I'd have to release the result under CC-BY-SA, which may hurt MY downstream data consumers in ways I can't imagine.

People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not. People just take what they need when it's published, and we should recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in some cases even -SA).

And maybe (depending on personal values) because whoever does this would be concerned they'd hurt real people (they do work at publishing companies ..).

But I'll certainly think more of a business which publishes at least some good useful data with no strings attached, or even everything sans business intelligence over the data (& tries to compete on other vectors, not exclusive data access).

I see dangers to open access itself through CC-BY, in addition to these arguments that this focus on licensing ignores steps which would be much more effective in achieving the kind of re-use many CC-BY advocates argue for (attending to formats and metadata standards, for example).

An entry point into this argument that all proponents of CC-BY as default should pay attention to: there is nothing in any of the CC licenses that obligates either licensor or licensee to make materials free of charge. It is true that you cannot add DRM to a work downstream to enforce downstream property rights, but you can put up a paywall before the person gets to the work.

So in your scenario, Heather, CC-BY-NC secures that there won't be the possibility of a fast lane at all. How can that be better?

hi Jan,

To be clear: I am against requiring any particular license for open access works. As the UK Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) committee concluded after their recent OA policy consultation, this is an area that requires more research.

best,

Heather Morrison

This is like saying "I am against requiring any particular price for
gratis works".

Hi Heather,

The 'requirement' is that what one calls open access IS truly open access. Any licence that covers open access works should reflect that. Of the CC-licences, only CC-BY does. NC is an impediment to use scientific works to their full extent, and thereby renders works under an NC licence unsuitable to the label 'open access'. It may be called 'free', 'gratis', etc., but calling works 'open access' when under an NC licence makes the very term 'open access' ambiguous and confusing to the point of being useless. I'm reaching the point where I am considering using only the terms 'CC-BY-Access' or 'BOAI-compliant OA' when referring to what used to be simply 'open access'.

Of course, free, gratis, access is not in itself a 'bad' thing, certainly compared with paywall-access, but is not as good as it could be if it were truly BOAI-compliant OA, and not sufficient for optimum usage in science.

Best,

Jan

Hi Heather,

The 'requirement' is that what one calls open access IS truly open access. Any licence that covers open access works should reflect that. Of the CC-licences, only CC-BY does. NC is an impediment to use scientific works to their full extent, and thereby renders works under an NC licence unsuitable to the label 'open access'. It may be called 'free', 'gratis', etc., but calling works 'open access' when under an NC licence makes the very term 'open access' ambiguous and confusing to the point of being useless. I'm reaching the point where I am considering using only the terms 'CC-BY-Access' or 'BOAI-compliant OA' when referring to what used to be simply 'open access'.

Of course, free, gratis, access is not in itself a 'bad' thing, certainly compared with paywall-access, but is not as good as it could be if it were truly BOAI-compliant OA, and not sufficient for optimum usage in science.

Best,

Jan

Hmm? I'll try a more prosaic approach. What is the more efficient and 
clearer license for scientific productions?

CC-BY-SA: the work can be republished providing the authors are quoted 
and the license remains the same ? granted?

CC-BY: the work can be republished providing the authors are quoted. The 
license is not viral, yet in compliance with the "no additional 
restriction" provision, the work should go somewhat viral, but that's 
only a guess, so that in fact the work remains in quantum state 
somewhere between virality and un-virality?

CC-BY-NC: the work can be republished proving the authors are quoted. 
The work should not be sold. If the selling merely covers some diffusion 
expenses (printing a book, acquiring an USB key), it should perhaps be 
alright, yet we don't know for sure, so that you would feel better 
avoiding it.

European public domain: the work can be republished providing the 
authors are quoted (in compliance with moral rights) and the license 
remains the same (otherwise it would fall into copyfraud) ? it would 
require a better legal shelter (as public domain is always defined in a 
negative way) but, nevertheless, granted?

We don't even need to speculate over the social effects of the license. 
CC-BY and CC-BY-NC are not a good solution, not on account on some 
negative effects on scientific production and diffusion, but because 
they are not clear. CC-BY-SA or even european public domain (if someday 
european countries really tackles this issue of giving it a positive 
definition) give a more efficient legal frame.

May I remember

Graf, K, Thatcher, S. (2012). Point & Counterpoint: Is CC BY the Best Open
Access License?.*Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication*
1(1):eP1043.
http://dx.doi.org/10.7710/2162-3309.1043

It's clear for me that NC is in the context of commercial scholarly
publishing nonsense. A copyright protected image cannot be re-used in any
commercial journal and there is some evidence that the leading OA journals
like PLoS are indeed commercial in the sense of the NC clause.

I've got nothing to add to Mark's description of Cottage Labs. I'm a
software developer, not a currently active scholar. I'd rather that all
scholars and the public could access each other's work. I'd also like to
see good business and not-for-profit initiatives building on top of that
work and making it even easier to access, relate, analyse and derive value
from (and drive research forward). I want all the text, all the data and
all the metadata open (as per the Open Definition ideally) so that this
kind of innovation can develop, coming both from scholars themselves and
others who wish to help scholarship.

The GPL is a great example. The GPL is copyleft, i.e. -SA. Turned out,
though, that companies can't always share all their code for competitive
reasons.
"Amazing! Sharing is forever encouraged and *required*!", said those who
liked GPL.
"Err..", said the software developer who received tens of requests for dual
licensing from companies wanting to use his GPL code in great commercial
applications that he would have allowed without asking. They couldn't
open-source their core products though.
"I just wanted to share my code and I was told this is how you do open
source by a friend. I don't really want to deal with all this admin work.
Rejecting them all is bad too, I like some of them a lot. Maybe I need to
change my license."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- Now dual-licensed under MIT ( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) and GPL

"Hm, we don't like this. You should have just left them in the mud if they
wouldn't share their enhancements to the code." - said supporters of the
GPL.
"Well, actually they did share some *other* code and other stuff, because
they felt compelled to and it has so many benefits, like attracting
talented developers. Also it got really bad really quickly - I never
realised other open source projects would be prevented from using my code
and now I'm really angry!"
- "Huh? How come?", asked the GPL supporters.
- "Well if they've picked MIT to be commercially friendly or because they
didn't care about forcing sharing, they can't use the GPL. It's copyleft,
remember? They have to release a GPL version of their code if they use any
of mine! I never meant to force other developers to pick a license for
their work!"
- "Well, they should make this little bit of effort and join the true
sharing community and make sure their work is forever shareable.", retorted
GPL supporters.
- "I'm angry now I'm even spending time on this issue. I wanted to code and
share my code. And discuss this with others. Not discuss licenses. I am no
longer participating in this discussion."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- No longer licensed under the GPL. If you want to use the GPL code for
some odd reason, go back to the version which had it. Beware, no support of
any kind will be offered for old versions. Use the latest version to report
any problems or bugs.

And so, except in some exceptional cases, nowadays the majority of open
source code is not GPL, but one of the other ones listed here under Popular
Licenses: http://opensource.org/licenses , all created to serve different
needs, but none containing blanket restrictions like -NC and -SA. (There
are still quite a few GPL projects.)

Obviously papers are not code and one wouldn't necessarily mix & match text
from papers to produce new papers. However, the lessons learned from trying
to apply downstream restrictions still hold true. (And besides, who am I to
say there isn't a truly good and innovative idea to be had in mix &
matching scholarly papers.) Newly minted software developers like me
usually know this: Do. not. restrict. usage. of. your. open. source. code.
without exceedingly good narrow reasons forced by a very specific situation
on you. You will end up hurting causes and projects you like, and will not
stop those who only wish to take and not contribute back.

I feel that there's such a big push for CC-BY because people are concerned
about fragmenting the scholarly sector in superficial legal ways. The
cracks take a lot of time and frustration to close, and we'll end up
consolidating anyway, because the benefits of consolidation so greatly
outweigh the negatives in practice. If we don't flock towards one (any one)
license or a small group, look what happens:
http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical . This situation is frustrating
- how can I tell if any 2 or 3 licenses are compatible? What if I'm given
the task of combining materials licensed under 2 or 3 of them? I'm not a
lawyer, I don't know! So I just won't perform the task.
Or if it's critical, I will combine the materials and ignore the licensing.
I have no other choice. I've no time to deal with this!

I'd really rather that this situation does not repeat from the software
sector into the scholarly sector.

I'm definitely against forcing a license on people. However, I don't
consider it necessary to pick a different license to what everybody else
has picked if that serves my needs too. CC-BY seems to serve scholars'
needs (I'm not one, hence "seems").

Greetings,
Emanuil

CC BY-SA (and CC0) are also OKD conformant.

Remember, if possible in your jurisdiction, you can always use CC0 for pretty much any and everything.

Yes, perhaps. All depends on whose religion you want to believe in. FSF does recommend CC0 for PD dedication (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0) and CC mentions the same in their FAQ as well (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F)

CC is interested in possibly working on removing the one hitch that caused OSI to not recommend CC0 (http://opensource.org/faq#cc-zero), but that concern may not apply to many software developers.

What problems other than those mentioned in the links above?

In response to the question of conflict of interest:

I am Mark MacGillivray, an academic at the University of Edinburgh,
currently completing my PhD entitled Studies in open scholarship. I have
shared information in relation to my studies on these lists previously. It
is in this capacity that I engage in these lists, as I have done so both
prior to my PhD course but in other studies, and prior to the existence of
Cottage Labs.

I am also a Founder and Senior partner of Cottage Labs LLP, where Emanuil
is an associate. Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is
an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the
purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that
wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests
nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in
the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those
involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and
what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.

Cottage Labs develops open source software for a range of people, most
commonly academic or academic-related people and institutions. We get paid
for our skills and time, which we openly negotiate on every project we work
for, and the output of our work is made freely available to be used by
anyone at no extra cost, for whatever they want.

However, despite making the output of our work freely available, and
demonstrating and documenting how to use it, and helping people install and
set up services using that material, we have found that there are a large
number of people and organisations who simply do not have the technical
capability to be able to run their own services. Hence, we have found that
even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want
to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us
to run services.

So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the
as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would
like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so
I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most
academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need -
e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is
reasonable.

So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable
price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including
paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the
service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong
with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely
free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even
use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too.
Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding
myself to account.

That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free.
So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy
food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not
without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content
or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and
neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it,
nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.

Here is an interesting point I am freely willing to admit: in every project
I have been involved in to date, the only thing that licensing demands have
done for the project is to increase its complexity. This means that
managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to
improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the
software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please
can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because
increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the
case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher
cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased
profit.

By taking the conflict of interest that is the restrictions on usability of
scholarly (or any) content out of the equation altogether, what we have
left is a complete freedom to act on our willingness to work together with
people who share our goals, and to collaborate and trade based on the
skills we have to offer rather than the products we can stockpile.

In my personal opinion, restriction simply places demands on other people
despite having no idea what it is they may want to do, and no idea of how
it may benefit or hinder any particular goal. It is a fearful approach to
what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even
argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is
pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the
first place.

If an academic of the future were to find something of interest to them,
would you prefer that they pay close attention to the licensing conditions
of said item when deciding whether to prioritise it for scholarship and
their public good, or that they make their evaluation based on the
qualities of the item itself? I would hope that they treat the licensing as
nothing more than dirt to be swept off the cover.

Thank you for the clarification, Mark, this is most helpful. It strikes me that you are talking about coding and open source. This is very different from open access to scholarly journal articles and monographs, and the questions around copyright and licensing are very different as well.

Wouldn't the GNU public license be more appropriate here than any of the CC licenses?

best,

Heather Morrison

In response to the question of conflict of interest:

I am Mark MacGillivray, an academic at the University of Edinburgh, currently completing my PhD entitled Studies in open scholarship. I have shared information in relation to my studies on these lists previously. It is in this capacity that I engage in these lists, as I have done so both prior to my PhD course but in other studies, and prior to the existence of Cottage Labs.

I am also a Founder and Senior partner of Cottage Labs LLP, where Emanuil is an associate. Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.

Cottage Labs develops open source software for a range of people, most commonly academic or academic-related people and institutions. We get paid for our skills and time, which we openly negotiate on every project we work for, and the output of our work is made freely available to be used by anyone at no extra cost, for whatever they want.

However, despite making the output of our work freely available, and demonstrating and documenting how to use it, and helping people install and set up services using that material, we have found that there are a large number of people and organisations who simply do not have the technical capability to be able to run their own services. Hence, we have found that even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us to run services.

So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need - e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is reasonable.

So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.

That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free. So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it, nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.

Here is an interesting point I am freely willing to admit: in every project I have been involved in to date, the only thing that licensing demands have done for the project is to increase its complexity. This means that managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased profit.

By taking the conflict of interest that is the restrictions on usability of scholarly (or any) content out of the equation altogether, what we have left is a complete freedom to act on our willingness to work together with people who share our goals, and to collaborate and trade based on the skills we have to offer rather than the products we can stockpile.

In my personal opinion, restriction simply places demands on other people despite having no idea what it is they may want to do, and no idea of how it may benefit or hinder any particular goal. It is a fearful approach to what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the first place.

If an academic of the future were to find something of interest to them, would you prefer that they pay close attention to the licensing conditions of said item when deciding whether to prioritise it for scholarship and their public good, or that they make their evaluation based on the qualities of the item itself? I would hope that they treat the licensing as nothing more than dirt to be swept off the cover.

If they think it "makes my article free to read (and to text mine) [and open access]", then that's what will happen - eventually - regardless of how somebody else interprets the license to suit a perhaps ageing business model. They'll just think RightsLink is plain wrong to do what they do.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.
> However, it's my understanding that CC-BY-NC would prevent this kind of scenario. And as I said, not all scholars would be against this kind of scenario. But they aren't going to think about it when picking CC-BY-NC because "I don't want RightsLink to sell my article".

> Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go - we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)
>
> There's an entirely separate issue that's usually conflated with the published work itself - the metadata about the work. Where is it located, what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)
>
> Again, even if we somehow created this data from scratch (scraping and so on), then how would we publish it? CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much. If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?
> DOAJ kind of illustrates this in fact, since their data is under CC-BY-SA, which means that if I were to combine their dataset with other data, I'd have to release the result under CC-BY-SA, which may hurt MY downstream data consumers in ways I can't imagine.

> Additionally, attaching restrictions to data use is practically useless unless you can back your copyright infringement claims up. People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not. People just take what they need when it's published, and we should recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in some cases even -SA).
>
> The reason we can't go and download all the papers from publishers' websites like Aaron Swartz did is not because their incredible restrictive website ToS says so, it's because they have enough cash to back up their ToS. And maybe (depending on personal values) because whoever does this would be concerned they'd hurt real people (they do work at publishing companies ..).

> 1. kills little innovative side projects people think up, because they actually paid attention to the licensing and it forbade them from using the data, and they were afraid enough of copyright law / potential bad reputation not to go ahead

> #2 is sometimes acceptable, we can't tell businesses not to compete or give all their data away! But I'll certainly think more of a business which publishes at least some good useful data with no strings attached, or even everything sans business intelligence over the data (& tries to compete on other vectors, not exclusive data access).

An entry point into this argument that all proponents of CC-BY as default should pay attention to: there is nothing in any of the CC licenses that obligates either licensor or licensee to make materials free of charge. It is true that you cannot add DRM to a work downstream to enforce downstream property rights, but you can put up a paywall before the person gets to the work.

I've got nothing to add to Mark's description of Cottage Labs. I'm a
software developer, not a currently active scholar. I'd rather that all
scholars and the public could access each other's work. I'd also like to
see good business and not-for-profit initiatives building on top of that
work and making it even easier to access, relate, analyse and derive value
from (and drive research forward). I want all the text, all the data and
all the metadata open (as per the Open Definition ideally) so that this
kind of innovation can develop, coming both from scholars themselves and
others who wish to help scholarship.

The GPL is a great example. The GPL is copyleft, i.e. -SA. Turned out,
though, that companies can't always share all their code for competitive
reasons.
"Amazing! Sharing is forever encouraged and *required*!", said those who
liked GPL.
"Err..", said the software developer who received tens of requests for dual
licensing from companies wanting to use his GPL code in great commercial
applications that he would have allowed without asking. They couldn't
open-source their core products though.
"I just wanted to share my code and I was told this is how you do open
source by a friend. I don't really want to deal with all this admin work.
Rejecting them all is bad too, I like some of them a lot. Maybe I need to
change my license."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- Now dual-licensed under MIT ( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) and GPL

"Hm, we don't like this. You should have just left them in the mud if they
wouldn't share their enhancements to the code." - said supporters of the
GPL.
"Well, actually they did share some *other* code and other stuff, because
they felt compelled to and it has so many benefits, like attracting
talented developers. Also it got really bad really quickly - I never
realised other open source projects would be prevented from using my code
and now I'm really angry!"
- "Huh? How come?", asked the GPL supporters.
- "Well if they've picked MIT to be commercially friendly or because they
didn't care about forcing sharing, they can't use the GPL. It's copyleft,
remember? They have to release a GPL version of their code if they use any
of mine! I never meant to force other developers to pick a license for
their work!"
- "Well, they should make this little bit of effort and join the true
sharing community and make sure their work is forever shareable.", retorted
GPL supporters.
- "I'm angry now I'm even spending time on this issue. I wanted to code and
share my code. And discuss this with others. Not discuss licenses. I am no
longer participating in this discussion."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- No longer licensed under the GPL. If you want to use the GPL code for
some odd reason, go back to the version which had it. Beware, no support of
any kind will be offered for old versions. Use the latest version to report
any problems or bugs.

And so, except in some exceptional cases, nowadays the majority of open
source code is not GPL, but one of the other ones listed here under Popular
Licenses: http://opensource.org/licenses , all created to serve different
needs, but none containing blanket restrictions like -NC and -SA. (There
are still quite a few GPL projects.)

Obviously papers are not code and one wouldn't necessarily mix & match text
from papers to produce new papers. However, the lessons learned from trying
to apply downstream restrictions still hold true. (And besides, who am I to
say there isn't a truly good and innovative idea to be had in mix &
matching scholarly papers.) Newly minted software developers like me
usually know this: Do. not. restrict. usage. of. your. open. source. code.
without exceedingly good narrow reasons forced by a very specific situation
on you. You will end up hurting causes and projects you like, and will not
stop those who only wish to take and not contribute back.

I feel that there's such a big push for CC-BY because people are concerned
about fragmenting the scholarly sector in superficial legal ways. The
cracks take a lot of time and frustration to close, and we'll end up
consolidating anyway, because the benefits of consolidation so greatly
outweigh the negatives in practice. If we don't flock towards one (any one)
license or a small group, look what happens:
http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical . This situation is frustrating
- how can I tell if any 2 or 3 licenses are compatible? What if I'm given
the task of combining materials licensed under 2 or 3 of them? I'm not a
lawyer, I don't know! So I just won't perform the task.
Or if it's critical, I will combine the materials and ignore the licensing.
I have no other choice. I've no time to deal with this!

I'd really rather that this situation does not repeat from the software
sector into the scholarly sector.

I'm definitely against forcing a license on people. However, I don't
consider it necessary to pick a different license to what everybody else
has picked if that serves my needs too. CC-BY seems to serve scholars'
needs (I'm not one, hence "seems").

Greetings,
Emanuil

Hi,

I would like to second Emanuil's concerns, and am in a similar
situation. I have done a lot of work in open source, including many
GPL communities. The open source community abandoned NC, ND etc very
early on as they do not fit in any open landscape - commercial
activity can be so ambiguous and you are restricting certain groups
from taking part. Copyleft/SA make requirements on everything, not
just the licensed work, leading to discussions/analysis/time spent
figuring out compatibility etc.

I favor permissive licenses now for software, and hope to see the same
for scientific works and data. I really hope that open access can be
defined simply as CC-BY or equally permissive, without having to
figure out you meant the CC-BY-SA-NC-ND version. I am pleased to see
Creative Commons went ahead and made it clear that NC, ND etc are not
free cultural work approved too.

These concerns are real, and I sincerely hope that the open access
term can be reserved for works with no restriction on where/how they
are used, just like open source is. I disagree that the licensing
questions are very different, and in fact feel there are many
commonalities in the debate. I totally agree that software licenses
should be used for software, and CC licenses are better suited to
publishing, but access and reuse are important commonalities shared by
both communities.

Certainly, although MIT/BSD is generally better recognized and
understood in the context of software. I won't push the topic
off-track too much, I think the OKD definition of open access nicely
mirrors the OSI's definition of open source. CC0 does not appear in
their list of OSI approved licenses, which would make its application
in software problematic for many.

FSF does recommend CC0 for PD dedication (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0) and CC mentions the same in their FAQ as well (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F)

Religion is a bit of a loaded term, but for many commercial developers
the OSI analysis is an important one as they invest the time to
analyze licenses for potential pitfalls. If it is not OSI-approved,
then it is often a non-starter as legal teams at companies will often
employ that as a minimum bar. See for example Google's Summer of Code
program FAQ as a public example,

Perhaps not, although it speaks to a certain amount of brand
recognition. I trust the OKD list of open access licenses, and the OSI
list of open source licenses.

I would say part of it is recognition, many of us in software know
what we are getting with MIT, 3-clause BSD, GPLv2, GPLv3+, etc. In
addition, the MIT, BSD, Apache licenses have been around longer, legal
teams recognize them pretty quickly and many debates have already been
had and settled. This may change over time, part of it is likely a
marketing/communication issue for Creative Commons. These are purely
my opinions as a developer working for an open-source scientific
software company in the US (previously academia in the UK), and I work
with many who still feel GPL is needed to ensure freedom...

Sincerely,

Marcus

Having said that, the background about Cottage Labs is very interesting, and makes a good case study, and IMO a compelling case for more open licenses on research output: plainly Cottage Labs provides important and valuable services to the research community, and obstacles, such as NC licenses, which make those services harder, and therefore more expensive, are undesirable and act as a taxation on other researchers.  This equally applies to other organisations providing services to researchers and educators (like, say, Kitware, or the CCF): people ought to be paid for their work, they will have to do more work to overcome such obstacles, and that money is obviously going to come out of research and education budgets.

I work on science software process improvement, under the CCF umbrella.  CCF is a non-profit organisation, and I am not paid for the work, but it could certainly be held to be ?commercial? in a court.  If I find I have to read NC-licensed research (for instance, a social science paper on the growth of the use of alt metrics in institutional systems of professional recognition and advancement) as part of my CCF work (say: to prepare a workshop presentation on the importance of open-source licensing of scientific software), then I might either 

(a) ignore the license and read it anyway;
(b) disregard the research and find something else to make my point;
(c) spend time figuring out whether there?s a paywall alternative, how much it might cost, and whether it?s worth it (based on the abstract); or
(d) contact the rights owners and beg an exemption.

NC advocates appear to want me to do (c) or (d).  Frankly, I rarely make those choices, and I doubt whether other people working in similar organisations make them either.

If Mark needs to read a research paper in order to do his work, then an NC license on that paper inhibits him from doing so.  The same would be true were he a plumber or a chef.

Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all.

I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics.

If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers.

An entry point into this argument that all proponents of CC-BY as default should pay attention to: there is nothing in any of the CC licenses that obligates either licensor or licensee to make materials free of charge. It is true that you cannot add DRM to a work downstream to enforce downstream property rights, but you can put up a paywall before the person gets to the work.

To clarify: NC, noncommercial, does not prohibit reading works or using the ideas in the works. Copyright covers expression, not ideas; anyone can use the ideas found in an All Rights Reserved work.

Since we are talking about two different things - software and scholarly articles - can you explain why you would want to include a whole scholarly article in software? I am trying to picture the typical scholarly article in PDF form inserted into a piece of software but am not quite seeing why anyone would want to do that. Perhaps it might make sense to link to a full article? If so, you can do this regardless of the copyright license of the article - even All Rights Reserved.

What noncommercial clearly prohibits is reselling the work for a profit. For example, anyone can read Larry Lessig's freely available NC licensed book, Free Culture, but printing copies in order to make a profit is not permitted. There are many kinds of uses where there is no consensus on whether the use is commercial or not, grey areas. 

Note that even CC-BY does not mean you can do whatever. Aside from the requirement of attribution, the author has moral rights. In some jurisdictions (US) these moral rights are stronger than with automatic copyright.

If anyone engaging in this discussion would like to learn about or brush up on the basics of "intellectual property", I recommend the World Intellectual Property Organization's "About Intellectual Property" page: http://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/

Lessig's Free Culture and Vaidhyanathan's Copyrights and Copywrongs are good introductions to the cultural issues. 

Anyone can read any of these works, even though I'm fairly confident that none of them are available with CC-BY licensed versions. 

best,

Heather Morrison

This equally applies to other organisations providing services to researchers and educators (like, say, Kitware, or the CCF): people ought to be paid for their work, they will have to do more work to overcome such obstacles, and that money is obviously going to come out of research and education budgets.

CCF is a non-profit organisation, and I am not paid for the work, but it could certainly be held to be ?commercial? in a court.  If I find I have to read NC-licensed research (for instance, a social science paper on the growth of the use of alt metrics in institutional systems of professional recognition and advancement) as part of my CCF work (say: to prepare a workshop presentation on the importance of open-source licensing of scientific software), then I might either

As it happens, part of his work product is software, which is open-source licensed (for instance, a quick look at the Cottage Labs site suggests that DSpace has a BSD-like license), but AIUI that is not relevant to his main point here.  If Mark needs to read a research paper in order to do his work, then an NC license on that paper inhibits him from doing so.  The same would be true were he a plumber or a chef.

Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.

Hence, we have found that even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us to run services.

>>>> So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need - e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is reasonable.
>>>> 
>>>> So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.
>>>> 
>>>> That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free. So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it, nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.
>>>>

This means that managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased profit.

It is a fearful approach to what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the first place.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.

>>>>> Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go - we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)

Where is it located, what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)
>>>>> 
>>>>> Again, even if we somehow created this data from scratch (scraping and so on), then how would we publish it? CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much. If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?

People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not.

Thank you very much, Mark ~ just to be sure we are all clear on what you are talking about, a question for you below ~

The theoretical service I described does not embed scholarly articles in software. It delivers such articles to consumers, via a method that is implemented using software that I write, amongst other things.

This service performs a function, therefore it cannot be achieved without effort. In return for expending the effort of creating and maintaining the service, I require reimbursement - because if I cannot engage in fair trade for my skills, I have no choice but to seek alternative ways to survive.

Question

It sounds to me like you are planning a service that involves charging people to deliver open access articles. This would be similar to RightsLink taking free open access articles and charging people for them. Am I getting this right? 

best,

Heather Morrison

> Mark is completely right. RightsLink is a TaxCollecting service for
publishers. Nothing more. It adds no value to the author or user - in facts
it adds negative value by preventing easy re-use.

Publishers such as BMC and PLOS do not route users to RightsLink. They make
is clear in many obvious places that the reader has almost complete rights
- except that they have to acknowledge the author (CC-BY).

By contrast many publishers (especially of hybrids) put a prominent
"Request Permissions" on the splash page which takes people to RightsLink.
If the paper is CC-BY then RightsLink SHOULD display a notice saying "You
are free to use and reuse and redistribute this article without charge for
whatever purpose - see CC-BY licence". In practice many of them issues
charges via RightsLink for CC-BY articles. This is unacceptable and similar
to the many companies (as in UK PPI) who offer charged services for content
or services that the government make freely / openly available.

The commonest offender is Elsevier where CC-BY papers frequently link to
RightsLink and are charged. I have highlighted many examples on my blog (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr) and Elsevier says it's "technical problems"
and "please give them time to fix it". It should never have happened. I
have no idea whether they refund money.

Although the first port of call is usually an Elsevier website. As there
may be other routes in to RightsLink, it would be good to fix that -
however Elsevier really haven't got an excuse for not making the rights of
an Open Access article clear on their own website and not routing through
to RightsLink in the first place.

Mark is talking about using research papers in the course of his work.  As it happens, part of his work product is software, which is open-source licensed (for instance, a quick look at the Cottage Labs site suggests that DSpace has a BSD-like license), but AIUI that is not relevant to his main point here.  If Mark needs to read a research paper in order to do his work, then an NC license on that paper inhibits him from doing so.  The same would be true were he a plumber or a chef.

I have shared information in relation to my studies on these lists previously. It is in this capacity that I engage in these lists, as I have done so both prior to my PhD course but in other studies, and prior to the existence of Cottage Labs.
>> 
>> I am also a Founder and Senior partner of Cottage Labs LLP, where Emanuil is an associate. Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.
>> 
>> Cottage Labs develops open source software for a range of people, most commonly academic or academic-related people and institutions. We get paid for our skills and time, which we openly negotiate on every project we work for, and the output of our work is made freely available to be used by anyone at no extra cost, for whatever they want.
>> 
>> However, despite making the output of our work freely available, and demonstrating and documenting how to use it, and helping people install and set up services using that material, we have found that there are a large number of people and organisations who simply do not have the technical capability to be able to run their own services. Hence, we have found that even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us to run services.
>> 
>> So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need - e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is reasonable.
>> 
>> So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.
>> 
>> That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free. So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it, nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.
>> 
>> Here is an interesting point I am freely willing to admit: in every project I have been involved in to date, the only thing that licensing demands have done for the project is to increase its complexity. This means that managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased profit.
>> 
>> By taking the conflict of interest that is the restrictions on usability of scholarly (or any) content out of the equation altogether, what we have left is a complete freedom to act on our willingness to work together with people who share our goals, and to collaborate and trade based on the skills we have to offer rather than the products we can stockpile.
>> 
>> In my personal opinion, restriction simply places demands on other people despite having no idea what it is they may want to do, and no idea of how it may benefit or hinder any particular goal. It is a fearful approach to what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the first place.
>> 
>> If an academic of the future were to find something of interest to them, would you prefer that they pay close attention to the licensing conditions of said item when deciding whether to prioritise it for scholarship and their public good, or that they make their evaluation based on the qualities of the item itself?

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.

So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)

CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much.

People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not. People just take what they need when it's published, and we should recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in some cases even -SA).

An entry point into this argument that all proponents of CC-BY as default should pay attention to: there is nothing in any of the CC licenses that obligates either licensor or licensee to make materials free of charge. It is true that you cannot add DRM to a work downstream to enforce downstream property rights, but you can put up a paywall before the person gets to the work.

I agree with Heather: text and data mining falls into the informational 
public domain. This practice is only indirectly concerned with 
intellectual property. You may frequently need to get a substantial copy 
of a copyrighted/licensed text or database in order to develop an 
application or to do some big data research (like, for instance, the 
text2genome project). The US jurisprudence considers these copies to be 
compliant with fair use: there is no harm done to the rights holders 
(see for instance the latest decision on Google Books). In Europe this 
is much more complicated. There is no counterpart to fair use and 
database legislation is far more tricky (it is not only covered by 
copyright, but also by sui generis database rights since 1996). Even 
though, several european states (the United Kingdom and Ireland to name 
a few) are contemplating an exception. I have also been recently 
auditioned by the Intellectual Property Council of France on the legal 
issues surrounding text and data mining. They seem quite receptive to an 
exception.

Otherwise, I'm still a little annoyed to see that the debate focuses 
heavily on CC-BY v. CC-NC. _Both_ of theses licenses are quite unclear 
and do not create an effective legal security for reuse. CC-BY sounds as 
an uncomplete viral license : I'm not sure a lot of project (perhaps not 
even Cottage Labs) can really comply with the ? No additional 
restrictions ? specification. CC-NC prevents numerous legitimate uses. 
CC-BY-SA appears as the clearer legal framework. It may require some 
juggling from one legal status to another (even though, that would not 
be a matter at a "data" level as informational public domain rules). 
That's a very little drawback in comparison with a wide set of 
advantages : no arbitrary distinction between commercial and 
uncommercial, strong incentives for institutions to go beyond a 
copyright-centered approach, no more risks of adding new enclosures to 
open access content?

I am trying to picture the typical scholarly article in PDF form inserted into a piece of software but am not quite seeing why anyone would want to do that. Perhaps it might make sense to link to a full article? If so, you can do this regardless of the copyright license of the article - even All Rights Reserved.

> What noncommercial clearly prohibits is reselling the work for a profit. For example, anyone can read Larry Lessig's freely available NC licensed book, Free Culture, but printing copies in order to make a profit is not permitted. There are many kinds of uses where there is no consensus on whether the use is commercial or not, grey areas.

This equally applies to other organisations providing services to researchers and educators (like, say, Kitware, or the CCF): people ought to be paid for their work, they will have to do more work to overcome such obstacles, and that money is obviously going to come out of research and education budgets.

It is in this capacity that I engage in these lists, as I have done so both prior to my PhD course but in other studies, and prior to the existence of Cottage Labs.
>>>>>
>>>>> I am also a Founder and Senior partner of Cottage Labs LLP, where Emanuil is an associate. Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.
>>>>>
>>>>> Cottage Labs develops open source software for a range of people, most commonly academic or academic-related people and institutions. We get paid for our skills and time, which we openly negotiate on every project we work for, and the output of our work is made freely available to be used by anyone at no extra cost, for whatever they want.
>>>>>
>>>>> However, despite making the output of our work freely available, and demonstrating and documenting how to use it, and helping people install and set up services using that material, we have found that there are a large number of people and organisations who simply do not have the technical capability to be able to run their own services. Hence, we have found that even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us to run services.
>>>>>
>>>>> So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need - e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is reasonable.
>>>>>
>>>>> So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.
>>>>>
>>>>> That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free. So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it, nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.
>>>>>
>>>>> Here is an interesting point I am freely willing to admit: in every project I have been involved in to date, the only thing that licensing demands have done for the project is to increase its complexity. This means that managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased profit.
>>>>>
>>>>> By taking the conflict of interest that is the restrictions on usability of scholarly (or any) content out of the equation altogether, what we have left is a complete freedom to act on our willingness to work together with people who share our goals, and to collaborate and trade based on the skills we have to offer rather than the products we can stockpile.

It is a fearful approach to what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the first place.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.
>>>>>> However, it's my understanding that CC-BY-NC would prevent this kind of scenario. And as I said, not all scholars would be against this kind of scenario. But they aren't going to think about it when picking CC-BY-NC because "I don't want RightsLink to sell my article".

>>>>>> Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go - we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)
>>>>>>
>>>>>> There's an entirely separate issue that's usually conflated with the published work itself - the metadata about the work. Where is it located, what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)
>>>>>>
>>>>>> Again, even if we somehow created this data from scratch (scraping and so on), then how would we publish it? CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much. If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?
>>>>>> DOAJ kind of illustrates this in fact, since their data is under CC-BY-SA, which means that if I were to combine their dataset with other data, I'd have to release the result under CC-BY-SA, which may hurt MY downstream data consumers in ways I can't imagine.
>>>>>>
>>>>>> So yes, CC-BY comes with no strings attached for downstream usage because that hurts the flow of information and makes people deal with unintended (sometimes to the point of being silly) scenarios when they should be focussing on running their business or otherwise enhancing society.
>>>>>>
>>>>>> Additionally, attaching restrictions to data use is practically useless unless you can back your copyright infringement claims up. People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not. People just take what they need when it's published, and we should recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in some cases even -SA).
>>>>>>
>>>>>> The reason we can't go and download all the papers from publishers' websites like Aaron Swartz did is not because their incredible restrictive website ToS says so, it's because they have enough cash to back up their ToS. And maybe (depending on personal values) because whoever does this would be concerned they'd hurt real people (they do work at publishing companies ..).

Many thanks to Mark, Emanuil, Nick, Marcus and others who have answered in
detail. This list is showing its value as a primary place where rational
discussions on "open access" can take place.

I should make it clear that there is no a priori requirement on this list
(which I asked OKFN to set up) to justify one's place of employment. Unless
someone makes it clear that they are offering a company position then they
are taken at face value. There is no implied hierarchy of merit with
academia at the top and companies inferior.

The OKFN works with bodies of all sorts but obviously those which wish to
or have espoused OKD-compliant approaches are the most common. I should
congratulate ClearClimateCode (Nick) , CottageLabs (Mark, Emanuil)  and
Kitware (Marcus, Luis Ibanez)  as having been incredibly active in
promoting Openness. All have not only made many products available but also
put huge effort into OKD-compliance  through discussions on lists and
formal statements to governments. Luis  wrote a very compelling submission
to the US government - far more than most academics have done.

Note that OKD specifically does not discriminate between fields of
endeavour.

To be clear, I am not objecting to people contributing from any perspective. My point is that it is helpful to the discussion about licensing to explain what it is you would like to do (or think people should be able to do), and for what purpose, respecting that some information may be confidential.

For example, based on the ideas Nick brought up today, I am wondering if what some business types might want is actually a ban on patenting of results of ideas arising from publicly funded research so that any entrepreneur can use them (if you want to use ideas for commercial purposes, that's a matter of patent law, not copyright law). If this is what is wanted, CC licenses of any type are not the answer.

I am still puzzled as to why anyone thinks it important that scholarly articles per se (the works as they are, mostly PDFs or chunks of PDFs) into software code. Can anyone enlighten me, perhaps provide an example (hypothetical is fine), illustrating why this would be desirable at all, never mind so desirable as to be a compelling argument to force every scholar in the world to pre-approve such a use on a blanket basis? (Referring to OA policies requiring CC-BY).

best,

Heather Morrison

Many thanks to Mark, Emanuil, Nick, Marcus and others who have answered in detail. This list is showing its value as a primary place where rational discussions on "open access" can take place.

I should make it clear that there is no a priori requirement on this list (which I asked OKFN to set up) to justify one's place of employment. Unless someone makes it clear that they are offering a company position then they are taken at face value. There is no implied hierarchy of merit with academia at the top and companies inferior.

The OKFN works with bodies of all sorts but obviously those which wish to or have espoused OKD-compliant approaches are the most common. I should congratulate ClearClimateCode (Nick) , CottageLabs (Mark, Emanuil)  and Kitware (Marcus, Luis Ibanez)  as having been incredibly active in promoting Openness. All have not only made many products available but also put huge effort into OKD-compliance  through discussions on lists and formal statements to governments. Luis  wrote a very compelling submission to the US government - far more than most academics have done.

Note that OKD specifically does not discriminate between fields of endeavour.

To clarify: NC, noncommercial, does not prohibit reading works or using the ideas in the works. Copyright covers expression, not ideas; anyone can use the ideas found in an All Rights Reserved work.

Since we are talking about two different things - software and scholarly articles - can you explain why you would want to include a whole scholarly article in software? I am trying to picture the typical scholarly article in PDF form inserted into a piece of software but am not quite seeing why anyone would want to do that. Perhaps it might make sense to link to a full article? If so, you can do this regardless of the copyright license of the article - even All Rights Reserved.

What noncommercial clearly prohibits is reselling the work for a profit. For example, anyone can read Larry Lessig's freely available NC licensed book, Free Culture, but printing copies in order to make a profit is not permitted. There are many kinds of uses where there is no consensus on whether the use is commercial or not, grey areas.

Note that even CC-BY does not mean you can do whatever. Aside from the requirement of attribution, the author has moral rights. In some jurisdictions (US) these moral rights are stronger than with automatic copyright.

If anyone engaging in this discussion would like to learn about or brush up on the basics of "intellectual property", I recommend the World Intellectual Property Organization's "About Intellectual Property" page: http://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/

Lessig's Free Culture and Vaidhyanathan's Copyrights and Copywrongs are good introductions to the cultural issues.

Anyone can read any of these works, even though I'm fairly confident that none of them are available with CC-BY licensed versions.

best,

Heather Morrison

This equally applies to other organisations providing services to researchers and educators (like, say, Kitware, or the CCF): people ought to be paid for their work, they will have to do more work to overcome such obstacles, and that money is obviously going to come out of research and education budgets.

Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.

Hence, we have found that even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us to run services.
>>>>
>>>> So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need - e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is reasonable.
>>>>
>>>> So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.
>>>>
>>>> That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free. So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it, nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.
>>>>
>>>> Here is an interesting point I am freely willing to admit: in every project I have been involved in to date, the only thing that licensing demands have done for the project is to increase its complexity. This means that managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased profit.

It is a fearful approach to what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the first place.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.

So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)

(Naturally this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)

CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much.

People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not.

Apologies for the continued derailment of this thread - congrats to the
starting announcement, the publication of the open science anthology.

The theoretical service I described does not embed scholarly articles in
software. It delivers such articles to consumers, via a method that is
implemented using software that I write, amongst other things.

This service performs a function, therefore it cannot be achieved without
effort. In return for expending the effort of creating and maintaining the
service, I require reimbursement - because if I cannot engage in fair trade
for my skills, I have no choice but to seek alternative ways to survive.

If nc clauses or sa clauses render my work more difficult, then I will earn
more money. As I already explained, the manufacture of scarcity serves to
increase profit. I will be forcibly engaged in unfair trade.

There are many people in the world capable of providing the theoretical
service I describe. When the objects to be delivered are unencumbered, and
when the functionality of the delivery method is freely replicable, we can
engage in free trade to come to a reasonable and mutually beneficial
agreement whereby the scholar receives the dissemination and accessibility
fundamental to their practice, and the service provider receives fair
remuneration for unpredatory dedication of their time and skills to the
practice of the scholar. Encumbrance serves only to reduce competition and
encourage monopoly.

As a scholar I wish to make my work as widely accessible and as widely
beneficial as possible, above all else. Secondly it would be nice to earn a
living by doing so, for example by being paid for performance of this art
to the benefit of a given community.

As a software developer I wish to use my skills to help people achieve
their goals, and to make a living in return for the time I spend doing so.

Neither of these require nc or sa. In fact they require no form of
copyright at all. The purpose of copyright is to enable profitability from
the act of copying. The purpose of intellectual property is to enable
saleability by attachment of ownership to ideas.

Both of these could, however, conveniently earn me extra income if I were
to start polluting the raw materials - scholarly articles and software -
and increasing scarcity.

So for me it is a simple question.

Do scholars wish to make their work as widely accessible as possible, as a
fundamental tenet of the scholarly practice?

If the answer to the above is yes, then I am in. Let's work out what is
required to do so, and get it done together as efficiently as possible. It
will be hard work for all of us, but sustainably rewarding.

If the answer is no, then I apologise in advance for getting rich whilst
being forced to take part in pointlessly over complicated software
development and service provision, serving only to support a community
willing to compromise fundamental tenets for the sake of convenience.

Just as a point of information (and taking no position for the moment
on which of the various licences is to be preferred): CC By is not a
viral licence. That term has a specific meaning --see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license -- that downstream works
must use the same licence: something that CC By explicitly does not
require. CC By-SA is viral, and so is the GNU GPL.

Hmm? This specification of CC-BY seems to create some kind of viral 
mechanism : ? No additional restrictions ? You may not apply legal terms 
or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing 
anything the license permits. ? Not adding any restrictions beyond what 
the license permits = cannot republish under stricter terms (which 
certainly includes copyright).

I agree this disposition is not as clear as what SA states. That's 
actually what made CC-BY a "weak" license, as we don't know for sure 
what are the terms of reuse ? the same problem goes with CC-NC?

Ha! You are quite right.

So does that mean that Elsevier is actually in contravention of the CC
By licence when they offer copies of CC By papers for a fee via
RightsLink? Probably not, given that they have (in nearly all cases)
coerced the author into signing copyright over to them. Under those
circumstances, of course, Elsevier (being the copyright holder) is at
liberty to distribute copies under other terms as well as CC By. But
if they obtained the paper by downloading a copy from elsewhere under
CC By, they would be in breach by doing so.

So my understanding of the distinction between CC By and CC By-SA is
now that the former is viral only with respect to COPIES of the
document so licenced, whereas the latter is also viral with respect to
derivative works.

Hi All

I?ve been watching the conversation but standing back, mainly because we?ve
gone around the NC/BY loop many times but I wanted to explain for Pierre of
why many of us are concerned about share-alike provisions and why this
matters particularly in research.

First some philosophical background. The Open Knowledge Foundation work on
definitions of open focusses on the issue of non-exclusion. That is, what
the Open Definition means by ?open? is that anyone is free to use the work,
and specifically that there are no restrictions on ?fields of use?. This
builds on earlier work with the Open Source Definition where again,
non-commercial restrictions were rejected because of they way they exclude
certain users. FWIW I agree with this philosophical grounding but disagree
with how it is interpreted in the Open Definition itself (more on that
below).

The question of ?virality? is two-fold. On one side there is the community
signalling an expectation that those that use a piece of work from the
commons, should contribute back to the commons. This is a community
principle, and arguably an ethical one. The genius of Richard Stallman was
to realise that you could use a legal tool, a license based on copyright, to
require that derivative work be contributed back. It has to be said this
worked very well in creating the world of Free and Open Source Software that
we have today. Indeed it worked so well that we now muddle the community
principle of contributing back with the legal tool itself.

One of the reasons that the tool, the GPL worked so well in software is
because you generally use code to make more code. And the distribution of
code is a natural consequence of making it. But even here its got messy and
the confusions around Affero GPL and LGPL illustrates. What if I just use
the library but don?t modify it? What if I build a web service on GPL code?
Is ?on the web? distributing? The complexities and the disagreements
illustrate the problem of using a legal instrument as the method of
community signalling.

Now research is more complex for a couple of reasons. First its (obviously)
not just articles, its also data, code, materials, and many other things,
many of which get combined together to create new data, code articles,
materials etc. If we use GPL-like or CC BY-SA licensing we can end up in bad
places such as: I use a CC BY-SA article to build a data set and a code
base. If I distribute these I am legally obliged to use a license which is
inappropriate for the object created (e.g. CC BY-SA license for code). And
yes I know there are ways to get around this in specific cases but its
special pleading which doesn?t scale. Viral licenses can force people to
distribute under licenses that actually give them less protection because of
the nature of thing being distributed, what jurisdiction its being
distributed from etc etc. (e.g. CC BY-SA for data distributed from the US is
problematic in my opinion, others argue that its more problematic in the EU
because people don?t realise the CC licenses involve waiving sui generic
database rights).

So issue one is the interchange of objects which can lead to being forced to
use a ?wrong? license. But there?s a much bigger issue which is around the
other obligations and rights associated with research objects. Let?s imagine
you?re involved in a clinical trial and you want to utilise some data which
is CC BY-SA (or ODBL-SA or GPL) to help normalise patient data. The
normalised identifiable patient data will be distributed to your consortium.
Your consortium has obviously signed a non-disclosure agreement relating to
this private data. You are also bound by ethical principles to not
distribute data in such a way that might make it leak out. Yet if you use
virally licensed data then you are obliged to use a license which gives
downstream receivers the right to redistribute. You are required to not bake
appropriate legal protections into the licensing regime of the data to
protect patient identities.

If we return to the original point ? Open is about non-exclusion ? this
means in practice that viral licenses can exclude the use of specific works
for specific purposes. This is particularly true of medical research but is
very common across research (an ecology community using ODBL-SA licensed
mapping data to assist with tracking a highly endangered species for
instance) where ethical and community standards require some measure of
protection or secrecy.

The bottom line is that the very power that makes viral licensing attractive
can have serious and unexpected side effects when they combine with other
obligations. These other obligations; legal, contractual, regulatory,
ethical, are common in research, and they are particularly common as we
transform and combine research objects from one thing to another. Data, used
by code, to generate an ontology, which supports a standard, which makes
papers more useful.

The Science Commons group and community spent a long time looking at this in
the middle part of the last decade but the conclusion they came to (and they
started honestly wanting to support viral approaches) was that its best to
keep the legal tools as simple as possible and build community standards and
expectations (and if necessary means of censure and punishment) to ensure
the point that I think we all share, the expectation, or at least hope, that
those who use the commons will contribute back to it.

CC-BY allows for commercial use, so that includes IMO also sales by RightsLink. Elsevier ? or any other publisher ? needs no special arrangement with the authors. Neither Elsevier nor RightsLink is in contravention of CC-BY as long as acknowledgement is given and the CC-BY terms indicated. (Elsevier will do that, presumably; not sure about RightsLink).

That's what I thought, too; but as Pierre-Carl pointed out, the CC By
definition at
        http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/
actually imposes TWO conditions. The first one, everyone knows:
"Attribution ? You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the
license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any
reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor
endorses you or your use." But there's also this second one: "No
additional restrictions ? You may not apply legal terms or
technological measures that legally restrict others from doing
anything the license permits."

Thanks for this insightful explanation, that answers several of my 
questions.

For one point, everything you say about CC-BY-SA goes also for CC-BY (in 
a less clear way : the viral mechanism of the "no additional 
restriction" specification remains unprecised).

The issue of data is in fact quite specific and Creative Commons are 
perhaps not the best tool to deal with that. Data, per se, are part of 
the informationnal public domain. They can never claim for any kind of 
protection (though we may consider that any attempt of "protecting" the 
individual data falls into the case of copyfraud). Most downstream 
application that makes an inventive use of individual data are never 
concerned with any kind of intellectual property (which includes CC 
licences for that sake). The protection only goes for something quite 
unclear: the substantial part of a database. The jurisprudence remains 
quite fuzzy. In France, most attemps to reclaim protection of a database 
have been rejected. In 1988, the Court of Cassation favored a database 
company, against the leading French newspaper, le Monde as the use of 
articles as data appeared "highly transformative". More recently, in 
2005, another leading French newspaper, Ouest-France was dismissed in a 
similar way.

It's in french, but you can read the recommandations I adressed to the 
French Intellectual Property Council with Lionel Maurel: 
http://www.savoirscom1.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Synthe%CC%80se-sur-le-statut-le%CC%81gal-du-content-mining.pdf

We argued in favor of clearly stating that data, per se, are part of the 
informationnal public domain. Use of substantive part of data should be 
clarified, through the creation of a ? fair dealing ?. I guess a lot of 
work could be done in order to enhance this tricky legislation.

For the purposes of full understanding of the implications of the CC-BY: I argue that RightsLink is perfectly within its legal rights to sell CC-BY licensed articles whether revenues are shared with the publisher or simply kept by RightsLink. This is a commercial use of the work, hence pre-authorized through the use of the CC-BY license. CC-BY does not impose an obligation on a downstream user to direct customers to free versions, merely a negative obligation to not actively prevent use of free versions. Further I argue that while there are many grey areas where there is no consensus on what constitutes commercial use, the RightsLink example - selling CC-BY articles for a profit - is a clearcut, straightforward, obvious commercial use. That is, if you don't want people to take your work and sell it for a profit, don't use CC-BY.

Note that this is not an argument for NC. No CC license requires "free of charge". An argument could be made that RightsLink could provide NC licensed articles, charging for their own service but not royalties for the article per se unless by arrangement with a copyright holder. Similarly if you print out an NC article you likely are paying for the paper and printing; this is not a commercial use of the article itself.

Thank you very much, Mark ~ just to be sure we are all clear on what you are talking about, a question for you below ~

It sounds to me like you are planning a service that involves charging people to deliver open access articles. This would be similar to RightsLink taking free open access articles and charging people for them. Am I getting this right?

No.

Mark

Mark is completely right. RightsLink is a TaxCollecting service for publishers. Nothing more. It adds no value to the author or user - in facts it adds negative value by preventing easy re-use.

Publishers such as BMC and PLOS do not route users to RightsLink. They make is clear in many obvious places that the reader has almost complete rights - except that they have to acknowledge the author (CC-BY).

By contrast many publishers (especially of hybrids) put a prominent "Request Permissions" on the splash page which takes people to RightsLink. If the paper is CC-BY then RightsLink SHOULD display a notice saying "You are free to use and reuse and redistribute this article without charge for whatever purpose - see CC-BY licence". In practice many of them issues charges via RightsLink for CC-BY articles. This is unacceptable and similar to the many companies (as in UK PPI) who offer charged services for content or services that the government make freely / openly available.

The commonest offender is Elsevier where CC-BY papers frequently link to RightsLink and are charged. I have highlighted many examples on my blog (http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr) and Elsevier says it's "technical problems" and "please give them time to fix it". It should never have happened. I have no idea whether they refund money.

I have no idea if this came up before, but I've found that funding is
quite the lever for enforcing certain policies. In order to eliminate
paywalls and the dominance of scientific and academic journals that
charge ridiculous amounts of money to access at all, much less own a
copy, one should eliminate government grants for research, and
substitute a system of funding that is not limited as government
grants can be, but is predicated on the assumption that the fruits of
research and academia is actually public, rather than
government-controlled.

When people refer to things like public transit, public libraries,
public universities, what people really mean is government-controlled
transit, government-controlled libraries, government-controlled
universities. From what I have begun to understand, governments tend
to feel entitled to tax money, and expect to get it, one way or
another. This means that you cannot use tax money directly as a lever
to ensure people actually have access to what their tax money has
already paid for -- research and knowledge.

In the public university model, one's tax money is used, without
asking first, to fund certain research and scientific progress, then
it is hidden away, inaccessible except for the privileged and the
initiated. A perfect example of this is the Human Genome Project,
which was paid for with tax money, public money, but only accessible
to a tiny minority of scientists and corporations. I have never seen a
single line of any of that, because paywalls demanded I pay 400 or
something like that for a single paper, when there were quite a few.

So tax money, hundreds of thousands of dollars of tax money, has
already paid for government grants and the research financed that way,
then as a university stupid, I pay hundreds of thousands of dollars
out of pocket, which also goes to the same research, then to access
the fruits of my money, I have to pay an additional few thousand
dollars once the research has already been completed. Are you starting
to see where I'm going with this?

The answer is the elimination of public universities and public
grants. Without public universities at all, with destroying the public
university system, professors and academia will no longer feel
entitled to my money, but would instead assume that if they did not
release it, the cash flow would dry up instantly, and he would be
without a job for the remainder of his short miserable life. "Public"
research belongs to the people, and was already paid for with public
grants. There should be no more money necessary for access to the
results of such research, nor should any student be forced to pay
again just to see a few stupid textbooks.

The public university system is a total failure. Education under the
public school system is a sick joke. This idea that anyone will be
able to talk faculty and academia into permitting more open access to
the research they have already completed is also a sick joke.

You will never talk academia into actually bothering to make education
possible, much less bother to educate anyone, by simply asking. If it
were, educators might actually, you know, educate, rather than charge
a few thousand dollars per credit hour. It's ridiculous. The entire
scientific community, because of their anti-scientific approach to
"peer review and open access," may as well not exist at all. It is
simply yet another waste of tax money that could go to useful things
like roads, bridges and tunnels. The power grid, at least here in the
United States, is 400 years out of date, and falling apart on top of
that. We have much better things to waste tax money on besides an
anti-scientific community.

One of the basic tenets of science is Data Sharing. To ensure that
science is conducted properly, should not only be accessible to other
scientists, but the public as well. What does "Nullus in Verba" do for
anyone if only a tiny population of buddies are the only ones who can
even access your one's research, much less have the means and
education to review it. This is not science. This is pseudo-science at
best, and anti-science at worst.

The only meaningful or effective way to enforce accessibility to the
public and the people is to withhold funds permanently unless public
access is not only permitted, but enforced. All publically-funded
research is for the public, not for some researcher to durp around and
play with his toys at the expense of the tax-payer. If you are running
on government tax money, you are a servant of the people, at least in
theory. To ensure that it isn't just in theory, government grants for
research and science should be abolished.

As an alternative, a specialized hybrid crowdfunding system can be
used to provide research based on how useful that research may prove
to be. This may be seen as a regression, but the old
science-by-commission system worked, and it kept researchers in check.
All other science, if it not accessibly, should be ignored and treated
like it never existed. Any research that cannot be accessed, even if
it is linked as a reference, is an invalid reference, and is
referencing a document that does not exist, and cannot be used as a
supporting argument for anything, because an argument that relies on a
research paper behind a paywall does not exist, either.

In addition to the crowdfunding system, a peer-2-peer loaning system
to fund research on credit can be used, however such a system is only
theoretical at this point, it has not been tested. The theory is
sound, however, and software projects implementing such a system are
already underway. If one can finance cars, get mortgages and business
loans via a peer-2-peer loan system, and then combine that with a
crowdfunding system, we can fund science with it, real science that
actually contributes meaningfully to society, not just a tiny minority
of scientists.

This is what happens when you centralize science to a few select
universities and associated institutions, centralize the power
associated with this knowledge to a tiny community so small everyone
knows everyone else by name and the way they write, and on top of
this, have a highly centralized government fund the entire mess. This
is what happens.

The public school and university system has completely and utterly
failed. People still think that IQ tests measure something genetic or
at least probabilistic. People still think math is hard, and that
science is bad. This is not their fault, it is your fault.

It is the fault of the scientific community that a majority of people
consider science to be irrelevant to their lives, and that it is a
complete waste of taxpayer money to fund government-controlled
educational institutions.

It is a failure on the part of the scientific community to connect
their arcana to the uninitiated. It is a failure. If scientists think
that they are entitled to their research and the money that funds it,
they are wrong in many ways, not just one. Science serves the people,
especially if it's paid with the people's money. It does not work the
other way around. The people do not serve science.

Science is not a religion, it is not a cult, it is not supposed to be
yet another tool of control and domination at the hands of the
government. So why do scientists act like it's a cult, excluding the
people who paid for it all? Is this some kind of club? No, it is not.

It behooves any scientist or researcher to keep in mind where the
money for all their shiny toys came from, and I'll give you a hint, it
isnt the government. A government by definition is funded with
pillage-money, money gained by raping, pillaging and burning, it was
that way since the dawn of civilization. It is not from any
mega-corporation, corporations are the same as the government. Any
sufficiently large organization behaves like a single organism, but it
is not, it is a group of individuals covering their own posteriors
from the crimes they commit every day against those that cannot defend
themselves.

This is reality. Regardless of the many fictions of society and the
scientific community, the truth is that many scientists and
researchers resent having to ask for money, and they think their
research should be funded with no strings attached. They forget the
purpose of science. The whole point of science is bettering the lives
of human beings, you know, those hairless apes everyone likes to make
fun of, the unwashed masses, yeah, that's where the money is coming
from, and the point of the enlightenment and the scientific method
that sprang from it is to enlighten homo sapiens.

Every researcher must keep that at the forefront of any proposed
research project. If you resent having to worry about funding your
science, kill yourself.

Message-ID: <CABOTVX-Kr6hHGxDcZ8jMo8QZ5hgrJ9CtHB7kjUngbPW01D+cAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm creating a list of people who are happy to talk about Open Access at
events. This will act both as an internal resource for us (the Open
Knowledge Foundation receive a lot of requests for speakers) and an
external/online resource for people who are looking to put on events and
don't know who to approach.

The Open Knowledge Foundation will be catalysing more events about Open
Access in the UK over the next few months, and hopefully we can do the same
around the world. Having a list of people we can approach to talk is a
great start to doing this!

A short blog post and link to the form can be found here:
http://access.okfn.org/2014/01/24/looking-for-open-access-speakers/

Please pass it on among your networks - and do sign up yourself. It commits
you to nothing right now :-)

Best wishes,
Michelle

Lens is awesome! If anyone would want to provide a superior way of reading papers and get compensated for it, licenses preventing reuse would make that more difficult.

Maybe not a great example, but one I came across the other day.

Yes.

But as always, the meta-answer is that by definition WE DON'T KNOW
what people will come up with. So let's not start out by pre-emptively
preventing them. Open up the information, and let a thousand flowers
grow.

Hi Heather,

You are completely correct in saying that something like the RightsLink
mess is not legally preventable if everything is licensed CC-BY en-masse.

But then there are 3 issues of practical importance that merit
consideration:

1/ Can we enforce our legal rights even if we chose a different license for
our scholarly works?
In short, I believe that the answer to this is "no". You're not going to
sue RightsLink on your own, because you have things which are actually
worthwhile to focus on, such as the actual work which underlies the outputs
you produce.

A group of people might be able to do it. But this requires significant
time to be sunk into organisation and even persuading others to back you.
Again, this is a problem of resources in practice.

What actually prevents businesses from doing what RightsLink is doing is
the immense reputation damage which this will cause. If they are a new
company (start-up size) in the scholarly or more narrowly, the OA sector,
they may be destroyed completely! Nobody with enough knowledge about Open
Access would invest time or money in such a high-risk, low-profit
enterprise.
Also, as this paragraph implies, I do think that RightsLink will either be
fixed or go down, once the costs of running what's almost a scam outgrow
the profit.

2/ What else did we just prevent?
We've tread on this topic enough in this tread. We don't know what
downstream restrictions might prevent, regardless of whether they're NC, ND
or even SA-style (or any other type). I don't really think that scholars
can enumerate the sensible ways (commercial and otherwise) in which their
work can be used, or that they would care to try. Research to do, papers to
write, etc.

3/ Does it matter that things like RightsLink can sell Open Access
materials for exorbitant sums of money?

No, not at all. If we, as a community of people interested in the progress
of scholarship, dislike what RightsLink are doing we shouldn't *just* point
a finger and condemn them (though that's also not bad). We should come up
with an equally good way of distributing OA articles!

* * *

We have to ask "why are they able to do this?", not "how can we stop them
from doing this?". Well, why are they able to do this? They have a big
audience. They have thousands of scholars checking pages on which
RightsLink is promoted every DAY. Money has been poured into the software
development, hosting and integration of that service with a variety of
systems that really large publishers hold. As a consequence, they can do
whatever they like!

But distributing OA articles and making them discoverable costs money and
time + big publishing houses may be quite unhelpful. Presumably RightsLink
requires quite a bit of metadata to operate. I don't think they'll hand
this over to the OA community (just yet) - yet they are doing exactly that
with RightsLink. So if we want to build this better alternative to
RightsLink, we may need even MORE resources than them, because the
publishers will be unhelpful.

Where should those resources come from? We could charge readers directly ..
for OA content .. which would be doing the same as RightsLink.
Hmmm. Not very appealing.

We could also think about taking a gradual approach:
1/ Think about what such a system will involve.
2/ Think about current sources of data and papers (Open University CORE
system, institutional repositories and lists of such repositories, the
DOAJ...).
3/ Build proof of concept tools which perform small parts of the work. E.g.
http://howopenisit.org/ is kinda like RightsLink in the sense that it tries
to tell you what the license of an article is, except that PLoS funded the
initial development and the hosting and now it's free to use, though it has
severe problems with identifying article licenses. It's getting improved
next month.

We will also need some more parts, like a catalogue, a dissemination
mechanism, a cheap hosting mechanism and quite a few other bits.

But who is going to pay for this? Not the readers. So our best bet are
organisations interested in OA. The various foundations (Mozilla has strong
open science involvement now), publishers who would like their content
distributed to more scholars for less money than it'd take them to do it,
others I haven't thought of. Maybe even universities (maybe ones that don't
have an institutional repository and don't want one right now).

So there we go, we have a commercial project which builds, maintains and
expands clean and well-made mechanisms for distributing Open Access
content. It deals with nothing but metadata and openly licensed PDF-s.

Now, I know you're not arguing for CC-BY-NC specifically. However, anything
that is not on CC-BY's level of openness ("freedom given to downstream
users") is going to create UNexpected difficulties. NC will make it legally
bad, SA may create legal compatibility problems with simple -BY articles.
If you imagine yourself as the creator of this service, you've already got
a really difficult job ahead of you. You don't want any more difficulties
than absolutely necessary! And we as a community don't *want* to place
unneeded burden on this hypothetical service builder & maintainer.

I can't speak for the OA community, but I think this kind of scenario is
closer to what Mark was going for than "let's make another RightsLink".

Business is a way to solve practical problems, how "well" a business
behaves will *ultimately* depend on the values of its creators.
Doing business with OA content is just a way of solving the severe
difficulties the OA movement has in expanding its influence and bringing
tangible benefits to society, it's not "bad" per se. The question is - is
the business bound to the profits of an established publisher, or is it
free to prioritise the needs of scholars and the public above all else?

But maybe those ideas are worthless. Maybe I'm just not imaginative +
experienced enough to be able to envisage good solutions. If that is the
case, I'd still rather that all scholarly content was licensed in a way
which did not prevent somebody better than me from having a go.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Comments:  this sounds lovely, but let's give some thought to the very real potential that the most common commercial re-use will be to set up RightsLink type of services which charge people for articles that people freely give away or paywalled educational packages. CC-BY permits such uses. 

Regarding the Lens example:
http://blog.pubchase.com/the-fake-open-access-scam/

This is a project of eLife. It's an interesting extension of publishing services, but note that publishers like Elsevier have been developing their services on a technical basis for some time without requiring CC-BY. If after 10 years' experience with CC-BY, thanks to PLoS, BioMedCentral, and Hindawi, this is the best example that people can come up with, I would argue that this presents a substantial lack of evidence for the benefits of CC-BY. 

I'm not sure who is responsible for Lens, but I do not believe that I (or any scholar) have any obligation to give the results of my work to them for their personal profit.This is in effect what CC-BY as part of a mandate policy requires. 

The argument that we don't know what might happen so let's open things up for experimentation can apply to licenses as well. If CC-BY advocates succeed in forcing everyone to use this license, we won't know what other creative and possibly better approaches to copyright / licensing for open access might emerge. This is one reason why I'm inclined to support the default OJS open access statement: "This journal provides immediate open access to its content on the principle that making research freely available to the public supports a greater global exchange of knowledge" is perhaps the best approach for the time being - but note that I wouldn't support forcing or coercing anyone to use this approach.

Hi Michelle,

The Open Access Directory (OAD) has long maintained an OA speakers bureau.
http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_speakers_bureau

Some potential speakers might not know about it and therefore might not
have signed up. But wouldn't it be better to enlarge OAD list than start a
new one?

OAD is a wiki. To prevent spam, contributions are limited to registered
users, but registration is free and easy.

CC-BY makes the RightsLink type of service far more likely by explicitly permitting commercial uses. 

As for this being a low-profit enterprise, note that scholarly publishing is a multi-billion dollar industry with some of the largest publishers bringing in 30-40% profit margins. 

Do companies pursuing profit necessarily care about the approval of scholars? Note that "e" in Elsevier has been translated as evil by many scholars and the librarians who pay the subscriptions for decades - this has had absolutely no impact on the bottom line.  The "cost of knowledge" Elsevier boycott got their attention a little (and a bit of change in the area of mathematics), but no impact on profits. Ultimately a corporation reports to its shareholders, not scholars or readers. All else being equal I'm sure they would prefer that we like them too, but when the two values are in conflict (scholar approval and maximum profit), they are legally required to prioritize profit. That's how publicly traded corporations work.

Maybe even universities (maybe ones that don't have an institutional repository and don't want one right now).

However, anything that is not on CC-BY's level of openness ("freedom given to downstream users") is going to create UNexpected difficulties.

If you imagine yourself as the creator of this service, you've already got a really difficult job ahead of you. You don't want any more difficulties than absolutely necessary!

CC-BY does not impose an obligation on a downstream user to direct customers to free versions, merely a negative obligation to not actively prevent use of free versions. Further I argue that while there are many grey areas where there is no consensus on what constitutes commercial use, the RightsLink example - selling CC-BY articles for a profit - is a clearcut, straightforward, obvious commercial use. That is, if you don't want people to take your work and sell it for a profit, don't use CC-BY.

An argument could be made that RightsLink could provide NC licensed articles, charging for their own service but not royalties for the article per se unless by arrangement with a copyright holder. Similarly if you print out an NC article you likely are paying for the paper and printing; this is not a commercial use of the article itself.

Indeed, which is why I don't think they're in a good position to be the
caretakers of a good Open Access dissemination mechanism. I do think they
should try to do better with regards to their own OA content, but can
understand why this is proving difficult for them.

We may simple need to avoid the publicly traded model for the time being. I
don't want to imply that this is the best model for the technical and
social solutions that Open Access needs. It could be a non-profit too. Or a
private company, if more suitable (then the values-of-the-creators idea
would really hold true). But we don't know which approach is best. I would
really rather keep options open than just kill any potential commercial
innovation in this area.
(A non-scholarly example: http://tosdr.org/about.html - they manage to do
useful work and get funding. They don't say what kind of legal body they
are and I suspect they may not have one, i.e. just loose collection of
individuals. It doesn't have to be more complex than that, although a
(private) LLC has some advantages in limiting personal liability.)

The fact that people could behave unethically or in a way which we don't
like does not mean all of them will. I don't want to stand in the way of
those who do try to have a wholesome approach for the best interests of
scholars AND the public. And my point is that it doesn't matter that some
*other* people will behave in a way with which we disagree.

The fact they're anti-competitive doesn't mean we should kill any chance of
competition in this field by endorsing -NC or any other downstream usage
restriction and end up in a "no person, no problem"-style situation where
we sit and congratulate each other on the successful prevention of some
activity.

There is also the issue that commercial organisations *are* part of the
public (indeed, much of our current society has been built on the back of
commercial innovation). Open scholarship means open to use by the public,
and that includes businesses - private, public, small, big, partnerships
and sole traders. This seems to be the heart of the Open Definition
principle of "does not discriminate against fields of endeavour".

It just isn't open otherwise - and not just theoretically. I do think that
in practice -NC scholarship intentionally limits its beneficial impact on
society.

"Businesses" includes even non-profits (who, albeit non-commercial on paper
or with *ultimate* non-profit goals, obviously need to "conduct business"
in their daily operations). Also I realise that non-profits may be affected
differently by -NC, but I don't think they'll be immune to its chilling
effects in practice.

One last thing - you have a more than excellent grasp of copyright,
licensing and intellectual property. But not everybody does, including
myself, and I feel that way even though I've spent about 8 years trying to
understand copyright, licensing and intellectual property law (such as the
patent system). Obviously this is not full-time, but rather I've always
tried to take a proactive learning stance as far as practically reasonable
in the course of my work.

I feel there is a rather large number of scholars and individual members of
the public who are in a similar position. We need to know "I am allowed to
do the thing I want to do by the author" without having to understand the
precise definition of "commercial" or copyright law (i.e. licensing applies
to the copy, not the intellectual property presented in the copy).
I do not feel that it's worth sacrificing this clarity of indirect
communication between millions of people (scholars and all kinds of
consumers of their outputs) for the asserted ability to potentially stop
somebody from selling scholarly outputs.

CC-BY does not need to prove its benefits. It has profoundly changed the
way humans deal with the written word for the better, especially as far as
reuse is concerned - and has eliminated the need for clarification and
requesting permission from the author, saving an incalculable (literally)
amount of effort. It has also been a band-aid for the copyright and IP
systems due to simplifying the exchange of information so much that
individuals don't have to know legal details in order to get on with their
work. I cannot say the same for -NC, -SA, -ND or any other downstream
restriction.

Emanuil

hi Emanuil,

Thank you for your kind words, and it is a good point that most people do not understand copyright (it is a contested concept, so I would argue that it is not possible to fully understand copyright - potential major changes to copyright law internationally are under discussion through the trans pacific partnership, for example.

It would be nice to make things simple for people, but not worth it if the simple solution opens up the potential for re-enclosure of the whole system as CC-BY does.  

Also please note that CC-BY is not as simple as people think. Scholars use CC-BY and are shocked when they see people selling their work, even though they have authorized this. 

Even attribution is not as simple as people think. A common argument I've heard for CC-BY is to permit blanket inclusion of CC-BY works into Wikipedia. The argument is that the CC-BY license is compatible with Wikipedia's CC-BY-SA. It is correct that the licenses are compatible, however the norm for attribution for scholarly works is to attribute the author, whereas with wikipedia the norm is to attribute Wikipedia; individual contributors are anonymous for all practical purposes.

CC-BY works invoke author moral rights. If you use rights under CC-BY that authors do not like, the author has legal recourse. It is probably not correct to state that authors always want attribution of their works. If you'd like to take my work and make a creative wordle with it, for example, I might like what you do with this (and value attribution), or dislike it and not want attribution, but not want to forbid the work as it might be very difficult to connect the derivative with the original.

When people advocate for CC-BY an example I do not see, which I would consider to be the most likely derivative in a CC-BY future, is the co-authored article, where one scholar releases an article and another decides to change it and re-publish, attributing the original author and adding their name. This to me is a paradigmatic example of a derivative, but not at all simple in practice.

Another complexity is that CC-BY works (any copyrighted work) can include third party material. Even in the simplest case (a CC-BY work included in another CC-BY work), there are two different cases for attribution. However many CC-BY works include elements of other works that are not CC-BY licensed (and not to do so would include a lot of works). There are also rights related to, but not the same as, copyright. For example, a photo in a CC-BY work may include other rights such as rights of the person(s) whose photos were taken. In addition to legal rights, with scholarly works there are also ethical considerations. If you think copyright is complicated, try reading a funding agency's ethical guidelines (the Canadian tricouncil's guidance document is about 174 pages, I believe). 

One example of how CC-BY can actually decrease rights is when people looking for simplicity use CC-BY licenses on works that are in the public domain. This is an assertion of copyright of works in the public domain. 

If we want changes in international copyright that would make all of our lives simpler (I do!) the two steps that I suggest would be difficult to achieve but have the greatest possible effect: eliminate automatic copyright (may have been a good idea with the Berne convention in 1886, but not today as a very great many works are created with copyright where the creator has no clue that this is the case) and shorten the term of copyright.

best,

Note that "e" in Elsevier has been translated as evil by many scholars and the librarians who pay the subscriptions for decades - this has had absolutely no impact on the bottom line.  The "cost of knowledge" Elsevier boycott got their attention a little (and a bit of change in the area of mathematics), but no impact on profits. Ultimately a corporation reports to its shareholders, not scholars or readers. All else being equal I'm sure they would prefer that we like them too, but when the two values are in conflict (scholar approval and maximum profit), they are legally required to prioritize profit. That's how publicly traded corporations work.

It has profoundly changed the way humans deal with the written word for the better, especially as far as reuse is concerned - and has eliminated the need for clarification and requesting permission from the author, saving an incalculable (literally) amount of effort. It has also been a band-aid for the copyright and IP systems due to simplifying the exchange of information so much that individuals don't have to know legal details in order to get on with their work. I cannot say the same for -NC, -SA, -ND or any other downstream restriction.

E.g. http://howopenisit.org/ is kinda like RightsLink in the sense that it tries to tell you what the license of an article is, except that PLoS funded the initial development and the hosting and now it's free to use, though it has severe problems with identifying article licenses.

For those of you who were not able to participate live last week, the
video recording of our SlideWiki.org webinar is now available:

http://youtu.be/r6cPQGij5Wo

As mentioned before, SlideWiki facilitates the translation of courses
through Google Translate API integration and crowdsourcing of the
required revisioning process. From my perspective the use of SlideWiki
could facilitate the creation and translation of OKF's various Open X
Books ;-)

Best,

No, it's not 'their' work. It's the taxpayers work.
How many taxpayers can you list that are shocked that their tax dollars benefit the economy?

I do sympathize with your arguments, but scholars misappropriating the work they're being paid to do is really a very weak argument against CC BY licenses and a good example for the hubris of some colleagues.

No, it's not 'their' work. It's the taxpayers work.
How many taxpayers can you list that are shocked that their tax dollars benefit the economy?

Comment:

There are some problems with your argument:

1.	If the work of scholars is not their work, but rather the taxpayers' work, then scholars have no rights to grant copyright to publishers, period, no rights to obtain patents or to work with commercial companies or universities to help them to achieve patents. I think a good argument could be made that this is how things should work, but in reality this is not how the system works now. FYI, this would be an argument AGAINST CC-BY, as CC licenses are a partial waiver of copyright, and from this perspective scholars have no copyright to grant. If you would like to advocate for this position I very much encourage you to do so!

2.	If the work of scholars is 100% paid for by taxpayers where you work and live, what an excellent model - please write about how this works! Where I come from, even at a public university the share of the budget that comes from public funding is far from 100% and tending to shrink. Universities here are funded by a combination of public funding, student tuition, endowments and other private donations. If we think that funding = copyright ownership, then a split between all of these parties would make more sense. However, copyright does not depend on who funded a work, but rather who created it. For example, would you propose that taxpayers should claim copyright? 

3.	If the base funding of universities is far less than 100% taxpayer funded, this where I live is very true of research funding as well. Currently the success rate for applicants to Canada's Social Sciences and Humanities Research Councils' main grant process is about 20%. This has led SSHRC to create a separate fund with dedicated funding for emerging scholars (who were otherwise almost entirely shut out), the Insight Development Grants. Here, my understanding is that the approval rate is about 60-65% but only about 30% of projects actually get funded (due to lack of funds). In this environment, many scholars simply don't bother to apply. What this means is that a very large percentage of research is conducted without taxpayer funding.

4.	A lot of research is conducted by students who in North America are net payers into the system, often by a substantial amount. A few lucky students receive scholarships or support for their work, and occasionally some research funding. However, overall, I would say that it is students who subsidize the system including the taxpayer, not the other way round. I would submit that this is a completely separate issue but a very important one for our society and one that should be a priority to address. 

5. 	Research often involves other parties besides funders and researchers. An argument can be made that research on First Nations groups properly belongs to them (in Canada, some of our First Nations groups do make such claims). Businesses, medical subjects, organizations that help to facilitate the research - many people participate in research projects. This illustrates an issue with the "funder copyright" scenario - if rich people are able to fund research conducted on poor people does this mean that rich people should own the results? I would argue no, that others who have contributed to works have rights as well.

Hi everyone,

I've made some careful reading of the Creative Commons terms. While the 
differences between CC-By and CC-By-SA remain somewhat fuzzy, the 
interpretation of Mike Taylor sounds quite sensible: "my understanding 
of the distinction between CC By and CC By-SA is now that the former is 
viral only with respect to COPIES of the document so licenced, whereas 
the latter is also viral with respect to derivative works."

So what can we do with a CC-By?

1. Republish the original work under a stricter license or traditional 
copyright: clearly no. That would certainly go against the /No 
additional restriction/ specification: "You may not apply legal terms or 
technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything 
the license permits."

2. Republish the original work under stricter license / copyright with 
wide modifications: probably OK. We can deduce from the absence of the 
Share Alike, that CC-By works can be redistributed under other terms 
whenever one "remix, transform, or build upon the material"

2. Republish the original work under stricter license / copyright with 
minor modifications: grey area. Minor modifications are probably not 
enough to claim a transformative use.

3. Make some data-mining with the original work: probably OK. Recent 
jurisprudence showed that data-mining is a transformative use (see the 
recent Google Books decision...)

4. Republish the original work, yet within an innovative reading frame: 
grey area. This is certainly transformative, although the original work 
remains untouched.

CC-By is, so far, not a simple license. While the legal mechanism is 
sounder than I thought (with an efficient frame to guarantee the 
preservation of the original license), it gives way to numerous greay 
areas. The easier way is clearly to state that the original work ? was ? 
in CC-By and links to the original version (which is no more complicated 
than giving the credits to the original authors).

It's actually quite close to my perspective, as I do take issue with university-applied patents and 'spin-off' companies by (public) university scholars, etc.

Thus, I try to make all my research CC0 or CC BY or public domain and argue that this is what all people in similar positions should do.

That's how it is here. The state pays my university which pays my salary, that of my technician and that of my postdoc, plus a yearly budget which (in my rather special case) covers almost my entire research budget, if the two people I mentioned remained by sole co-workers.

The model (which is slowly becoming outdated as research becomes more expensive) is that state universities cover all baseline aspects of research and teaching, while the federal government only pays for the extra-ordinary research projects for which one needs grants.

In my case, there is only public money involved, from beginning to end. Student tuitions existed here only a for a few years, went 100% into teaching and were abolished last year. Private donations happen essentially only at institutions with corporate interests such as technical universities or in fields such as economics or some such.

From an international perspective, perhaps this makes my case special, I don't know, but at least for most of Europe and the US (public universities) in my field of research, I get the impression it's at least very similar.

> For example, would you propose that taxpayers should claim copyright? 

To combat abuse by whom? Tax-evaders? Maybe :-) Aliens? I don't know if copyright should be our top priority in this case :-)

Seriously, though, I've seen the issue mentioned of tax-payers from one country protecting their investment against tax-payers from other countries. This is something that the current mantra of "the tax payer paid for it, so the tax payer should be able to access and re-use it" would, IMHO, cover. One country could, in principle, make all their research OA only for that country (more tricky in practice, obviously).

Clearly, this sort of "knowledge protectionism" is a perspective we should try and prevent.
However, I don't really have a good idea on how to defend "let's give away the research we paid for to those who didn't pay" against politicians who already begrudge poor people their social security. 

> What this means is that a very large percentage of research is conducted
> without taxpayer funding.

As with all research that is not tax payer funded, the open access rationale doesn't apply - it applies the rationale of either the scholar, if they are self-funded, or of the entity paying the scholar.

I don't think anybody ever proposed making something public by default which wasn't public to begin with?

I don't think issues such as these are relevant for this discussion, as human rights always trump *any* form of license or copyright (at least for me as a non-lawyer), i.e., whatever license were ever established as a "default", there would always be larger reasons (e.g., privacy, your examples, or biological safety, etc.) which necessitate exceptions.

For instance, I'm not sure I would favor a CC BY license for a paper which happened to describe the construction of an H-bomb with household ingredients, but I wouldn't find this particular example an obstacle to OA in general.

All the best,

Bjoern

attention to a debate
<http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/12/24/pubmed-central-revealed-revie
wing-and-interpreting-the-findings-of-a-surprising-2013/>  I had with Kent
Anderson at the Scholarly Kitchen (see towards the end of the comments) - he
feels very strongly that American taxpayers should not be paying for other
countries to have access to research (specifically through PMC in this
case).  I have come up against this kind of thinking from traditional
publishers again and again.

Actually, Kent Anderson feels very strongly that he should be allowed
to keep printing money by paywalling the work of others. Everything
else he says follows from that.

hi Bjoern,

First I'll return to what I am interpreting as your argument that taxpayer funding means that articles must be published CC-BY. Then I will explain that if you have the good fortune to enjoy 100% public funding, this is a good thing but not ubiquitous.

Funding agencies do have the rights to attach conditions when they supply funding. However, this does not mean that funding agencies always have the legal right to insist that funded articles be published CC-BY. Here are some examples of when this will not be the case:

1. If an article includes third party works, whether this portion of the work can be released under a CC-BY license is within the legal rights of the third party, not the scholar or their funder. If a scholar publishes an article with the CC-BY license they may be violating the rights of a third party. It is quite possible that this will happen without the scholar realizing that this is the case, because not many people understand these nuances of copyright.

2. A lot of scholarly research involves human subjects, who have rights under the ethical guidelines of funding agencies. There are many potential circumstances where informed consent would not provide rights to grant blanket permission for derivatives and/or commercial use of portions of works (above and beyond copyright as these may also be third party works). For example, if you include a picture of a research subject in an article, you do not have the right to grant anyone in the world permission to alter the picture and/or use it for commercial purposes unless you have explicitly stated in the process of obtaining consent that the picture will be used for this purpose. I have doubts that scholars or research ethics committees (or anyone, for that matter) has sufficient knowledge of the potential consequences to explain them in order to gain informed consent.

Another reason why I think scholars and funding agencies alike should hesitate before demanding CC-BY is the potential for derivatives to cause harm through the spread of misinformation. My understanding of the study of toxicology is that a common saying, for good reason, is that the difference between a drug and a poison is a dose. Unleashing the creativity involved with automated derivatives may have benefits, but if a doctor is relying on a derivative that inserted a zero in the wrong place, the result could be death. Note that I am not demanding that derivatives be forbidden, rather suggesting that there are substantive reasons for hesitation about requiring that all scholarly works permit derivatives on a blanket basis.

Now to explain just how fortunate Bjoern and others in his situation are:

If your university and research are 100% publicly funded, then I would suggest that this is a special case. I would argue that this should be the norm - I favour fully publicly funded higher education. However, in much of the world this is not the case.

Some reading:

Denhart, Chris. Forbes July 2013: how the $1.2 trillion college debt crisis is crippling students, parents and the economy:
http://www.forbes.com/sites/specialfeatures/2013/08/07/how-the-college-debt-is-crippling-students-parents-and-the-economy/

Freeman, Sunny, July 2013 Huffington Post Canada: Student Debt Canada: Post-Grads Delay Adult Life, Struggle with Payments, TD says:
http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/07/24/student-debt-canada-_n_3646153.html

TD is Toronto Dominion, a very conservative Canadian bank. This is Forbes and TD explaining that student debt is a huge issue.

In Canada and the US student debt is non-forgivable; it cannot be discharged in bankruptcy, no matter what. I argue that we are in effect asking the next generation to take on this burden to "invest" in their education then sign off on trade deals that have the effect of eliminating a large portion of the high-paying jobs for which they were investing. This is why I suggest that students, at least in North America, are in effect subsidizing both universities and taxpayers. For example, in the case of research, there are many grad students taking on a huge debt load some will never recover from in order to do research in the public interest.

North America is not unique, however. For example, see this article from the Guardian on the desperate situation of universities in Greece:

Smith, Helena, September 25, 2013. Austerity measures push Greek universities to point of collapse.
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/25/austerity-measures-push-greek-universities-collapse

Meanwhile, in the UK:

Malik, Shiv. November 25, 2013. The Guardian. Poorest students face ?350m cut in grants.
http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/nov/22/poorest-students-face-350m-cuts

The cuts to student funding in the UK are particularly troubling to me in the context of UK's publisher-friendly open access policy. It strikes me that the UK is more concerned with the health of publisher profits than the prospects of the UK's own next generation.

Taxpayer access is a strong argument for open access but subject to this particular counter-argument.

To counter the counter-arguments it is important to speak to the indirect as well as the direct benefits of open access to taxpayer research. Direct benefits are when the taxpayer can read the results of the research themselves (subject to nationalist arguments).

Indirect benefits include advancing the research. Examples:

If a foreign researcher can contribute towards the cure or treatment for cancer we're supporting through our tax dollars, this gets us to our goal faster (speeds the research) and is financially beneficial (others contribute to pay for what we want).

If another country is able to stop a communicable disease within their borders because we have shared our knowledge with them, they benefit, but so do we - this lowers the odds that we will have to deal with the disease.

If anyone, anywhere, can figure how ways to achieve cheap, clean energy sources, and shares their knowledge with all, everyone benefits.

best,

FYI, this would be an argument AGAINST CC-BY, as CC licenses are a

partial waiver of copyright, and from this perspective scholars have

no copyright to grant. If you would like to advocate for this position

I very much encourage you to do so!

It's actually quite close to my perspective, as I do take issue with
university-applied patents and 'spin-off' companies by (public) university
scholars, etc.

Thus, I try to make all my research CC0 or CC BY or public domain and argue
that this is what all people in similar positions should do.

2.      If the work of scholars is 100% paid for by

taxpayers where you work and live, what an excellent model

- please write about how this works!

That's how it is here. The state pays my university which pays my salary,
that of my technician and that of my postdoc, plus a yearly budget which (in
my rather special case) covers almost my entire research budget, if the two
people I mentioned remained by sole co-workers.

The model (which is slowly becoming outdated as research becomes more
expensive) is that state universities cover all baseline aspects of research
and teaching, while the federal government only pays for the extra-ordinary
research projects for which one needs grants.

In my case, there is only public money involved, from beginning to end.
Student tuitions existed here only a for a few years, went 100% into
teaching and were abolished last year. Private donations happen essentially
only at institutions with corporate interests such as technical universities
or in fields such as economics or some such.

>From an international perspective, perhaps this makes my case special, I
don't know, but at least for most of Europe and the US (public universities)
in my field of research, I get the impression it's at least very similar.

For example, would you propose that taxpayers should claim copyright?

To combat abuse by whom? Tax-evaders? Maybe :-) Aliens? I don't know if
copyright should be our top priority in this case :-)

Seriously, though, I've seen the issue mentioned of tax-payers from one
country protecting their investment against tax-payers from other countries.
This is something that the current mantra of "the tax payer paid for it, so
the tax payer should be able to access and re-use it" would, IMHO, cover.
One country could, in principle, make all their research OA only for that
country (more tricky in practice, obviously).

Clearly, this sort of "knowledge protectionism" is a perspective we should
try and prevent.

However, I don't really have a good idea on how to defend "let's give away
the research we paid for to those who didn't pay" against politicians who
already begrudge poor people their social security.

What this means is that a very large percentage of research is

conducted without taxpayer funding.

As with all research that is not tax payer funded, the open access rationale
doesn't apply - it applies the rationale of either the scholar, if they are
self-funded, or of the entity paying the scholar.

I don't think anybody ever proposed making something public by default which
wasn't public to begin with?

5.      Research often involves other parties besides

funders and researchers. An argument can be made that research on

First Nations groups properly belongs to them (in Canada, some of our

First Nations groups do make such claims). Businesses, medical

subjects, organizations that help to facilitate the research - many

people participate in research projects. This illustrates an issue

with the "funder copyright" scenario - if rich people are able to fund

research conducted on poor people does this mean that rich people

should own the results? I would argue no, that others who have

contributed to works have rights as well.

I don't think issues such as these are relevant for this discussion, as
human rights always trump *any* form of license or copyright (at least for
me as a non-lawyer), i.e., whatever license were ever established as a
"default", there would always be larger reasons (e.g., privacy, your
examples, or biological safety, etc.) which necessitate exceptions.

For instance, I'm not sure I would favor a CC BY license for a paper which
happened to describe the construction of an H-bomb with household
ingredients, but I wouldn't find this particular example an obstacle to OA
in general.

All the best,

Bjoern

I can't let this particular piece of misinformation slip by. Just as well I
have access to this discussion so that I, and others, may correct you.

Your argument here has absolutely nothing to do with cc-by, and everything
to do with quality of research and the ability to assess and correct it and
to make it appropriate for consumption by particular user communities.

You can tell by the fact that your example postulates an incorrect cc-by
derivative and implies it is comparable to a non-cc-by but correct
derivative. Thus you implicitly assume, and obfuscate from your reader the
option to independently judge, that all non-cc-by works can somehow be
taken to be correct by virtue of their license condition.

However I could already take a piece of your work, regardless of license
condition (and I could pay to access it if necessary), and write my own
work with reference to and reliance upon yours. But my own work could be
quality, or terrible, or purposeful fraud. I could succeed in publishing my
new work under any form of copyright I desire, and in a highly reputable
and expensive journal.

My point being, you can spread misinformation as much as you like,
regardless of copy rights.

So the choice is, would you rather make it easier or harder for others to
access and independently verify your claims?

I would further argue that if particular forms of copy right are capable of
imbuing quality as your argument suggests, despite the fact that nowhere do
the definitions of any form of copy right make guarantees as to the quality
of works to which they are attached, then the very concept of copy right is
inappropriate for application to scholarly works.

hi Mark,

The point with respect to the potential for incorrect derivatives has to do with derivatives per se rather than how the derivatives are licensed. Any license that permits derivatives could just as easily permit incorrect derivatives as correct ones. My point is that there are valid scholarly reasons for hesitation about granting blanket permission to create derivatives.

best,

Heather Morrison

Heather, with all due respect this is complete nonsense. Whether I
licence my work as CC By, CC By-NC or All Rights Reserved, people are
free to write papers that use my work incorrectly, misquote me, or
otherwise get it wrong. To avoid doing that is the stuff of academic
work. It's completely irrelevant to licencing.

Mike,

Of course people can misquote an author's work regardless of licensing! What the CC licenses granting blanket permission for derivatives does is to pre-authorize derivatives.

In the case of a wrongful death because of an incorrect derivative regarding a drug dose, in addition to the death there can be differences in legal liability for the research funder based on whether they did or did not require the use of derivatives.

Since you're obviously in favour of derivatives, allow me to flatter you by creating a derivative of your words.

The actually respectful derivative:  ""Heather, with all due respect I disagree". (attribution: Mike Taylor, good manners contributed by Heather Morrison).

You are welcome! Thanks to you as always for contributing to the discussion.

hi Mark,

The point with respect to the potential for incorrect derivatives has to do
with derivatives per se rather than how the derivatives are licensed. Any
license that permits derivatives could just as easily permit incorrect
derivatives as correct ones. My point is that there are valid scholarly
reasons for hesitation about granting blanket permission to create
derivatives.

Your argument here has absolutely nothing to do with cc-by, and everything
to do with quality of research and the ability to assess and correct it and
to make it appropriate for consumption by particular user communities.

You can tell by the fact that your example postulates an incorrect cc-by
derivative and implies it is comparable to a non-cc-by but correct
derivative. Thus you implicitly assume, and obfuscate from your reader the
option to independently judge, that all non-cc-by works can somehow be taken
to be correct by virtue of their license condition.

However I could already take a piece of your work, regardless of license
condition (and I could pay to access it if necessary), and write my own work
with reference to and reliance upon yours. But my own work could be quality,
or terrible, or purposeful fraud. I could succeed in publishing my new work
under any form of copyright I desire, and in a highly reputable and
expensive journal.

My point being, you can spread misinformation as much as you like,
regardless of copy rights.

So the choice is, would you rather make it easier or harder for others to
access and independently verify your claims?

I would further argue that if particular forms of copy right are capable of
imbuing quality as your argument suggests, despite the fact that nowhere do
the definitions of any form of copy right make guarantees as to the quality
of works to which they are attached, then the very concept of copy right is
inappropriate for application to scholarly works.

Now to explain just how fortunate Bjoern and others in his situation are:

If your university and research are 100% publicly funded, then I would
suggest that this is a special case. I would argue that this should be the
norm - I favour fully publicly funded higher education. However, in much of
the world this is not the case.

The cuts to student funding in the UK are particularly troubling to me in
the context of UK's publisher-friendly open access policy. It strikes me
that the UK is more concerned with the health of publisher profits than the
prospects of the UK's own next generation.

There will always be reasons for people to *worry*. This is completely
disconnected from reality though. I may worry about a lot of things which
will never happen, but I try to deal with reality in such a way that my
worries don't get in the way of others.

It just becomes a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
Somebody could print my paper and cause arson using the copy as kindling,
so let's license the copy under My Own License Attribution NoArson and make
indirect communication between millions of people (== licensing) more
difficult. Adding support for that license to the various systems which
deal with scholarship does cost *real* resources, others may not understand
if NoArson is compatible with other conditions in other licenses and it
just contributes to the chaos. I literally did nothing useful and managed
to make other people's lives more difficult for no good reason.

And scholars are free to do this, a right that I do support. They can
publish it under NoArson themselves on their own web page or anywhere they
can get it to. But they certainly can't expect the maintainers of widely
used systems like repositories, aggregators and so many others, to spend
resources on supporting this particular restriction.

If CC-BY works, then just use it. Doing otherwise has a direct negative
impact on the whole of the scholarly world. Forget any hypothetical
problems. When real problems arise, deal with them by actually talking to
the parties involved and starting discussions like this one. Any kind of
restrictive licensing will very, very, very rarely help you and will make
everybody's life more difficult, including yours, ALL the time. So the vast
majority of the time there's just no point in using anything else other
than CC-BY, worried or not.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Comment: this is a bit of a stretch. Scholarship has been happening for a very long time, while Creative Commons has only been around for about 10 years and is currently used for a minority of scholarly works produced at present (a smaller minority if only CC-BY works are counted).

Note that you did not take the time to CC license your e-mail. This means that it falls under automatic copyright under the Berne Convention. Your words are All Rights Reserved. Can you explain how this has "a direct negative impact on the whole of the scholarly world"?

I submit that this is a bit of a stretch.

Perfect! If this is this an example of why we should NOT have CC BY, it's not working.

Thanks Andrew,

I completely concur with your concern.

In my view this is close to breaking Trade Description Acts. If someone
pays for a service they should get it clearly labelled. I have blogged
about this repeatedly - with "OA" papers covered with All rights reserved,
links to RightsLink, etc.

There are legal, ethical and moral duties on publishers. We might have
hoped that in scholarly publishing companies accepted all these as
compelling. Certainly if a scholarly society fails to honour its OA
commitment they are break all three. If a for-profit breaks it then it is a
sad day for the industry. Unfortunately every week is full of sad days.

If we are really fighting the publishing industry some of whom are trying
to take advantage of our goodwill and reluctance to chase this up, then we
need regulation. Regulation that says - you guaranteed to make this Open
Access - there are basic *trading* standards you must adhere to. If it's OA
it must be labelled as such and misleading labels and links should be
removed. Otherwise it's no different from cheap shops offering "free"
products with hidden strings.

IMO the failure to honour the OA contract by mislabelling is far more
serious than "predatory OA publishers"

Indeed. And now I am free to compare the two, and decide if Heather was
correct to imply that Mike was disrespectful, or if she misrepresented him.

Although, did Heather just infringe Mikes reserved rights?

hi Mark,

Under automatic copyright a copyright holder has the exclusive right to authorize derivatives. Mike's e-mail to the list falls under copyright, so yes, you could make the argument that I have infringed his rights (both the exclusive right to authorize derivatives and possibly his moral rights). On the other hand, an argument can be made that this use is perfectly legitimate under fair use / fair dealing as quotation for the purpose of criticism.

The situation would be similar with this quotation, a derivative of Bjoern's words copied below:

Brembs, B. on "Mike Taylor words with Heather Morrison's good manners": "This is a perfect example of why we should NOT have CC-BY. It's not working!"

My purpose in creating and sharing this example is scholarly criticism. I understand that my example does not reflect the meaning Brembs intended. However, if people are using CC licenses to grant blanket rights to create derivatives of their works to anyone, anywhere, it is possible that people creating adaptations may think they understand the words of the original author but the original author might not agree with their interpretation. I am using this illustration to explain why not every scholar is keen to grant blanket permission to anyone, anywhere to create derivatives of their work.

When discussing open access policy with respect to derivatives, it may be helpful to realize that "derivative" is not the same as "good, useful derivative". A derivative work can be an improvement, benign, or harmful. Either improvements or harms can be negligible or significant.

If some scholars and publishers wish to experiment with blanket derivatives, that's their right. What I object to is policy requiring everyone to participate in the experiment.

best,

Heather MOrrison

Indeed. And now I am free to compare the two, and decide if Heather was correct to imply that Mike was disrespectful, or if she misrepresented him.

Although, did Heather just infringe Mikes reserved rights?

Well, Heather, there may be an interesting distinction there in how your
derivative is incorrect.

Under CC-BY, if you've modified the work (such as inserting a zero), then
you are required to state that the work has been modified (and even
indicate how). Failure to do so would be a breach of the license.

Furthermore, creating a derivative from a trusted source does not magically
imbue the derivative with trustworthiness. Nobody should ever be trusting a
derivative more than the level of review and checking that the derivative
itself has received.

And in the case of not pre-authorized derivatives, how many derivatives are
authorized based on checking the content of the derivative? In many cases,
it will simply be a purchased right, for a fee.

I have to agree with Mark. The biggest danger with misquoting /
misrepresenting work does not come from pre-authorizing derivatives, it
comes from not being able to check the original source. Whilst that does
not specifically require CC-BY, it does need a minimum of free distribution
and reading. And as that needs to be at least by the time a derivative
appears, it needs / might as well be immediate, and CC-BY,

G

I have no idea in what way this is different from all the misquoting of TA, copyrighted material that goes on all the time, i.e., why this would get worse with CC-BY as opposed to NC or ND? Do ND licenses prevent quoting? That would make them completely useless as scholarly licenses. Conversely, if you allow quoting, you allow misquoting. Surely, your aim is not to prevent quoting?

Can you explain how one license prevents misquoting (or quote-mining), compared to another license? Specifically, if I had licensed my email ND, would you be in violation of said license?
If so, if my ND licensed work ever gets misquoted or otherwise misrepresented, by accident or intent, do I get to sue the person quoting or citing me?

Then I would really consider licensing my most difficult to understand work ND and wait for the money to flow :-)

Confusedly,

Bjoern

I've been following this discussion with increasing bemusement. Frankly, it's getting ridiculous, at least in my humble opinion. A discussion such as this one about licensing and copyright only serves to demonstrate that copyright, once conceived as a way to stimulate and enable science and the arts, has degenerated into a way to frustrate, derange and debilitate knowledge exchange.

I'm not the first one to point out that absolutely anything, under any copyright licence or none, could be abused for evil purposes or, in more mild circumstances, lead to misunderstandings and accidental abuse. I agree with all those who said it.

The issue here is what science and scientific results stand for. Their purpose is emphatically not "to be copyrightable items". Copyright, invented to combat commercial abuse, has become a means of commercial abuse. The purpose of science and scientific results is to enrich the world's knowledge. Any commercial advantage ? appropriate for industrially funded research ? can be had by 1) keeping results secret (i.e. not publishing them), or 2) getting a patent. Science, particularly modern science, is nothing without a liberal exchange of ideas and information.  

Ideally, scientific publications are not copyrightable at all, and community standards take care of proper acknowledgement. We don't live in an ideal world, so we have to get as close as we can to that ideal, and that is by ameliorating the insidious pernicious effects of copyright with CC-Zero and CC-BY licences.

The existence of the NC rider or stipulation for CC licences is unfortunate and quite damaging. Mainly because of the vagueness and ambiguity of what 'commercial use' means. Ideas in published articles can be freely used for commercial purposes of any kind, as ideas are not copyrightable. Only "the way the ideas have been formulated" is covered by copyright, and thus by the NC clause in copyright licences. In my interpretation that means that most usage of published material that is not a straightforward selling of text or images can be freely done. But that's my interpretation. And that's exactly where it rubs, because all the NC clause does is introduce hypothetical difficulties and liabilities. As a result of which, NC practically means: "stay away from using this material, because you never know with all those predatory legal eagles around". In other words, it's virtually useless for modern, sophisticated scientific knowledge discovery, which doesn't just consist of reading papers any longer, but increasingly relies on the ability to machine-process large amounts of relevant information, as human ocular reading of even a fraction of the information is not possible anymore. At least not in most fast-moving areas of the sciences. Read this article, or similar ones, if you want to be convinced: "On the impossibility of being expert"  BMJ 2010; 341 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c6815 (Published 14 December 2010 ? unfortunately behind a paywall).

The taxpayer angle ("must be open because the taxpayer paid for it"), leading to Kent Andersonian notions of knowledge protectionism ("results of research paid by US taxpayers should not be available to non-US citizens unless they pay for it"), is a most unfortunate, visceral and primitive reaction and a complete red herring. For many reasons, not least because the taxpayer, or vicariously the taxman, isn't the party that pockets any money payed for paywalled information. Besides, how far do you go? Americans not being allowed to stay alive due to a cure that was developed with public money in Switzerland unless they pay through the nose for it to the Swiss tax authorities? The "as-long-as-I-am-well-the-rest-of-you-can-go-to-hell" personality disorder. The whole idea is so against the ethos of science that those even thinking in that direction must be taken to be utterly and entirely unsuitable to any role in the scientific community. 

Access control and restriction via copyright was at best a necessary evil in the print era; the 'necessary', though, has disappeared in the web environment.

Have a nice day!

Mike's e-mail to the list falls under copyright, so yes, you could make the argument that I have infringed his rights (both the exclusive right to authorize derivatives and possibly his moral rights). On the other hand, an argument can be made that this use is perfectly legitimate under fair use / fair dealing as quotation for the purpose of criticism.

However, if people are using CC licenses to grant blanket rights to create derivatives of their works to anyone, anywhere, it is possible that people creating adaptations may think they understand the words of the original author but the original author might not agree with their interpretation. I am using this illustration to explain why not every scholar is keen to grant blanket permission to anyone, anywhere to create derivatives of their work.

for Bjoern and Graham:

No license can prevent misquotes, granted. Two things that are different about CC licenses permitting derivatives:

1. Proactive encouragement of creation of derivatives (otherwise why use these licenses?). If these licenses have any effect at all, they will result in the creation of more derivatives. It seems logical that this will increase the likelihood of both positive and negative derivatives; this means greater potential for misquotes.

2. If I do not license my work in a way that explicitly permits downstream derivatives and someone misquotes me, it is clearly their fault. However, if I have explicitly permitted derivatives, an argument can be made that subsequent misquotes are to some extent my fault.

For this reason, I argue that if scholars perceive greater risks than potential benefits from allowing derivatives, they should not be required to use CC derivative licenses.

best,

I have no idea in what way this is different from all the misquoting of TA, copyrighted material that goes on all the time, i.e., why this would get worse with CC-BY as opposed to NC or ND? Do ND licenses prevent quoting? That would make them completely useless as scholarly licenses. Conversely, if you allow quoting, you allow misquoting. Surely, your aim is not to prevent quoting?

Can you explain how one license prevents misquoting (or quote-mining), compared to another license? Specifically, if I had licensed my email ND, would you be in violation of said license?
If so, if my ND licensed work ever gets misquoted or otherwise misrepresented, by accident or intent, do I get to sue the person quoting or citing me?

Then I would really consider licensing my most difficult to understand work ND and wait for the money to flow :-)

Confusedly,

Bjoern

Hi all,
I've just read the "Open Access Metadata and Indicators" document,
and I find it very useful.
A URL for the license and a Y/N free-to-read tag can go a long way in
conveying the information we want to.
For what is worth, I find it a clever, low profile approach that could be
very effective (and don't scare publishers).

Now, how should I implement it?
I see that the document recommends to put the tags in the HTML META tags
for the moment,
and hopes for standards (ONIX, OAI-PMH, RDF, DC, ..) to incorporate the new
elements.
So, we have to wait them to accept the new tags?

Cheers

it happens all the time, I've recently had this situation with an Informa paper where we've paid them the money but there is no indication anywhere on the paper or in the html that its open, and it becomes an extra thing to chase up and these are only the papers that I have come across, I'm sure there are many more that should have the information displayed correctly

Although the first port of call is usually an Elsevier website. As there may be other routes in to RightsLink, it would be good to fix that - however Elsevier really haven't got an excuse for not making the rights of an Open Access article clear on their own website and not routing through to RightsLink in the first place.

The proactive encouragement of positive derivatives would seem to be a good
thing.

As for negative derivatives, it still comes back to:

1) Any derivative that does not note that it is a derivative, and does not
note changes (which might be negative) is breaking the terms of the CC-BY
license.

2) Any derivative should also be subject to peer / editorial review in
publication. Allowing a negative derivative at that point would be a fault
of review (not of the original or derivative author).

3) If you trust a known derivative without knowing that it has been
checked, and without checking the source yourself, then that is a fault of
the reader.

You gave an example of "what if the wrong dosage is stated". Well, there
are far more problems that are created in health care by non- or restricted
disclosure of information than could ever be caused by "harmful"
derivatives.

Doctors know how to read literature. What they don't always have is access
to the literature, or effective ways to search it. It can easily be argued
that failing to require CC-BY is leading to more wrongful deaths than
incorrect derivatives which can be checked, rejected and refuted ever could.

And I argue that scholar perception has nothing to do with it. If you are
funding the research, then you have every right to expect that the scholar
publishes in a certain way (e.g. deposit in a repository). And if you are
funding the publication (that is, you are paying the APC) then you have
every right to demand a license that maximizes the value of that
publication.

Nobody is going to continue to demand CC-BY licenses if the risks do
outweigh the benefits. But we can't be paralyzed by inactivity - there are
over 700,000 articles in the Open Access subset of PubMed Central alone,
accumulated over almost 15 years. Has there been any discernible harm from
incorrect derivatives caused by this yet?

I completely agree with all that Jan Velterop said..
copyright has nothing to do in the scientific enterprise today
The benefits of having all information accessible without any restrictions,
and re-usable, the same, are enormous.
When we look at knowledge as something we have to protect, you have to ask
protect from what? From risking the chance that your work is improved by
being licensed under CC-BY?
If I remember correctly Mike Taylor at Berlin11 argued that many more
billions of dollars are in fact wasted by not being able to share
information to the full extent, than can be earned by protecting pieces of
info in order to be able to sell them.
I also particularly oppose the notion of protecting the taxpayers property
in one country from being used freely by citizens in other countries. The
idea of open access restricted to one country is non-sense. How
shortsighted can you be? People playing with these ideas probably
implicitly suppose that their country will produce all (the good science).
The problem with any licenses is that they can be abused and that people
can and will find ways to serve their own interests best. But as said
somewhere in this thread that is not the problem of the licensing, but more
of quality assurance in science.
Having open access CC-BY fully unrestricted , reusable etc in itself
however is not enough to speed up and improve science to the extent
possible, we do need networks (of scientist, citizen scientists) and ways
to access the open access information more easily and efficiently.
for this a service like described by Mark MacGillivray would be great value
and in my view even indispensable As well as the fact that we urgently need
a better framework for quality assurance in science..

Exactly. The problem we face is that accountants can calculate the
money that's to be made by hiding information, but the enormous
benefits of NOT hiding it are much harder to estimate (and, really,
impossible to know). The cost to worry about in academic publishing is
not subscriptions, page-charges or APC. It's the incredible
opportunity cost of NOT freeing our research.

I don't think anyone really supports this notion. It's a bit of a
straw-horse that people sometimes throw in for rhetorical purposes.
Even Kent Anderson can't actually believe that's a good way to go
(even if it was possible, which it's not).

Message-ID: <CAFxzj8S1ZXi-agSPJqGd79NE9+SbcBZm1tMCiwH=L1y-i7B1cw@mail.gmail.com>

I have a particularly relevant example for the members of these lists, in
regard to the topic this thread has now focused on.

We have seen in this discussion various points of view about whether or not
copyright of various (or any) sorts is good or bad for scholarship.

We have even seen questions arise as to the use of the content of the
emails on this thread as sources to quote or derive from.

And we have seen disagreement on whether or not copyright restrictions
harms scholarship.


So here is a concrete example:

My current research is about how people access and share information to
make decisions. As part of this research, I have taken the public archives
of these mailing lists and analysed the interactions between list members,
and I would like to publish these analyses in my research. What this means
is that the interactions I wish to observe in order to perform my
scholarship are interactions that - because of the definition of
intellectual property and copyright laws - have been polluted with rights
restrictions without the consent of those involved, despite the fact that I
can observe these interactions in a public forum and in a public archive
with no access restrictions and with no statement of restrictions of any
kind.

It therefore seems not only that the output of my research can be placed
under restrictions without my consent, but also that the observable events
upon which I wish to perform my scholarship can be placed under
restrictions with or without consent.


And here are two questions about what I should therefore do next:

If I were to publish my research, including the names of the people
involved in the discussions I analysed, would I be breaking the law? If so,
need I ask for consent from everyone exposed in the research - despite the
fact that they are already observably exposed by having voluntarily
contributed to a publicly archived mailing list? If so, why is it that
their comments made on a public mailing list using public identifiers and
archived in public were put under copyright restriction in the first place?

Secondly, if I were to publish my research but remove all identifying
features of the data, would I still need to ask for consent, or am I then
just performing an analysis of observable events without making use of the
reserved content of those events?


Finally, the key questions:

Is it right that our intellectual property and copyright frameworks should
make it possible for people to own the observable events upon which our
scholarship must be founded? Does it seem like a good idea, particularly
when so much of the interesting interactions between human beings is now
taking place in mediums that provide an opportunity to observe and learn
far more than we ever have done before, that those same mediums should be
the ones to carry such a polluting effect upon the observations we can make?

Regardless of any right that any of us have to protect our works, is that
right greater than the right of other scholars to make clear, accurate,
comprehensive observations? Should we be free to restrict our works and
still claim that we are scholars?

Could it be the case that intellectual property and copyright laws - in
their concept, rather than particular formulations of them - are (now)
fundamentally incompatible with scholarship?


Please note that these are not questions about privacy or making
observations into purposefully hidden events. I am talking here only of
observations that are occurring in a public arena, of people performing
public actions, without making any effort to hide their identities. Privacy
concerns may arguably override any right to make observations, but here I
am interested specifically in the cases where such observations are public.

I would greatly appreciate answers to these questions, along with a
statement explicitly placing such answers in the public domain so that I
may publish my observations and analysis of them in my research findings.

Society of Biblical Literature releases (restrictive) Green Open Access Policy
http://oaopenaccess.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/society-of-biblical-literature-releases-restrictive-green-open-access-policy/
 
Founded in 1880, the Society of Biblical Literature is the oldest and largest learned society devoted to the critical investigation of the Bible from a variety of academic disciplines. As an international organization [of over 8,500 members], the Society offers its members opportunities for mutual support, intellectual growth, and professional development (from the website).
 
The Society of Biblical Literature is publisher of the flagship Journal of Biblical Literature (begun in 1881) and numerous respected monograph series in biblical studies and cognate disciplines. On Friday, January 24, members received an email notifying them that ?through the careful review of the Research and Publications Committee, [the SBL] has developed a Green Open Access Policy for authors who contribute to the SBL publishing program.? The full (two page) policy document is available here (PDF).

But in the wider context, I would not advocate changing the default nature
of copyright protection. I might have a few things to say about how long
you are allowed to assert copyright for, but that's another matter.

For science, having copyright protection is not a bad thing - it's what you
do with it that counts.

Without *any* restriction? That's quite a large brush stroke. I would
certainly advocate that any reasonable use / re-use of a publication should
be permitted, without question or payment. But there are plenty of
unreasonable uses too - not recognizing the original work, not alerting
users to modifications of the work, etc.

You could place the work directly into the public domain, but that may
leave it open to additional risks, with few additional benefits over a
permissive license like CC-BY.

Copyright can still be an important protection, even when you are
permissively licensing the use and re-use of the content in all reasonable
ways.

This is intended to be a summary post - this is a good discussion but I'd rather it didn't get too repetitive and I respect that some of my colleagues will continue to remain firmly convinced that open access needs CC-BY regardless of what I say. 

Many of these arguments made by these colleagues are exactly the same arguments that I have made as an open access advocate over the years: free access to everyone, minimal or no copyright restrictions, taxpayer access, OA is good for business as well as the public / social good. However, I remain firmly opposed to equating open access with the CC-BY license, because:

1.	The resemblance between CC-BY and the BOAI definition is superficial in nature. It is particularly important for open access advocates to be aware that CC licenses, including CC-BY, do not mean that works must be made available free of charge. CC-BY policy has a huge, potentially systemic loophole: the possibility of re-enclosure. What is given freely today with a CC-BY license could easily be available solely through sale from Elsevier or services like RightsLink down the road. 

2.	Attempting to force CC-BY through policy results in further loopholes, for example through creative twists on licensing such as the CC-BY / exclusive license to publish of Elsevier and the Royal Society.

3.	There are downsides to permitting commercial re-use that could result in a backlash by researchers. The more that researchers equate OA with CC-BY, the greater the probability that the backlash will be against OA rather than against CC-BY. Recent concerns expressed by scholars about people selling works they have licensed CC-BY should be taken as a reason for caution. While there are many grey areas, people granting blanket commercial rights to their works should be aware (or made aware by publishers or funders requiring this license) that the most obvious commercial use of a copyrighted work is selling the work per se.

4.	After ten years of use of CC-BY licenses by a number of authors and publishers, there is as yet no clear example illustrating such a compelling use of derivatives as to require all scholars to grant derivative rights on a blanket basis.

5.	There are valid scholarly reasons for hesitating to grant derivative rights, such as the potential for incorrect or harmful derivatives. This is a good reason for tolerance, to allow scholars to decide whether the risks of allowing derivatives justify potential benefits. 

6.	The UK BIS committee examined this issue and suggested that more research is needed on the question of licensing.

Conclusion: open access overlaps but does not exactly match Creative Commons licenses. There are pro-open-access arguments and pro-scholarship arguments against attempting to force CC licenses as a default for open access. I do not expect everyone, or even anyone, to agree with my perspective on this matter. What I am hoping is that as many open access advocates as possible will appreciate that there are diverse views on the topic within the OA community itself. It is possible to be an open access activist but opposed to attempts to force CC-BY as default for OA.

I am delighted by the breadth of contributors and the intensity of the
discussion. This is not only helping to clarify ideas but also working
towards concrete action. The OKF works to make knowledge open and to make
it useful.

I'm very interested in estimating the cost of research and the cost of not
sharing it. I don't think there are any solid figures, but I'd like to work
with the following:

The human genome cost ca 4 billion USD (spent globally  US, Europe ...) and
yielded ca 800 Billion USD downstream (Battelle's analysis,
http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/BattelleReport2011.pdf).
That was in considerable part due to the Bermuda principles where all
data were published Openly and immediately. The data were also annotatable
by anyone. Genomes are vastly more valuable when annotated (== derivative
data)

It is difficult to argue hypotheticals but if the knowledge had been
restricted either in scope or speed then the effect would have been much.

The bioscience community has largely not needed licences - it operates
primarily on "community norms" - a set of explicit or implicit principles
where appropriate behaviour is encouraged and non-cooperative behaviour may
result in community reaction - anything from public criticism to
non-refunding of grants. Licences are legal documents and legal action is
almost unknown in this area - thankfully.

The reason that licences are necessary in scholarly articles is that the
primary method of revenue generation for some companies and organisations
is by *restricting* access. In many cases goodwill and community norms have
vanished so the only way forward is legal/contractual. This is regrettable
because it leads to the difficulties we have already seen, but these are
preferable to non-distribution of knowledge or restriction in its use.

I calculate that the opportunity cost of closed access publication runs
into many billions and that the failure to allow - say - unrestricted
text-mining is a considerable part of these costs. I think it's really
important that we try to estimate this and we need to be able to counter
the argument of "everything is OK now and we don't need to change it".

We do need to change it, and massively.

No evidence for this. Nearly all CC-BY works are available free of cost. CC
could clarify that re-enclosure in the digital context isn't allowed.

Regardless wthat people say Ms. Morrison is spreading misinformation. There
is an immense bulk of CC-BY licensed scholarly articles with authors
apparently having NO concerns with CC-BY.

In the context of commercial publishing NC is a joke because NO re-use is
possible. The hypothetical possibility that someone is selling a work
should be the reason to de facto only grant gratis OA?

This isn't true at least for image re-use.

I am in doubt that nothing can convince Ms. Morrison.

A license can not manage scholarly misconduct. No evidence for harmful
derivatives is given.

Indeed. The license very clearly states that you, the licensee, "may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits." (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US)

Unless all copies of the work vanish from the face of the earth except for the ones remaining in the vault of an evil publisher who then decides to charge for access to the vault, what Heather states above is not possible. And, even in the unlikely scenario I describe, once someone pays for access to the vault and then downloads the work, that work is once again free like the original.

Heather, I know that you believe in open scholarship and want to protect it from possible harm from commercially motivated evil interests, but what you are saying above is simply incorrect.

Puneet.

Very different things. The BOAI is about open access to scientific, scholarly publications. CC-BY is a BOAI-compliant licence that attenuates the damaging power of copyright that is automatically foisted upon any utterance a scientist makes, particularly if written up.

> It is particularly important for open access advocates to be aware that CC licenses, including CC-BY, do not mean that works must be made available free of charge.

This is a very peculiar argument. The CC-BY licence exists to cover an open access, freely available work. It simply makes no sense to attach a CC-BY licence to a work you want to charge for. 
the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Just think of the practicalities if you should want to charge. You may even be able to do that once, but since you can't stop further free dissemination in any way, that would be fairly pointless.
 
> CC-BY policy has a huge, potentially systemic loophole: the possibility of re-enclosure.

How would you possibly do that? The licence is irrevocable. Have you heard of the genie and the bottle? Well, it's like that.

> What is given freely today with a CC-BY license could easily be available solely through sale from Elsevier or services like RightsLink down the road. 

They could charge what they want, but they won't be able to stop the material being available for free. 
>

Such exclusive licence to publish is needed for CC-BY-NC, as republishing can be seen as a commercial activity, which is forbidden without a special licence from the copyright holder, who is presumably the author. For a CC-BY licence, such a special licence is vapour and has the value and enforcability of a special licence that allows you to breath air. 
>

The more that researchers equate OA with CC-BY, the greater the probability that the backlash will be against OA rather than against CC-BY. Recent concerns expressed by scholars about people selling works they have licensed CC-BY should be taken as a reason for caution.

The consequences of profit-spite should be on the researchers own head. Researchers publishing with NC clauses will just have a much greater risk of being ignored, and that risk will increase with the availability of more proper OA (BOAI-compliant, CC-BY).

How would you do proper meta-analyses without 'derivative' rights? How would you do any science without 'derivative' rights? 'Derivative' suffers from the same vagueness and ambiguity as does 'commercial', resulting in FUD which equates to the material being rendered practically useless for proper large-scale modern science.

Let's take a practical, and fairly oft occurring, example, and say that the 'derivative' is translation in another language. Let;s assume a minority language. Euskara, for the sake of the argument. Or Welsh. Or Frisian. Who decides if the 'derivative' is correct? Phantasmagoric, is the word, if I've correctly translated that from the Dutch 'hersenschimmig'.

An authority if there ever was one, of course.

That's like saying the ocean and ships overlap but don't match.

Nobody is forcing CC licences. If anything is 'forced', it is open access. And proper, BOAI-compliant open access just happens to be best covered by a CC-BY or CC-Zero licence. Until an even better licence is formulated.

No evidence for this. Nearly all CC-BY works are available free of cost. CC could clarify that re-enclosure in the digital context isn't allowed.

Indeed. The license very clearly states that you, the licensee, "may not apply legal terms or technological measures<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US#> that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits." (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US)

Two comments:

CC would have to have the agreement of the Creative Commons community to change the licenses to prevent re-enclosure. From time to time I participate in the CC community list and have raised the question about CC and free of charge. The short answer is that there are many people in the Creative Commons community for whom freedom means freedom to put up a paywall and charge for works. Consider the difference between open source software, where the code is free for anyone to manipulate, but software creators are free to charge for the software, and open access with its "free of charge". Klaus, I very much encourage you to sign up for the CC community discussion and check in with them about this question:
http://lists.ibiblio.org/mailman/listinfo/cc-community

The licensee "may not apply legal terms or technological measures?" refers to applying legal terms or adding TPMs to the work per se. There is nothing to stop a downstream user from putting up a paywall before you get to the work. Indeed, it would not be possible to do this, as most of us need to go through a paywall to connect to the internet (whether we or someone else is paying).  We are already seeing that people are using articles to compile books for sale - people have to pay to get the book.

Wouldn't open posting of research data with no technical restrictions on re-use be a much more effective way of moving forward in this area? The Human Genome Project happened because of a decision to collaborate and share data - I would argue that this is the best example of what we can accomplish in this area. However, this was substantially complete between the beginning of the Creative Commons project.

Perhaps it was another case of premature summary, but you completely missed the subsequent para in my email where I wrote, "Unless all copies of the work vanish from the face of the earth except for the ones remaining in the vault of an evil publisher who then decides to charge for access to the vault, what Heather states above is not possible. And, even in the unlikely scenario I describe, once someone pays for access to the vault and then downloads the work, that work is once again free like the original."

Indeed, if I download your CC BY work, I have all the right in the world (no matter how misplaced one may think it is) to charge for that work. On the other hand, others have all the right in the world to ignore my offering and get your work directly from you or from other sources completely free if it is still available. The only reason a sane person would pay me for an otherwise freely available work is if I add something of value to that work.

All right, folks. I do believe we've crossed over into troll-feeding now.

I for one will now try to resist SIWOTI syndrome on this thread. Let's
just agree to let Heather have the last word, then it can all be over.

We have to understand that putting research results in the public domain is the most effective way of ensuring the free flow of information. CC-BY is a way to secure acknowledgement for researchers, without which the 'system' won't recognise their contributions and they won't be able to make a career out of science. The CC-BY licence does not exist for the sake of the openness of the information it covers, but for the sake of researchers' need for attribution.

Actually, I disagree with this point. I am not saying I can prove it, but
having thought about this for a few years I do not think that the author
needs CC-BY nor any form of insurance that attribution will occur - at
least not intrinsically for the sake of the proper functioning of scholarly
practice.

The reason why I think this is that the onus falls not on the author but on
the user of the work to provide attribution.

For example, if I use your work as part of the basis of my work and I do
not attribute you, then there should be an obvious gaping hole in my own
publication - and any other good researcher should ask me why I have an
unsupported assumption in my work. Similarly if I use your work and it is
so well known that others can see I have copied it, then I am being very
impolite and possibly deceptive, and so other good researchers should point
this out. If my unattributed use of your work is down to the fact that your
work has become a de facto part of the foundation of our field of study,
then - well done you, you have already succeeded in making a huge
contribution to the scholarly practice.

So, the purpose of attribution is not in fact acknowledgement but
provenance.

It just so happens that an upside to this (if you can consider it an
upside) is that authors get recognition for the work they did - but
pleasing the authors ego (or requirement to prove use of their work due to
the arbitrary method of fund allocation we employ at this particular time)
should not be the driving force for attribution.

I would be interested in what other people think about this.

What I am, and others are, arguing is that even if a work covered by CC-BY is not made available for free initially, it will be completely free for further distribution subsequently. Thus rather defeating the object of charging the first time around. In a way, you could regard the APC as a charge for that first time around.

No, downstream selling is fine. Anyone can try to sell it. And in some cases that might be beneficial, for instance a local entrepreneur in an emerging economy selling a print version to people without bandwidth or even an internet connection of works that are only electronically available, thus reaching an audience that would not otherwise be reached. An anthology of CC-BY articles brought together in a textbook for use in classrooms in Mongolia, say. Perfectly allowed. What is not allowed is to remove the free availability of the original, CC-BY-covered work, by any legal or technical means.

I'm perfectly happy for Heather to enjoy her assumed role of being a voice in the wilderness. She's entitled to it.

CC-BY is a way to secure acknowledgement for researchers, without which the 'system' won't recognise their contributions and they won't be able to make a career out of science. The CC-BY licence does not exist for the sake of the openness of the information it covers, but for the sake of researchers' need for attribution.

I am not saying I can prove it, but having thought about this for a few years I do not think that the author needs CC-BY nor any form of insurance that attribution will occur - at least not intrinsically for the sake of the proper functioning of scholarly practice.

I actually agree with you. Attribution is a 'cultural', community custom. CC-BY is only a kind of 'assurance' for authors. People generally want assurances, even though they don't strictly 'need' them. Provenance and attribution are kind of intertwined, though.
Another reason to choose CC-BY over CC-Zero is some assurance for the integrity of the work. Even if you change it, you'd have to cite the original work, so you can't ? theoretically at least ? drift too far from its original content without being found out.

If my unattributed use of your work is down to the fact that your work has become a de facto part of the foundation of our field of study, then - well done you, you have already succeeded in making a huge contribution to the scholarly practice.

The Human Genome Project happened because of a decision to collaborate and share data - I would argue that this is the best example of what we can accomplish in this area. However, this was substantially complete between the beginning of the Creative Commons project.

I disagree with Heather's stance and conclusion, but I do very much appreciate her belief in Open as a preferred state of being. I will err to assume our disagreement is based not on dogma but on a misunderstanding of how licenses work and their role as both a legal instrument as well as a sociocultural signal for behavior. From that assumption stems my belief that if I (we) can get our message across constructively and patiently, we will only be doing good service to the cause of open scholarship.

I speak all of the above (and below) for myself, but undoubtedly I am influenced by and influence the organizations I may be associated or employed with.

It would be helpful to the discussion to focus on the substantive points. Calling people who disagree with you names does not prove your point.

Comment:

Thank you, Mr. Puneet Kishor. I would agree that some of the discussion has to do with how the license actually work, and echo that I appreciate the work of my colleagues in the open access movement even when we don't agree on  a particular issue.

>From my perspective there are other considerations besides how the licenses work per se. For example,

1. What is it that people want the license to accomplish? and the related question - is licensing the most effective approach to achieve the desired goal?

2. Are the needs, benefits and risks of different licenses the same for every type of scholarly work? Do we fully understand the needs, benefits and risks of different licenses?

3. If we are experimenting with new types of uses of works (allowing downstream commercial use and derivatives, for example), who might want to make use of these new rights, and for what purpose?

4. Let's separate the question of whether a particular license is best for scholarship from the question of whether there is a compelling case to require a particular license through policy.

best,

Heather Morrison

Dear Heather, I'm not calling you names (unless I totally misunderstand what that expression means in English). What I mean by 'voice in the wilderness' is your nigh biblical passion for a lone position in this discussion.

Best,

Hi All

I think this particular thread has run its course so I would request that
any focused follow on discussion is started on another thread.
Thanks for posing these questions Heather and feel free to begin another
thread if you feel the list can work towards answering some of them.

Jenny

Hi All

Just a couple of list etiquette points

1) We were far away from the subject line in the previous thread, if those
starting new topics could change this to something more relevant and
reference the original subject it is much easier for subscribers to follow
(or not!) and later to find topics in the list archive. The previous
discussion could have been several distinct threads.

2) There are obviously strong personalities on this list and for that we
are very grateful because it makes for lively discussion about an area
where there is still considerable debate and a lot of thinking to do
(that's why we're all here!). In general you're great at self-regulation
but please bear in mind that if only a few people are contributing and
headway is not being made for whatever reason, it may be time to politely
discontinue, take discussions off-list or start a new thread on a more
constructive topic, citing this reason.

Thanks very much!

Jenny

Question for you:

Are you suggesting that a single entity (e.g. publisher) can take a CC-BY
licensed work, and arbitrarily determine to sell it - in so doing,
eradicate all previously distributed, stored, freely available CC-BY
versions of the same work, such that they can force people into paying for
the version that is being sold?

CC-BY does not prevent somebody from selling a version of the work, but it
does prevent it being sold without acknowledging the CC-BY version, and as
long as you know that there is a CC-BY version, then the only thing that
prevents you from being able to obtain (and use, and re-use) it freely is
carelessness. As long as you take the CC-BY version, and redistribute it -
e.g. via a number of institution or subject repositories - then it will
forever be available at no cost.

Nothing can be done to change that, and it's not simply a theoretical point
- exactly the same conditions have been tested time and time again with
open source software (with derivatives being taken into a commercial
license).

Thanks Jenny,
It's also worth pointing out that there was no need for cross-posting to
two lists (Yes, I was guilty). The last > 50% had no primary relation to
science and it could be off-putting for people wanting to get a feel of how
to start discussions there.

But since there's lots of enthusiasm I'm posting another (topical)
thread.... on content-mining.

on the appropriate list:
https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-contentmining
where we can discuss Elsevier's announcement on content mining

Message-ID: <CAD2k14NMP7Z3wVF28cbTGfdbWvR6oxNPw7O+AF6dbYYaaOr17Q@mail.gmail.com>

Two suggestions about list discipline.

The latest thread on this list was also posted in parallel to open-science
although there was not always much open-scientific content. This can have a
downside as (say) the open-science memebers get large amounts of material
no of direct relevance.

It's partly my fault - I failed to notice the original crossposting and my
reply automatically re-crossposted and it went on from there...

I'd suggest that posts are only directed at one list. If there seems a need
to post to more than one list consider what the likely response would be
and post a copy to any list rather than crossposting.

The various lists have been set up to reflect different interest groups.
Where interests overlap it's probably safe to assume that many people will
have dual subscriptions.

Also be careful in quoting. Only quote the material relevant and snip it
where possible. This makes it easier for those who (say) need audio readers
or people wishing to summarise discussions.

Absolutely.  Also, please, please, use standard quoting conventions.  For about three decades, quoted lines have been preceded with a greater-than symbol and usually a space, like my above quotation of Peter?s words (your mail viewer may display this in various ways - mine indents the quoted text and shows a solid bar in the left-hand margin - but that?s the underlying format).  All email software understands this format (including accessibility tools such as audio readers) and so do all experienced email users.  Any other method of quoting risks authorship becoming confused, or your contributions being overlooked.

See http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/email-style.html for a document about 25 years old which describes this convention in much more detail and gives some history.

Open Repositories Conference Update: OR2014 Proposal Deadline Extended

A message from the Open Repositories 2014 Conference organizers

Helsinki, Finland. The final deadline for submitting proposals for the
Ninth International Conference on Open Repositories (#or2014) has been
extended until Monday, Feb. 10, 2014. The conference is scheduled to
take place June 9-13 in Helsinki and is being hosted by University of
Helsinki's twin libraries: Helsinki University Library and the
National Library of Finland.

The theme this year is "Towards Repository Ecosystems" emphasizing the
interconnected nature of repositories, institutions, technologies,
data and the people who make it all work together. You may review the
call for proposals here: http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=281.

This year the Open Repositories team will be operating a pilot
programme to offer a small number of 'registration fee only'
scholarships for this conference. Details will be announced on the
conference website when registration opens.

Submit your proposal here: https://www.conftool.com/or2014/ by Feb. 10, 2014.

We look forward to seeing you at OR2014!

Hi Andrea

Yes, the questions you raise have come up in several of the comments to the
consultation (and feel free to add your own of course). The issue of
implementation and name spaces has come up in several comments and we will
look at this as we refine the recommendations. The elements will be
implemented by Crossref rapidly. It would be great to include them in a
revision of OAI-PMH and DC but the question does arise of whether to create
a separate name space. We also need to consider how to combine with the
relevant JATS tag.

Anyway, short answer, hopefully we will have some more precise
recommendations after the consultation closes, probably in mid-February or
early March.

Cheers

Cameron

Springer launches first open access journal in Religion: International Journal of Dharma Studies
http://oaopenaccess.wordpress.com/2014/01/30/springer-launches-first-open-access-journal-in-religion-international-journal-of-dharma-studies/
 
It was almost two years ago that I received an email from the then publishing editor in Religion and Philosophy at Springer Science+Business Media expressing an interest by the publisher to launch open access journals in Religion. I wrote about the conversation I had with the editor in response to that email back in March 2012.
 
At that point Springer had no open access journals in Religious Studies, although it published seven subscription-based journals in the discipline. This has now changed. At the end of 2013 the International Journal of Dharma Studies (ISSN 2196-8802) launched on the SpringerOpen platform.

Continues?

Subject: [Open-access] WHO's new vision
Message-ID: <CAGyWN8bmEdG39wVOX1edjX2t+H1cSRszr0HBrSiqi-cHd6tu+Q@mail.gmail.com>

WHO has a new vision for information sharing

http://www.who.int/about/who_reform/change_at_who/issue4/information-sharing/en/index.html#.UuVWA8pwYm-

*A new policy on open access will be announced in January 2014 and come
into force in July 2014. The policy will apply to all WHO-authored or
WHO-funded research published in non-WHO publications, such as external
journals and books.*

*The Institutional Repository for Information Sharing (IRIS), created in
2012, enables more people to access WHO's information products. IRIS is the
multilingual digital library of WHO, providing free access to the full text
of WHO information products in the six official languages.*

And this is exactly what the repository does, providing access. Searching
the IRIS I noticed for all publications the exclusive copyright notice.
This means that in principle WHO is NOT offering open access in the sense
that we understand it. The material can in principle just be read. For me
this reflects the difficulty with many repositories, that it is perfectly
unclear on the subject of re-use. Imagine that I want to select a subset of
publications from the WHO repository for use in another location, it is not
allowed.  if you are not allowed re-use the information is almost useless The
repository structure promotes fragmentation.The fact that the information
you want is sitting in multiple locations in '?pen access' repositories
makes it more difficult to find ,and nothing can be done since aggregating
is also re-use.  If we were allowed to duplicate the publications that we
need then we could build topical databases that would simplify access. As
long as repositories are not open access in the sense of the Berlin
declaration they will not be as useful as they could be.    I am utterly
amazed that an organization as big as the WHO offers read-only open access
as their new vision of information sharing.

I would really be interested to know the vision of other following this
list concerning this topic

I share your concerns. The WHO is an international organization and I
believe traditional copyright does not apply. However here is its own
declaration:
http://www.who.int/about/copyright/en/

<quote>

The information in the various pages of the WHO web site is issued by the
World Health Organization for general distribution. The information
presented is protected under the Berne Convention for the Protection of
Literature and Artistic works, under other international conventions and
under national laws on copyright and neighbouring rights. Extracts of the
information in the web site may be reviewed, reproduced or translated for
research or private study but not for sale or for use in conjunction with
commercial purposes.

Any use of information in the web site should be accompanied by an
acknowledgment of WHO as the source, citing the uniform resource locator
(URL) of the article. Reproduction or translation of substantial portions
of the web site, or any use other than for educational or other
non-commercial purposes, require explicit, prior authorization in writing.
Applications and enquiries should be addressed to the programme responsible
for the page used.
</quote>

My hope is that with constant pressure WHO will come to see the value of an
explicitly more liberal statement.

Hi, Victoria. Your message did get through, I think it unfortunately
just didn't attract any replies!

The best person to talk to about OA advocacy in the humanities is
probably Martin Eve, who is involved in the Open Library of Humanities
project and has written extensively on OA from the HSS perspective.
You can reach him on <martin at martineve.com>; if I know him, he'll be
happy to help you out.

You're right, this is also important. But in general, it's much harder
to fix that OA for new articles going forward, because exploitative
publishers have already acquired the copyright they need to enforce
artificial scarcity.

This is something that I think should be solvable in principle.
Copyright expires after a number of years. Depending on several factors, this can be 28 years, 70 years, 95 years or 120 years. So in most cases, a 1994 article is still protected by copyright and is just as difficult to make OA as any other copyrighted, more recent article.

But I agree with you that libraries should try and harvest everything, independent of its protection and make available everything that is legal to make available.
I would really like to see how one would apply copyright law to determine which articles in the scholarly literature could be seen as publicly accessible at this point in time and what percentage of the scholarly literature this would be. 
Does anybody know someone who could answer this question, ideally in paper form for our special issue? :-)

Cheers,

Bjoern

I fully understand. It's not just in HSS. Chemical papers 100 years old are
still useful. And certainly i observational biology.

It's worth using the OAButton - if only to reduce your blood pressure. It
may also highlight the problem - if OAButton can count the ages of the
papers that might show your problem was common.

The forces for change could be (a) legislation. (b) a change in the
publishing market. Neither are fast. (c) Civil disobedience would also
work.

Hi, Victoria. Your message did get through, I think it unfortunately just didn't attract any replies!

The best person to talk to about OA advocacy in the humanities is probably Martin Eve, who is involved in the Open Library of Humanities project and has written extensively on OA from the HSS perspective.
You can reach him on <martin at martineve.com>; if I know him, he'll be happy to help you out.

Isn't it the case that for everything published before 1999 the copyright
does not apply to any electronic version?

Wow! If that were the case, one could build an OA database of every article published before 1999!

I find that hard to believe, can that be correct?

That's wonderful!
In Polish copyright law, there has been always the concept of "fields of 
exploitation" of a creative work. For the transfer of copyright to be 
legally correct and binding, all intended fields of exploitation must be 
explicitly named in the contract between author and publisher. If a 
given field is not specified, copyright is not transfered for this field 
of use. Moreover, it's not allowed to use general statements like "all 
fields of exploitation" or "all future fields of exploitation" - this is 
incorrect and has no legal effect. For a reference, see: 
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Polish_Copyright_Law (Article 41, p. 2 & 
4) or http://www.artserwis.pl/index.php?f=1&fgid=1&fqid=23 (in Polish).

Now, internet and digital distribution is a new, separate field of 
exploitation. But in contracts signed before internet era, say until 
90s, this field couldn't have been specified, so all those contracts are 
valid only for traditional forms of use of the work and not for the web. 
Thus, for internet use, copyright to these publications still belongs to 
respective authors and not to publishers. :)

That's how it works in Poland. It can be different in other countries.

Thanks Marcin for this very valuable piece of  information.
I still do not recall exactly where I heard that copyright for articles
published before 1999 does nor apply to electronic versions.
I think I heard this at the Berlin10 conference in South Africa , I will
try to find the right citation (Mike)

... to be more specific.
Germany, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Spain... apply or used to apply the 
same rule as Poland in respect to "future fields of exploitation", 
namely disallowing copyright transfer on fields of exploitation unknown 
at the time of the contract. Source: this book 
<http://books.google.pl/books?id=03GwJ17bt-QC&pg=PA126&lpg=PA126&dq=future+forms+of+exploitation+copyright&source=bl&ots=rXNAKBeSDm&sig=RdcibHxNN8oCeBpt4SVjj8eXG0g&hl=en&sa=X&ei=-ArsUq2zAYO0hAe7soHYCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=future%20forms%20of%20exploitation%20copyright&f=false>, 
sect. 3.2.5.

Therefore, all publications governed by law of these countries and 
published before internet era belong to respective authors as far as 
online use is concerned. Note that this includes publications by one of 
the biggest publishers, Springer. I looked into copyright transfer 
agreement that I had to sign a few years ago with Springer - it states 
that it's governed by German law, so I suspect that all past Springer 
publications are governed by German law, too.
