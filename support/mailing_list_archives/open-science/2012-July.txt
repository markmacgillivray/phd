Hello everyone, 

We're doing a study for the European Commission on Science 2.0 (not exactly Open Science but let's put it aside).

We've been using this list as a source of inspiration and evidence. We've been sharing our working notes on our blog: http://science20study.wordpress.com/

Now, we really need your help. We need to gather the BEST POSSIBLE EVIDENCE showing the Open Science is not a fad, that it's a long term change in the scientific process, and that European science institutions should take this into account.

As you know policy-makers want DATA: statistics, numbers, histograms... (even if not robust). Can you help us gathering more and better data?

We published the final presentation in commentable format: we ask you to share the evidence you have by adding comments to the slides. We have until JULY 24TH to gather it.

Thanks!

Presumably the examples don't have to be European? Although it would be
good to show that Europe was among the leaders in this area.

Hi Peter thanks. Examples don't have to be European. 
What we aim to show is that Open Science leads to better science; and that it's happening already.
We have gathered lots of individual cases: we need now to reinforce the evidence basis through data and evidence at a larger scale.
Beside that: any comment from the people in the list is certainly useful and welcome.
And yes, it would be great if you can link to the Hackathon!
best

Dear David,

Open Science is an umbrella term for various "open" activities,
including, but not limited to, open access, open source, open data,
etc. Despite the fact, that certain phrases are new, ideas behind open
science have a rather long history, especially in some fields (first
"Open Source Science" _conference_ was in late 90s).

There's an enormous amount of evidence, as long as you don't try to
think about every field having the same cultural background. For
example, the whole LHC is a result of "open science" put in practice
(Arxiv, open source grid software, immediate data availability). BTW,
you miss high-energy physics (and lots of activities by CERN) in your
presentation.

The general comment I have is that you seem to focus on the very
recent examples of "2.0", creating an impression that it is a brand
new phenomenon. It isn't - it's just unevenly distributed. I think
this changes the perspective in presentation (from IF, to HOW).

I will make specific comments in GDocs.

Best wishes
PS

This may be of interest - just came in - haven't looked at it but anything
from JJ and Open Science Summit is worth looking at...

Hi all,

I have recently updated the Research and Education topic stream page for
OKFest: http://okfestival.org/topic-stream-open-research-and-education/

As speakers confirm and we begin to finalise the sessions, the programme is
looking more and more exciting - we hope to gather even more details in the
coming weeks. Things are also moving forward fast logistically, so I
strongly recommend you to start exploring flights and accommodation at this
stage. Logistically, most Science events will be taking place on Wednesday
19th September, with some sessions spilling over onto Thursday 20th. There
will also be a satellite Hackday to kick-start events on Tuesday 18th
September.

The more people we can get together to talk about Open Science and Open
Access, the more valuable OKFest will be - so do try to join us if you can!

Looking forward to seeing you there!

All the best,
Laura

Subject: [open-science] Gamify your PhD: open science games
Message-ID: <CABPM+wqqkvhCR6xVvB-4QBUAp3n8tmma0ru4BjfwLGg5=QOYCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

The Wellcome Trust is running a competition to 'Gamify your PhD' (open to
anyone currently doing a PhD in biomedical science/medical humanities or
who has completed one in the last 3 years)

From
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2012/WTVM055859.htm

The Trust is inviting researchers to share ideas for games based on their
PhD work in biomedical science or the medical humanities, and small teams
of games developers to turn these ideas into addictive, challenging and
educational games. Those selected will partner at a two-day hack in which
the games will be created. The best of these will receive funding to
develop into a releasable game.

Deadline is 12 August for applications from PhD students with their ideas
or teams of 3-4 developers to generate the games so consider
Info for researchers:
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Public-engagement/Funded-projects/Major-initiatives/Broadcast-media-strategy/Gamify-Your-PhD/WTDV033975.htm
Info for developers:
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Funding/Public-engagement/Funded-projects/Major-initiatives/Broadcast-media-strategy/Gamify-Your-PhD/WTDV033976.htm

Results will be CC licensed and winners will be funded for full development
and release.

This sounds like a really fun initiative and if you think you could make a
game to gather data for your project via distributed thinking, we would
encourage you to consider using the pyBOSSA platform for your app
http://pybossa.com/ :-)

Hi Peter and other list members,

I just happened to find very interesting info on quality of medical
journals, new forms for peer review, patient-doctor interactions to improve
science and treatments, journal of participatory medicine to aid the
former, Ovations initiative for combating chronic diseases in developed and
developing world.
All this because I read an article on scientific quality mentioning Richard
Smith and started looking:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Smith_(editor)

I am amazed that I haven't come across this before,since he is one of the
early proponents of open access publishing. But some of you may know him
and his work?
Definitely worth following up in my opinion

TOM

I had heard of him but don't come across him regularly so it had faded. I
think he has been brave and is some years ahead of his time and it's clear
that he needs promoting. Maybe  a Panton Discussion .

Hi All

Just a note to draw your attention to Ideas Incubator
http://ideas.okfn.org/ a site where you can propose projects you'd
like to get started within OKF. The following are recent open science
related proposals so please comment on them, vote them up or down and
add your own ideas:

A web community of academics with the aim of killing the current
journal publishing model
http://ideas.okfn.org/ideas/422/a-web-community-of-academics-with-the-aim-of-killing-the-current-journal-publishing-model

OKFN Open Scientific Data Journal
http://ideas.okfn.org/ideas/155/okfn-open-scientific-data-journal

Discussion is of course also welcome on the list - is there a need for
a cross-disciplinary open data journal and could OKFN fill that gap?
Is the absence of highly successful systems for community discussion
of papers among academics due to lack of tools or lack of enthusiasm?
Plenty of food for thought!

Jenny

To: RTD-SCIENTIFIC-PUBLICATION at ec.europa.eu


Dear friends of open access,

We are happy to announce that the European Commission has today
outlined measures to improve access to scientific knowledge produced
in Europe. Better access to EU-funded scientific papers and data will
make it easier for researchers and businesses to build on the results
of publicly-funded research. This will boost Europe's innovation
capacity and give citizens quicker access to scientific discoveries.

The Communication sets out open access policy objectives for the
research funded by the Commission through Horizon 2020. An
accompanying Recommendation provides a policy framework for improving
access to a preservation of scientific information in EU Member
States.

For more information take a look at

http://ec.europa.eu/research/science-society/open_access

(click on "background" to access the documents)

Feel free to contact us at RTD-SCIENTIFIC-PUBLICATION at ec.europa.eu if
you have any questions.

Best regards,

The Open Access team

Subject: [open-science] Databib: Call for Editors
Message-ID: <F8BED7E51CA83043AB374FCA465A0C1C486B3CC5DF@VPEXCH02.purdue.lcl>

Databib, http://databib.org, is a tool for helping people to identify and locate online repositories of research data. Over 200 data repositories have been cataloged in Databib, with more being added every week. Users and bibliographers create and curate records that describe data repositories that users can browse and search.

* What repositories are appropriate for a researcher to submit his or her data to?
* How do users find appropriate data repositories and discover datasets to meet their needs?
* How can librarians help patrons locate and integrate data into their research or learning?

Databib begins to address these needs for data users, data producers, publishers, librarians, funding agencies, and others engaged in data-driven research.

In addition to the website, Databib is made available using a variety of machine interfaces (RSS, RDF/XML, OpenSearch, RDFa/Linked Data) for easy integration with other tools and environments without restriction (CC0). Databib's international advisory board represents global support for collaborating to develop such a global registry of research data repositories.

The development of Databib was initially supported by a Sparks! Innovation National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

CALL FOR EDITORS

Nominations for an Editorial Board are being solicited to ensure the coverage and accuracy of Databib. Editors ideally will have expertise in a specific research domain or knowledge of research data repositories in a particular geographic region as well as experience with descriptive metadata. The primary role of an Editor is to review, edit, and approve submissions to Databib and contribute to the enhancement of the metadata and functionality of Databib for a voluntary, three-year term. The Editorial Board will meet (virtually) a minimum of twice a year and will correspond as needed by email.

Please send nominations or questions to databib at gmail.com, or visit http://databib.org/about.php for more information. Thank you.

This looks very exciting

I have crossposted to open-bibliography because Bibserver should be able to
ingest the metadata and manage it as a Bibsoup.

Hi Michael,

This sounds great and sounds like an analogy for science of what we've
been doing with Data Catalogs site for open data sites generally (and
especially open gov data sites):

In case this could be something we get involved in. Needs a UK academic as
partner (I don't count)


Please find below BBSRC funding opportunities.



   - *BBSRC: Tools and Resources Development Fund: Call 1*

The Tools and Resources Development Fund aims to pump prime the next
generation of tools, technologies and resources that will be required by
bioscience researchers. The call will consider proposals for:****

   - Early concept, exploratory investigations of new tools, technologies
   and resources.****
   - Rapid access to, and novel deployment of, the very latest cutting edge
   technology (such proposals would normally include collaboration with the
   technology provider).****
   - Radical, novel modifications to existing tools, technologies and
   resources to facilitate new biological understanding and an expansion in
   use.****

** **

Applications should be for early concept development, particularly where
little pilot data exists. It is intended that funded research will involve
interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches and applications should
demonstrate appropriate collaborative connections, and biological
demonstration/knowledge derivation.****

Applicants interested in submitting projects related to the development of
bioinformatics, computational biology or algorithms, including data
sharing, should submit applications to the second call to be issued later
in 2012.****

*Funding*: The call will have an indicative budget of ?1.5M and successful
grants will not normally exceed ?120,000. Projects will last between 6 and
18 months.****

*Eligibility*: Normal BBSRC eligibility rules apply.****

*Deadline*: 4 September 2012 (16:00)****

For more information see:
http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/funding/opportunities/2012/2012-tools-resources-development-call1.aspx




   - *BBSRC: Sustainable Bioenergy and Biofuels*

** **
The BBSRC and the Department of Biotechnology (DBT) in India invite
collaborative (UK-India) research proposals that underpin the generation
and implementation of sustainable, advanced, bioenergy (including
biofuels). The call is focused around three priority areas:****
** **

   - Identification, characterisation and improvement of novel biomass
   (including algal biomass) processing enzymes.****
   - Application of systems and synthetic biology approaches for the
   development of microbial strains for the production of advanced biofuels
   and capable of using all of the sugars derived from lignocellulosic or
   algal biomass.****
   - The improvement of algal strains suitable for biofuel applications
   including genomics approaches.****

** **
Projects can address biological routes including bacteria, yeast, fungi,
micro- and macro-algae and terrestrial plant derived biomass. Applicants
considering projects outside the priority areas above should contact the
BBSRC at an early stage. All projects must employ second generation or
beyond technologies and should demonstrate that sustainability factors have
been taken into consideration.****
** **
The call will not fund theoretical projects that are not coupled with
experimental work, projects based on networking and knowledge transfer
only, the exploitation of thermochemical and/or other non-biological routes
to produce bioenergy; projects using first generation biofuel technologies;
or projects using feedstocks specific to the UK or India (unless used to
demonstrate a principle that can readily be translated to other feedstocks).
****
** **
*Eligibility*: Proposals must include applicants based in India and the UK
working together in cross-national teams on cross-disciplinary projects.
All UK applicants must adhere to BBSRC eligibility rules, while Indian
applicants must adhere to DBT rules. Non-eligible institutions may be
included in a project, but they will not receive funding.****
** **
*Funding*: BBSRC will fund the UK components and DBT the Indian components
of successful projects. Both bodies have earmarked up to ?5M for the call.
Projects should be up to a maximum duration of 3 years. There is no upper
cost limit per project, but it should be noted that multiple projects will
be funded. BBSRC funding will be awarded on the basic of full economic
costs and cannot be used to fund PhD students.****
** **
*Deadlines*:      Intention to submit form ? 30 August 2012 (16:00)****
Full proposals ? 9 October 2012 (16:00)****
** **

   - *Nitrogen: Improving on nature ? A joint BBSRC and NSF Ideas Lab*

** **
The BBSRC and the National Science Foundation (US) invite expressions of
interest to participate in an Ideas Lab Workshop to be held at Crewe Hall,
near Crewe (UK) from 3-7 December 2012.****
** **
The Lab will seek to develop innovative and transformative ways to reduce
inputs of nitrogen fertilizers to non-leguminous crops whilst maintaining
or increasing yield, through a multidisciplinary approach. This could be
achieved by:****
** **

   - Giving crops the ability to fix their own nitrogen****
   - Significantly increasing the nitrogen available to roots by
   manipulating the rhizosphere; or****
   - Significantly improving the crop?s nitrogen use efficiency.****

** **
Other approaches are also welcome, but the proposals generated by the Lab
are expected to have the potential to lead to a step-change in current
knowledge. A multi-disciplinary approach will be adopted and it is intended
that the Lab will lead to strong transatlantic alliances.****
** **
*Funding*: The Ideas Lab will develop outline proposals that will
subsequently be developed into full proposals and submitted for
consideration by the funding agencies. Up to $12M is available to fund
these proposals. Researchers who do not wish to participate in the Lab, but
would like to apply for BBSRC funding in this area can submit an
application at any time through responsive mode.****
** **
*Deadlines*: Applications must be received by 7 September 2012 (16:00)****

Thank you Mark, that's quite a move from the UK. Let's hope other countries
in the EU will follow.

On the debate Gold OA versus Green OA, I also recommand the editorial from
the Guardian
http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/blog/2012/jul/17/open-access-scientific-research?INTCMP=SRCH


And for a wider perspective on OA, data-Intensive research and public
engagement, the report from the Royal Society is worth reading

Subject: [open-science] query regarding language in permission to mine
Message-ID: <8E4475CF-D6E9-4CD3-8CF1-D9AC30873258@icommons.org>

This is the draft of a clause that would waive attribution when mining.  

Do any of you have any thoughts on whether this language is reasonable for the purpose?  Is attribution stacking a problem that truly needs to be addressed?

I am a bit concerned that it leaves a possible loophole allowing the miner to intentionally omit any identifiable characteristics simply to avoid attribution.  Is that an inescapable problem?

Any advice would be appreciated.

Apologies!  The relevant clause is:

"The [requirement of attribution] shall not apply to the products of text, data and other information mining processes where the Work or portions thereof that appear in the mined product are not identifiable by their original source."

 Sustainable Development: Call for Ideas
Message-ID: <CAChagOCYR22sRxE0wnsmSVF=w7DBYK1oKH5J4O0fE8g_vH1yqw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I would like to invite you to contribute with ideas to a forthcoming
Citizen Cyber Science Hackfest around Sustainable Development:

http://okfnpad.org/cyberscience-hackfestccd, taking place in Sao Paulo at
the end of the week:

http://br.okfn.org/2012/07/09/brasilhome-hackfest-de-ciberciencia-cidada/

Please suggest good projects that fit this topic and that make use of open
data, open source or open content.

We would like to collect "data about existing citizen science projects that
target in one way or other sustainable development, especially topics like
deforestation (like the ForestWatchers project - forestwatchers.net),
deglaciation, species depopulation and other georeferenced challenges where
citizen data collection can make a difference". (quoting Francois's e-mail)

"There are hundreds of such projects, and what I hope our event can help
launch is some sort of coordination between them, at least as far as
assisting newcomers to discover projects they can usefully contribute to."
This is part of a bigger project called GeoSocial, which would be
introduced at the Sao Paulo event.

If you are interested to participate - in person or remotely, please let us
know!

Message-ID: <501016F5.5000207@princeton.edu>

Hello,

I'm new entrant to the Open Science list. My name is Ethan Perlstein, 
I'm an evolutionary pharmacologist at Princeton, and my lab gives psych 
drugs to yeast.

Recently, I commissioned a modular, self publishing platform built on WP 
from a professional web design team, and my site went live a month ago: 
http://perlsteinlab.com

In the spirit of Open Science, I'd like to make my platform freely 
available and open source. After consultations, the consensus is to 
convert my site into a Wordpress theme via a community-based effort. I'm 
looking for anyone interested in helping me, which as I understand 
ultimately boils down to uploading the base code onto GitHub. However, 
not being a programmer myself, I don't know how to navigate this process 
and ensure that conversion to a WP theme is efficient and actually 
results in a usable platform.

Please let me know if this project is of interest, and if you or anyone 
you know would be interesting in using such a platform.

Thanks,
Ethan

Is it specifically based on GitHub? Or would any repository do?

All such ideas are interesting -  the OKF is a meritocracy so take-up
depends on the ideas and the implementation being compelling.

My personal experience with WP is that it's the de facto open standard - so
I use it - but it seems awful for semantic content such as XML. But maybe
it's got better...

Thanks Peter and Cameron.  Can you bear to educate me even further?

Sec 4.2 of the JISC report on Value and benefits of text mining gave an example of 2930 full-text articles in which the word "malaria" appears.  Am I wrong to think that a miner would have to cite all 2930?  Or if the mining finds a pattern that only appears in 900 of them, then must cite the entire 900?  What is the 'proximate' source in such cases: an Elselvier database of journal articles?

Where this is a large set that is more challenging but it would still be good practice anyway to maintain a list of sources, even if not with the primary distribution. This is just good provenance information for the derivative work.

A similar problem occurs in data analysis. Let's say someone analyses the
size of molecules from the Protein Data Bank and uses 25,000 . For the
purposes of SCIENCE they should report the identifiers for the proteins
that fall into a particular category (e.g. we found 23 proteins with holes
in them ABC1, DEF2, ECH1). But if you started with 24,758 entries no-one
would cite all 24,578. And they are doing this primarily for fidelity of
the science.

With papers more "value" is currently given to citations (many of us want
to change the balance). But imagine you are listing the spellings of (say)
haemoglobine in the literature - a valuable thing to do for text-mining.
Yiou wouldn't say ("in 24,123 papers it was spelt hemoglobin and then cite
all of them. But you might say "in 10 papers it was spelt haemoglobine" and
then cite them as that might be the interesting bit. That's a poor example
_could do better.

So if there are more than X papers then I would only cite the details if it
was required for scientific reproducibility. I don't know what X is - it
will depend. In any case most such citation of bulk resources will almost
always be through identifiers

Dear All

Planning for the Open Research and Education stream at OKFest is nearing
finalisation but we'd love to get your input into some of the discussions
and sessions, even if you can't make it to Helsinki.

If you'd be willing to discuss your experiences (good or bad) with:

- Sharing your experimental raw data openly
- Innovative open access models
- Open science tools
- Communicating science openly (either with other scientists or the public)
- Challenges of dealing with crowd sourced data
- Obtaining data from museums for scientific research

Get in touch! There are a variety of ways to contribute content to the
talks and hands on sessions so we'd love to hear from you.

Best wishes

Jenny
