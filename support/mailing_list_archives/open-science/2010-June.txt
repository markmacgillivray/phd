Sorry, for delayed reply! This has been a very frequent question:

<http://wiki.okfn.org/ckan/doc/faq/#HowDoIDealwithDuplicatePackages>

Basic answer at the moment is: "merge by hand" and deprecate
("delete") duplicate package!

Subject: [open-science] Summary of today's meeting
Message-ID: <20100602183419.GA7428@grossmeier.net>

Hello Group,

Here is the agenda and summary from today's meeting:
http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/science/meetings/20100602

Reproduced below for your convenience (though no guarantee on 
formatting).

Best,

Greg



Agenda

    * CKAN for open data in science
          o Chemistry data pilot -- what metadata
          o Need for discovery tools? E.g. to fit with existing workflows 
    * Summaries in different domains. One or two - e.g. chemistry, 
biogenetics, or environmental, ...
          o Who are the key people in different areas... 
    * Panton Principles - what next? building consensus: e.g. Wellcome, 
NSF
    * Panton discussions - podcast / interview
    * Guest blog posts - detail but also for non-specialists...
    * Competitions
          o e.g.: 
http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/otherawards/ 
    * Logo / buttons
    *

      
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2010-February/000170.html
    * Interns/grad students call for participation (what could they work 
on?)
    * International open data in science event? Two day 
workshop/unconference? E.g. in 2011-2012? 

Summary

    * Searchable for science data
    * Biographical data on science 19th century 

Chemistry Data Discovery Process

    * many use paid databases
    * growing movement for freely accessible information
          o Many people coming through wikipedia or google search 
    * Getting ways to have Google index more information
          o But google might not do chemistry specific data (too small 
market) 
    * Is there a need for specific basic chemistry metadata set?
          o Metadata might not really be the problem
          o Chemistry is very structure centric, so searching by 
structures is needed (by wholes or fragments) 
    * pointers from wikipedia to CKAN for references?
          o but WP is not a place for lists (actively discouraged) 
    * workshop on finding opendata in chemistry? next steps, etc
          o Participants: send to blueobelisk list and the Chemistry WP 
group
          o Martin Walker (Wikipedia), Blue Obelisk List (Egon 
Willighagen, Noel O'Boyle) 
    * getting participation from the people who submitted the datasets
          o wrt format (xml, rdf) 
    * Can we provide the equivalent of Open Shakespeare for undergrad 
chemistry students?
    * Existing Chemistry packages:
          o  http://ckan.net/package/search?q=chemistry&search=Search+Packages+%C2%BB
          o  http://ckan.net/group/chemistry 
    *

      ChemSpider:
          You have limited rights in this regard. You can only assemble a 
database of 5000 structures or less, and their associated properties, 
from our database without our permission. You can download up to 1000 
structures per day from the website. Please contact us at 
feedbackATchemspiderDOTcom to request an extension outside this 
constraint. These constraints are under regular review so please feel 
free to engage us in conversation. 

          http://www.chemspider.com/FAQ.aspx 

Panton Principles Concensus

    * isitopen? use
    * go to the OA publishers to get stated support (start with the DOAJ)
    * Get grad students to lead the charge to contact publishers to adopt 
the principles (or support of)
          o Egon 
    * Blogosphere / Friendfeed 

Panton Discussions

    * get the geographically close people first (eg: Mark Patterson from 
PLoS)
          o  http://www.plos.org/about/people/publishing.php#mpatterson 
    * google docs with lists of people to include
          o shoot for 3 people for half an hour 
    * Great place for grad students/interns participation
          o recording, coordination, editing, publishing, creating the "I 
<3 PP" button 

Logo

    * Get the logo discussion going again on the list
    * do a "I Support the Panton Principles" button 

Unconference for Data

    * Wellcome support? JISC? RIN? EBI? Bio Med Central? Shuttleworth?
    * Main (Open)Data events:
          o Open Access-related meetings 
    * Time frame: Fall 2011. September. 


Report on "Archive '10 NSF Workshop on Archiving Experiments to Raise 
Scientific Standards"

Perhaps of interest to the group, last week I attended the above workshop 
at the computer science department at University of Utah. Details at the 
workshop web site http://users.emulab.net/trac/archive10/ The 
presentation I gave at the workshop is at http://punkish.org/651

Would be great to invite them to this list -- and to guest blog about
what they are doing!

  http://www.polarcommons.org/

Also what license will the data be under? Presume (and hope) CC0?

Hi Jonathan -

The Polar Information Commons is a data sharing project led by a number of
leaders in the field using data from the most recent International Polar
Year. There are 2 options for badging the IPY data -- public domain under
CC0 or CC-BY-3.0 where necessary.

I'd suggest contacting Mark Parsons at the National Snow and Ice Data Center
in Boulder, CO.

Best,
K

Jonathan, Kaitlin--

I'm already on the list. Wasn't planning to blog, but will try to 
coordinate with Mark P. to post some comments to the list later this 
week from Oslo (Mark is there already, I'm waiting for my flight!).

Peter,

I call your attention to one activity of the Open Geospatial  
Consortium (OGC): the GEOSS Architecture Implementation Pilot 3  
(AIP-3) data sharing activity: http://sites.google.com/a/aip3.ogcnetwork.net/home/home/aip-3-kickoff/data-sharing-guidelines 
  .

There are many in the OGC (http://www.opengeospatial.org) who share  
your concerns about climate data. OGC runs a consensus process in  
which government and private sector organizations collaborate to  
develop open interfaces and encodings that enable, among other things,  
sharing of geospatial data, including climate data. I think the OGC is  
likely to play an important role in the opening up of climate science.

I invite you to look through a presentation in which I gathered my  
learnings and musings about the importance, feasibility and  
inevitability of persistent and open publishing of scientific  
geospatial data: http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=37254 
  .

We've spent a lot of time on climate change and open science at Creative Commons. I have a personal interest, as my father is a climate change researcher and was an author on the most recent IPCC report. He and I co-wrote a paper on open innovation in sustainable development earlier this year which was OA, and the references for that paper are a good start for the non-data side of the problem. It's at http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/2/4/993/

In most cases in climate change science, impacts, and adaptive responses, the hurdles for open science are not intellectual property rights but scientific practices related to confidentiality and protecting one's own data and models - a different challenge. The current evaluation of iPCC being done by the Interacademy Council at the request of the UN is beginning to take a look at how such conventional scientific practices can become a threat to the perceived integrity of science. IP is a footnote in the debate, unlike in OA or in free software or in free culture. Our successes in these spaces have sadly conditioned us to look at "free" legal tools as our hammers, and see the world as a bunch of nails. It's a great irony actually. 

In the case of climate change mitigation, of course, the open science issues are similar to those in other areas of traditional manufactured technology - accentuated by the fact that the main drivers of increases in global GHG emissions are now in the larger developing countries, while the industrialized countries still control a lot of the intellectual property for addressing that problem....

In many ways the "open" debate about data fails to capture the reality of these issues. Making data open, even fully compliant with the Science Commons protocol, is actually far from enough. I hope that we can make these debates nuanced enough that we don't push "open" as the end game, because I can comply with the protocol, or with Panton, and still have my data be worthless from a scientific perspective. An extreme example would be that I publish PDFs of my data under PDDL, and claim the mantle of "open". If we as a community push "open" as the goal, and not "useful" as the goal, then we enable that outcome. 

Open climate science, at least as it regards data, is almost never an intellectual property problem. It's a culture problem, it's a technology problem (formats, ontologies, standards), and it's a language problem. It's a political problem, it's an incentive problem. Getting rid of the IP is no more than table stakes. And if we don't deal with the inventions - the technologies that both create climate problems and that promise to mitigate them in adaptation - then we won't be changing the world the way we want. That's a big part of why our science work has shifted to focusing significantly on patent licensing and materials transfer...

Thank you, John. This is a good statement of the problem by someone  
more immersed in the issue than I am.

I've skimmed the paper you wrote with your father, and I'm excited to  
see that you are looking at sustainability through some of the same  
disciplinary lenses I am interested in but don't understand well. When  
I read it more carefully, I'll be looking for ties to the little I  
know about "regime change", items to feed or dispell my gloom about  
Schumpeter's seldom-noted prediction of the end of creative  
destruction (monopolies win in the end), and implications for  
sustainability of the "beyond-Metcalf's Law" network laws in Ogle's  
"Smart World": 1) the law of tipping points, 2) the law of the fit get  
rich, 3) the law of the fit get fitter, 4) the law of spontaneous  
generation, 5) the law of navigation, 6) the law of hotspots, 7) the  
law of small worlds networks, 8) the law of integration, 9) the law of  
minimal effort.

Thanks for your reply.

Lance

Thanks for this John --
In recent months, I have been speaking (UCB, UCDavis, CalTech) on the theme
"Data as Evidence" -- my intention is to broaden our concerns -- as you do
in your comment...  In using this terminology I am attempting to co opt the
force of argument for "evidence-based" policy...

Respecting terminology, I have been (in the biodiversity community) using
the rubric of "free, open and *effective* " access and use of data. I think
"*effective*" is perhaps better than "*useful*" because it is less
value-laden (?) and implies support for the ability to take and use, to test
and evaluate and validate -- these are actions *assumed to be necessary* as
a part of scientific practice but far too rarely actually practiced.

( Of course *observational* data (as opposed to *experimental *data) pose
problems in that they represent discrete, unique events -- that are by
definition not replicable?  This is where we must rely on both the scope  of
sampling geographically and chronologically ("longitudinally") to evaluate
anomalies.

The import of my focus on "evidence" is that *data are evidential* both in
the *logic of science* and in the *political process of policy formation and
decision making* -- though, I believe that different standards of proof
apply scientifically (where the notion of probability and levels of
confidence apply) and politically -- where I believe something more like the
Anglo-American legal standard of *reasonable doubt* has force (particularly
where acceptance of scientific projections has huge implications for vested
economic power and wealth -- as in the case of climate change).

In my view the special burden that we assume when we move from the *realm of
scientific discourse *to the *realm of political discourse* is created by
problems of scientific literacy in the body politic *and* by the difficulty
many scientists have in formulating their scientific hypotheses in ways that
are readily understandable. (Scientists are, in one sense, rewarded for
their ability to conduct esoteric discourse...)

I believe that the "problem set" we face is something like this:

-- Clear and rigorous expression of the logic of scientific investigation
(including logically supportable alternative hypotheses)
-- Rigorous definition of the evidence that is deemed sufficient to support
one or another hypothesis.
-- Definition of the specific forms of data that provide this  evidence
[At the American Museum of Natural History, a paper was published a few
years ago that in my opinion is a good indicator of how this should be done
SEE: RS Voss and L Emmons,  ?Mammalian diversity in Neotropical lowland
rainforests : a preliminary assessment.?  Bulletin of the AMNH ; no. 230
[New York] : American Museum of Natural History, 1996. -- It's freely
available at teh AMNH Library DSpace site  --
http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/1671 ]
-- Rigorous definition of the methodology -- including apparatus,
calibrations, competence -- necessary to obtain data
-- Rigorous documentation of the actual data collection (I believe that this
can be expressed using work flow applications like Kepler...?)
-- Documentation of the data management procedures -- including capture,
storage, transformations -- this is broadly the issue of lineage and
provenance (many statistical packages including automated "scripting" that
captures this information)
-- publicly intelligible representation of the data (and of all the
preceding documentation)
-- clear argumentation on the basis of this evidence in favor of one or
alternative policies with appropriate risk assessments

Many of these elements are in place (or under development) but they are not
(to my knowledge) coherently expressed as required practice...?

I believe that, at the very least, for certain *canonical *data sets
[Climate Change???] we have an absolute obligation to satisfy these
requirements...

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">In the last ten years, a collection of burgeoning movements has begun the herculean task of overhauling the outmoded institutions and worldviews that make up our global scientific governance system.

<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">Open Access Journals have demonstrated a new path for publishing that utilizes the power of the internet to instantly distribute ideas instead of imposing artificial scarcity to prop up old business models. ?Health 2.0? entrepreneurs are seeking to apply the lessons of e-commerce to empower patients.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">However, these different efforts are each working on a piece of the problem without a view of the whole.?It is not sufficient or realistic to tweak one component of the innovation system (eg, patent policy) and assume the others stay static.

<p style="text-align: left;"><font face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2">The Open Science Summit is the first and only event to consider what happens throughout the entire innovation chain as reform in one area influences the prospects in others.

Hello,
Can I ask for any news/information and OKF relevant updates to be sent my way for inclusion in the upcoming OKF newsletter?

This might be an item relevant to 'in brief' news, ie. a couple of sentences synopsis is fine; or it may be more comprehensive information about OKF recent activities (eg. the Bibliographica project) or recent open data activities and initiatives you've been involved in ? in which case send me full details or URLS so I can re-write/edit/summarise as appropriate.

The more information the better: so send me what you've got in the first instance (no matter how small/insignificant an activity/outcome it may seem to be) so it can be whittled down from there. As usual, newly-discovered and useful URL/links to showcase are also appreciated.

Please send to me by: the week beginning Monday 28th June in order to ensure inclusion.


Thanks!

We should probably mention something about the upcoming
paper/presentation at scipy2010. Jonathan et al., sorry for my

Scientists for open data and authors of Panton Principles named SPARC Innovators

Washington, DC ? Science is based on building on, reusing, and openly
criticizing the published body of scientific knowledge. For science to
effectively function, and for society to reap the full benefits from
scientific endeavors, it is crucial that science data be made open.

That?s the belief of four leaders who have put forth a groundbreaking
set of recommendations for scientists to more easily share their data
? The Panton Principles ? and who have been named the latest SPARC
Innovators for their work.

The authors of The Panton Principles are:

? ? ? ? Peter Murray-Rust, chemist at the University of Cambridge;
? ? ? ? Cameron Neylon, biochemist at the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory in Didcot, England;
? ? ? ? Rufus Pollock, co-founder of the Open Knowledge Foundation and
Mead Fellow in Economics, Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge;
? ? ? ? John Wilbanks, vice president for Science, Creative Commons,
San Francisco.

The authors advocate making data freely available on the Internet for
anyone to download, copy, analyze, reprocess, pass to software or use
for any purpose without financial, legal or technical barriers.
Through the Principles, the group aimed to develop clear language that
explicitly defines how a scientist?s rights to his own data could be
structured so others can freely reuse or build on it. The goal was to
craft language simple enough that a scientist could easily follow it,
and then focus on doing science rather than law.

The Panton Principles were publicly launched in February of 2010, with
a Web site at www.pantonprinciples.org to spread the word and an
invitation to endorse. About 100 individuals and organizations have
endorsed the Principles so far.

?This is the first time we?re seeing diverse viewpoints crystallize
around the pragmatic idea that we have to start somewhere, agree on
the basics, and set the tone,? says Heather Joseph, Executive Director
of SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition).
?The authors are all leading thinkers in this area ? as well as
producers and consumers of data. They each approached the idea of open
data from different directions, yet with the same drive to open up
science, and ended up on common ground.?

According to Pollock, ?It's commonplace that we advance by building on
the work of colleagues and predecessors ? standing on the shoulders of

To read the full June 2010 SPARC Innovator profile, visit
http://www.arl.org/sparc/innovator.

The SPARC Innovator program recognizes advances in scholarly
communication propelled by an individual, institution, or group.
Typically, these advances exemplify SPARC principles by challenging
the status quo in scholarly communication for the benefit of
researchers, libraries, universities, and the public. SPARC Innovators
are featured on the SPARC Web site semi-annually and have included the
Optical Society of America, R. Preston McAfee; Harvard University FAS;
student leaders; and others. SPARC Innovators are selected by the
SPARC staff in consultation with the SPARC Steering Committee.

Individuals can nominate their colleagues as potential SPARC
Innovators at http://www.arl.org/sparc/innovator/nominate.html.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimC7ktrT1ZFO1AlTt6Y-NiZyNtJq0fJCtk7zluG@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

William Stein, Fernando Perez, and I are founding a non-profit
foundation for mathematical and scientific research computing. Our
purpose is to ensure unrestricted access to the best computational
tools for research and education in mathematics, science, and
engineering. Our aim is to do this primarily by fostering existing
efforts and communities. The foundation will initially focus on
Python, rather than other languages for scientific computing such as R
or Scilab. Despite this initial focus on Python, the foundation's
mission will not be merely to promote the use of Python in science.

Please join us for our first event on June 25th at the Mathematical
Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, CA. The workshop is
free and lunch is provided. In order to make sure that we have enough
food, we are requiring anyone who wants to attend to RSVP by the end
of the day Wednesday, June 23rd by sending an email to
jarrod.millman+orcp2010 at gmail.com.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

CODATA and its partners are delighted to announce the successful
Launch of the Polar Information Commons at the IPY Oslo Science
Conference in June. The event was officially launched by Professor
Steven Chown, recipient at the conference of the prestigious Martha T.
Muse award, Director of the Centre for Invasion Biology and a
Professor in the Department of Botany and Zoology at Stellenbosch
University.



The launch was attended by approximately 100 people and the Polar
Information Commons (PIC) booth was visited by many dignitaries
throughout the week, including HRH Crown Prince Haakon of Norway and
HSH Prince Albert II of Monaco.



For photos of this and the event we invite you to visit the PIC photo gallery on

http://www.polarcommons.org/oslo-photo-gallery.php



The occasion was marked by the cutting of the PIC birthday cake by Kim
Jochum, who represented the Association of Polar Early Career
Scientists - the next generation of researchers who will take
responsibility for continuing the momentum of IPY and polar research.



The Launch of PIC was only one of many events and presentations that
took place during the week whose focus was polar data issues. Among
other presentations were:



Implementing a Data Management System capable of supporting Antarctic
science, SCAR activities within the Antarctic Treaty System, and
contributing to the data legacy of the IPY: Kim Finney, Manager
Australian Antarctic Data Centre.



Freeing Data through the Polar Information Commons: CODATA Secretary
General, Robert Chen, on behalf of Taco F de Bruin, NIOWZ, Royal
Netherlands Institute for Sea Research.



State of Polar Data: Mark Parsons, National Snow and Ice Data Centre, USA.

The International Polar Year Metadata Portal: A Gateway to Discovery
of Data and Services Resulting from the IPY Field Period. Stephanie
Grebas, Global Change Master Directory

The full program can be found on http://ipy-osc.no/osc_programme

On Thursday 10th of June, relevant stakeholders gathered to discuss
the development of the PIC post Oslo. A number of small working groups
will be established to address governance, legal, outreach,
technological and data stewardship issues as the PIC evolves.



Check http://www.polarcommons.org over the coming months as events
develop or contact the CODATA secretariat at codata at dial.oleane.com



Finally we would like to thank the IPY Program office for their
support in facilitating the activities and in particular the PIC
Booth!

Subject: [open-science] [Funny]Speed of Light in Super Computer..?
Message-ID: <f3e0da3e2e016621ec26d2982aa4cc84@a51160>

Hi, I'm a student who loves physcis very much, and philosophy.
 
And did you guys saw the movie Matrix? I saw whole series of it!
 
Ever since i saw that fantastic movie, I cannot stop to think about it further.
 
And thesedays I suspended that the speed of light might be the speed of the process of a great powerful computer! (in the logic of Matrix)
 
First, let me suppose that this reality we are living is just an online game that the characters you control running around. And suppose that
 
the problem happens on the internet process of server, then the whole characters will go slower than before but, since whole characters and the clients are
 
bound to the process of the computer, all the characters are disadvanteged at speeding 
 
by the internet problem. And for the characters, nothing happens because they cannot
 
feel the processing speed of server while they might feel the speed of the other monsters and other characters.
 
And If they got a spell 'teleportation', they can teleport to random space. But the speed of teleportation is bound to the processing speed. So 
 
Even though the player put the magic on the charater to speed more, since the absolute speed is bound to the server's process, the character's speed cannot
 
proceed the speed of teleportation equal to the processing speed!
 
HAHAHAHAHA!
 
Is it wonderful idea??
 
If there is any people who are interested in these funny idea
 
please don't hesitate to express your idea just email me!

Yes, I think that would be a good idea. Make sure to add a note that
the English one is normative. It would also be useful to add some
guidelines then how people can add additional translations, including
where to send it etc

A question from Libby Bishop at the UK Data Archive...

Would be most interested to hear responses to this!

Jonathan

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Hello,

I am trying to establish which, if any "Open" organisations explicitly
endorse open (public/free) access to data.

I have read through the Panton Principles which seem to be the
clearest, strongest statement of openness of which I am aware.
However, in the FAQ, it says that the PP have not been formally
adopted by OSI, FSF, or EFF.

Moreover, according to Stevan Harnand and his recent posts on the
American Scientist Open Access forum, OA advocates only open access to
publications, but not research data.

Here at UKDA, we advocate free access to data for non-commercial use.
However, the nature of some social science data, especially
qualitative data, (confidentiality promises made, sensitive data,
disclosure risks) obligates us to share data via a licence so that
those "reusing" data do not violate the conditions and terms of use
specified by the data depositor.

In sum, it sounds as though there is at least some variation among
diverse "open" initiatives as to what extent data per se should be
public and free.? Is this statement correct?? Any details you can add
would be greatly appreciated.

Kind regards,

Libby

I don't know whether this is consensus within OA but whether it is or
not doesn't really matter IMO since clearly open data is important in
its own right (and potentially even more important than simple OA to
the fulltext)

We really need a FAQ relating to confidentiality etc (we had one
started but I don't think it reached consensus ...). Basically, my
feeling here is that where there are good reasons (such as
confidentiality) where the data cannot be generally released then the
PP don't apply. However, once you are releasing data generally (e.g.
as must be the case where release the data under an NC license) the PP
do apply.

Thus my main comment to UKDA would be: remove the NC restriction --
non-commercial restrictions and confidentiality issues are completely
orthogonal so let's not confuse them.

That's likely given the wide-ranging views on any topic ...

Libby,
Many thanks for your enquiry which is now on the open-science list at OKF. I
am one of the 4 authors of the PP

This is an excellent endeavour and the more people and organizations
involved the more comprehensive we hope we can become.

That's partly because I don't think they have been formally asked, and
partly because the PP cover data rather than code - although clearly
related. If these orgs wish to endorse the PP obviously that would be good.

PP covers data, OA covers (mainly) scholarly publishing or journals,
articles, and some monographs. In practice they are largely distinct.

It can be argued that an OA publication that uses a CC-BY or similarly
strong libre licence also covers the data in the publication. We saw
considerable problems with that approach and that is why an explict
PP-compliant statement on data should also be made.

In practice we would expect that publishers who publish journals licensed
through CC-BY (or similar) are likely to be enthusiastic proponents of
PP-compliant labelling of the data in, or associated with, the publication.
The problem comes with weaker licences such as CC-NC or with self-archiving
where no formal permissions are given.

In practice in science several publishers expose data associated with
closed-access publications. We hope that the community can persuade them to
label them as PP-compliant. For this we have created a tool to ask the
publishers (or any other data providers) if their data are PP-compliant (see
http://www.isitopendata.org/ )

There is great variation, some of which is unavoidable but a lot of which
can be eliminated by spreading the word and the tools. It's worth continuing
to follow the open-science list and asking questions :-)

Could you please elaborate your reasoning behind your decision to restrict use of data to non-commercial use (assuming the original depositor has not put any such condition, and assuming there are no privacy issues).

I continue to be puzzled and befuddled by open access advocates continuing to push and peddle non-commercial restrictions, as if non-commercial is virtuous. Why? Why the distrust and dislike of things commercial?

Speaking as someone who agreed such a restriction in the past, as the then Director of the Digital Curation Centre: we had an obligation to pursue "sustainability" as an explicit part of our funding conditions. On that basis, we decided that our default licence would be CC-BY-NC-SA. Our reasoning was that if there was money to be made from our resources, our sustainability obligation meant we had to try to be part of it. Putting a NC restriction doesn't mean "no commercial use, ever". It means "no commercial use unless you discuss with us the terms and conditions".

In the 5 years or so I was part of the DCC I think this only caused us a problem a couple of times. From memory once we agreed with no conditions (the use was pretty much equivalent to academic use), and once we agreed terms that would allow the author to earn significant royalties before a cut was due to us. I need hardly say we have as yet received nothing, as far as I know.

This is of course mostly in a text-based context. I'm not clear in my own mind in relation to data, on whether the barrier to re-use of any kind of licence (including BY and NC) can fully outweigh the need to strive for sustainability. However, I do remember investigations into Crown Copyright etc, well before the current openness regime, that suggested that only Ordnance Survey made any significant (5 figures or higher) annual returns on IP exploitation, as well as experiences from the eLib programme that misguided sustainability approaches led to potentially valuable resources being locked away. Which is all tending to make me think that commercially exploitable IPR in data will be comparatively rare, and therefore the default view SHOULD be for greater openness. 

It would help if there were a more automated approach to the data citation problem since then one could at least demonstrate impact more easily, even if not sustainability!

I wonder if your UK Met Office hasn't some income from selling data?

If I understand a report correctly (http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/aar_08.pdf) I 
see that 'Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut' has an income on around 50 
million DDK (~7 million Euro) 'selling goods and services'. That is around 
20% of their total income. Processed data costs 0.75 DDK per parameter 
(0.1 Euro).

Fair enough. Nothing wrong with wanting to make money, if only to support oneself.

Our reasoning was that if there was money to be made from our resources, our sustainability obligation meant we had to try to be part of it. Putting a NC restriction doesn't mean "no commercial use, ever". It means "no commercial use unless you discuss with us the terms and conditions".

Ahh... that dreaded SA, another seemingly virtuous condition -- "do as I do" because, heck, I know best. But, that is another issue. 

Back to the point -- yes, all CC licenses have a "waiver" clause whereby any and all of the license conditions can be waived if permission is asked first. But, why not make that clear right up front? Isn't it better to say "Do what you want OR if you are going to make money with my data, share the wealth"?

Personally, I think one should be either in the "give data away" or "make money from data" business... one or the other, or both, but with a clean line between the two. As clean as possible. As little confusion as possible.

Only have a moment but a quick response. The core argument on this point
revolves around the issue of the opportunity costs involved in a) having NC
licences and b) not acting as a catalyst to persuade _others_ to _not_ use
NC licences vs the potential income to be generated.

Overall for government data it has been shown in many situations that the
net community return on giving data away is greater than that when you try
and sell it. In several cases it has been shown that more money is made by
the providers in question when they give data away. The best demonstrator of
this has been the big database companies in the US are more profitable than
EU ones despite (or perhaps because of) EU database rights.

Of course these things are hard to estimate but to the extent that it is
true it is reasonable to expect it to be _more_ true for data than for other
objects (like text) which don't gain much more value in aggregate in the way
data does.

The sad truth is that while many people feel "if anyone is going to make
money on this then we should" the reality is that no-one ends up making any
money at all. Where we are talking about public investment focussing on
sustainability can actually be a barrier to maximising ROI which is the true
route to ultimate sustainability because it means that value is being
created which will ultimately support further creation (and curation).

Will try to respond to the original query in a bit more detail later.

Well put. Prisoner's dilemma, and all that.

There are some important features of NC or SA which don't apply to CC-BY,
etc.

* You cannot use the data for a "commercial" purpose without asking a human.
Robots cannot make this decision. Therefore if you wish to use 1000 bits of
fragmented data, you may have to ask 1000 questions.
* a significant proportion of those 1000 humans will not reply. They are
under no obligation to do so. In fairness they may just be too busy
* it is a matter of opinion what is "commercial".
 - including in a textbook? YES
 - including in a newspaper article you get paid for? YES
 - providing professional services? YES
 - including it in an article published by a COMMERCIAL publisher? surely
YES. (they will gain revenue from this)
 - including it in an article published in a closed access non-profit
journal? I'd say YES for the same reason

So the re-use of NC data can be very limited. At every stage you have to ask
questions.

I agree there is a slight element of prisoner's dilemma in CC-BY. You are
giving away your value so someone else can profit. But if you are brave
then  it's likely that new markets will arise and you will be very well
placed.

If I were a Met Office, for example, I would grow my market on the quality
and reliability of my products, not on a monopoly. That's easy for me to
say, but there are examples where giving away increases sales.

Elizabeth,

I'm at your disposal if you'd ever like to chat in real time, and commend you on your work to release data. It's an unfortunate side effect to a robust movement and debate that it's far too easy to jump on those who don't "comply" with our requirements without first saying "huzzah." I'm often guilty of this :-)

I think there are at least three issues tangled up in here, which I will try to detangle.  I will be cross-posting this to my blog in some version, but this is a bit stream of consciousness. Apologies for length, but this is vital to get right.

The first is, "how successful are the principles?" - which is implicit in your question of who is "adopting" them. The second is the interaction of legal tools around intellectual property with other rights related to human subjects data. And the third is sustainability of data archives, which creates an incentive to contemplate "monetization" of data and/or use of tools that reserve commercial rights.

I'll try to speak to each, but I'm speaking for myself here, not presuming to speak for the list or the other authors of the Panton Principles. Indeed it's fair to say that Rufus and I have very different positions on some of these topics, as most folks around here know :-)

But that actually is related to the first issue. The principles are already a success to me, because the audience for them in many ways is the group of people who were trying to understand how some of the leaders in open data could reconcile the philosophical differences that naturally emerge in a decentralized movement. The differences of opinion inside open data were strong enough to be creating waves, and those waves could have been exploited by forces *outside* the open data world against us. Although I have a lively debate with Rufus and others on these issues, they're issues to us of how best to share, and the true threat to sharing regimes is from non-commons models. Panton to me is a spirited proof that we can put differences aside and agree on how to work together in a commons. 

"Adoption" to me is often a red herring. The organizations you cite in your email don't actually make data - so getting them to sign on is not my priority. And getting organizations to "sign on" in general isn't my priority - I'm trying to get organizations to "release data"! Thus I would point to GSK's recent use of CC0, the Polar Information Commons' formation and commitment to the public domain, rather than to signatories to a web page. There are more than a dozen OA declarations and thousands of signatories to them, but the relevant number is 16%, which is the amount of literature that is actually OA. My personal focus is on getting foundations that invest in science to implement public domain terms as relate to IPRs in their funding agreements, which is PP compliant, but isn't about encouraging orgs to sign the principles as a declaration. In my experience getting a signature can actually release the pressure to *do something* about the data - one can say one has signed, and do nothing.

The second issue is related to the rationale we've long held at Creative Commons about data in science (whether social or "hard" science), which is that the public domain creates the least interoperability problems. Issues of confidentiality, privacy, and human subjects protection are subject to a large, complex, and often contradictory set of legal regimes that are not internationally harmonized like copyright, and that are rapidly being overwhelmed by the advance of technological progress. The success of the folks who broke the Netflix data by re-identifying the people through cross-reference to other publicly available data is a good example of this - the Netflix data itself was de-identified, but it turns out that a few smart folks with lots of processor power can cross-reference to other movie review databases and bang, identify people uniquely.

There is a very real risk of conflict between "licensing" and the sorts of good citizen regimes that need to be implemented to share this kind of sensitive data. We're grinding away on these issues at CC, between our work with the Sage Commons, some emerging clean energy commons efforts, and climate change projects in which citizens gather data on air quality via their cell phones. Copyright is tough enough to deal with, but when one adds in unique sui generis database rights and contracts, it gets nearly untenable, which is why three years ago we recommended the public domain as a solution - it leaves one in a situation where the only issues to be dealt with are privacy and technical formats..."only" being a relative term of course. Otherwise, it's easy to see a world where there are multiple contradictory requirements imposed on users and re-users of data, where there is a contract to protect privacy, a contract to mandate share alike, a database right trigger, and a copyright trigger *even if all four were simply in support of attribution*. 

There is also the very real issue of technology as regards any licensing based on copying. As the semantic web becomes a reality, and data gets bigger, the need and the desire to make copies decreases. Thus, anything based on copying is likely to fade in power over time - because we'll simply all run federated queries. But that's another email. 

My instinct is that the right way to share human subjects data (until we reach a cultural shift where there is non discrimination legislation and where people "own" their own data, rather than Facebook owning their data) is through a tiered stack of services and data provision, where the IP status is public domain, but where there is some norms encoding and liability to prevent abuse. That encoding might be through aggressive statistical "jittering" of data to de-identify it, it might be through some of the "differential privacy" techniques that allow service-based access to data or homomorphic encryption to allow for algorithmic access to sensitive data without its unencryption, or it might be through more classical approaches of request-based access to human subjects data, but lowering the transaction costs through the standardization of the various legal tools around the request and granting. We're looking at all of these here in real world situations and would be happy to provide you with some information if that's of interest. There are no easy answers.

The third issue is one of sustainability. It's non trivial. But we should look at the realities of data. Selling data that isn't marketing data isn't big business. And every transaction cost imposed on the re-use of data is likely to decrease its net value over time, because it limits the conversion of data into a platform for services and applications. The opening of data is not like the building of e-commerce storefronts. It's like laying the foundations for the internet in the 1970s and 1980s. Open data is a long way away from the world of the web, where small transactions can add up to real money. It's in a far more protean state, one that needs standards and boring technical efforts, one that awaits a sea change in science culture, one that needs entirely new technologies (as new to us today as the web browser was in the mid 1970s, and as difficult to conceive - but hopefully not as far away!).

Sustainability is a challenge that will require new business models, new cultures, good ideas in curation, and more than anything, funder commitment. It's not going to be solved via legal tools. I'd beware of any magic pixie dust license that promises sustainability via non-commercial terms. To the extent that NC terms work in my own experience, it's for individuals who want their songs and photos online without exploitation - and we don't, for the most part, turn songs and photos into the basis of new research. We don't federate songs and photos (again, for the most part!) for automated database query. Thus we shouldn't apply the same legal tools. 

The public domain is not an easy decision. But it is a *simple* decision. And that, in the end, is the point. It's the only way to make a murderously complicated issue - intellectual property rights around data - simple enough that we can begin to address the other murderously complicated issues that *don't have a simple solution available*.

On that basis, we decided that our default licence would be CC-BY-NC-SA. Our reasoning was that if there was money to be made from our resources, our sustainability obligation meant we had to try to be part of it. Putting a NC restriction doesn't mean "no commercial use, ever". It means "no commercial use unless you discuss with us the terms and conditions".

From memory once we agreed with no conditions (the use was pretty much equivalent to academic use), and once we agreed terms that would allow the author to earn significant royalties before a cut was due to us. I need hardly say we have as yet received nothing, as far as I know.

I'm not clear in my own mind in relation to data, on whether the barrier to re-use of any kind of licence (including BY and NC) can fully outweigh the need to strive for sustainability. However, I do remember investigations into Crown Copyright etc, well before the current openness regime, that suggested that only Ordnance Survey made any significant (5 figures or higher) annual returns on IP exploitation, as well as experiences from the eLib programme that misguided sustainability approaches led to potentially valuable resources being locked away. Which is all tending to make me think that commercially exploitable IPR in data will be comparatively rare, and therefore the default view SHOULD be for greater openness.
