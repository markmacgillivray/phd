The IPCC report (

) was published in draft yesterday
WORKING GROUP I CONTRIBUTION TO THE IPCC FIFTH ASSESSMENT REPORT
CLIMATE CHANGE 2013: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS

This is a critically important document for the human race. Yet how much of
the science is Open? How accessible is it?

One immediate concern is that many of the 9000+ references are closed. Can
we highlight this concern , e.g. by Crowdcrafting the analysis of the
references? How many are closed? How much would it cost a concerned citizen
(or group of citizens) to read all the references?

Hi Peter, Media Lab Science Po is doing a study on IPCC contributors
http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/ipcc/
I just forward your email to them, I imagine/hope they could help if we
want to do a study on the openess of IPCC references.
I think this would be a great and powerful project, and I would be happy to
help.

Brilliant,
I have just downloaded the report (2000+ pages) and I think we could easily
abstract the references (9000+). Then we could create a simple
crowdcrafting app.
"Here is a reference" - can you find it in Google? Can you read the paper
it points to? if not, what does it cost?
My guess is that it would cost me 50-100,000 USD (to download the papers
referenced. It would be great to have that figure.

P.

Hi all,

as I was pleased to learn at OKCon, there are quite a lot of Web Science people among the OKFN Open Science crowd. The chairs for the Web Science 2014 conference are currently asking for ideas for the conference. I pitched open data and open peer review, and they seem to be inclined to adopt an open data policy. If you want to show your support for this idea, or post a different one, please comment on this blog post:

Message-ID: <mailman.147.1380633294.3063.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Call for Workshops ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-workshops

The organizers of the 11th ESWC 2014 cordially invite you to submit a workshop proposal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and Linked Data, attracting a high number of high quality submissions and participants from academia and industry alike.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points for discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantic technologies and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technology of general interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of workshop proposals on:
 
Fundamental problems of the Semantic Web / Linked Data such as ontology mining, heterogeneity, scalability and distribution, uncertainty, etc.
Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the Semantic Web, and
Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far, 
Techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research (e.g., machine learning, NLP, data mining)

General Information and Criteria 
Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the local and the general chair of ESWC 2014.
 
The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:
 
Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC conference.
Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-conferences.
We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application.
There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's topic.
Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
We strongly advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.
 
In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the overall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less than 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early registration deadline might be canceled.
 
The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers), and proceedings production. They will be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chair and the ESWC 2014 local organizers to finalize all organizational details. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for workshops and tutorials at the pre-conference days, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fee.

A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, the workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, hacking session, or general discussion, and and an approximate timeline.
A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day event.
Related Workshops and Conferences: Is this the continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop to address an emerging issue? Please provide information about past versions of this workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
Names and contact information of the workshop organizers/chair(s) (name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the workshop including past experience in organizing/facilitating workshops).

Message-ID: <mailman.148.1380645719.3063.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Call for Tutorials ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-tutorials

ESWC 2014 invites tutorials that address the interests of its varied audience: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web researchers and practitioners that wish to learn new technologies, users of Semantic Web technologies, and representatives of government and funding agencies as well as potential private investors in Semantic Web technologies. We welcome submissions of tutorial proposals on all major topics related to semantic technologies.

We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:

- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new semantic technologies and trends.
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in specific domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce, cultural heritage, etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research especially in relationship to the tracks of the conference (e.g., techniques from social science, database techniques, NLP techniques etc.).

Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.

We advise having more than one presenter and no more than three, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the tutorial topic.

Tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects; however, we encourage organisers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The tutorials should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its relevance to the community.    

Timeline for Tutorials
-----------
Proposals due: Nov 22, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Notification of acceptance: Dec 6, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial Web site due: Dec 16, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Camera-ready material due: Apr 25, 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial days: May 25 and May 26, 2014

Responsibilities
-----------
Organizers of accepted tutorials are responsible for preparing and maintaining a Web site that describes the tutorial and includes all relevant information. Organizers are also responsible for submitting the material for attendees (slide sets, additional teaching material, software installation and usage guides for practical hands-on sessions, etc.) to the Tutorial Chair. The ESWC 2014 Organizing Committee is responsible for providing publicity for the tutorials as part of the conference publicity activities, and on-site logistical support to the organizers and attendees. Tutorial attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.


General Information
-----------
Each tutorial will have one reduced registration fee (pre-conference days registration will be free i.e. one of the chairs will only have to pay the main conference fees).
In the interest of the overall quality of the conference, the Tutorial Chair reserves the right to merge tutorials and/or adjust the scope thereof in case a mimimum number of registrations is not reached by the early registration deadline.

Submission details
-----------
Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages, using an 11 pt font for the body of the text of the proposal and should contain the following information:

- Abstract (200 words maximum, for inclusion on the ESWC 2014 website).

- Tutorial description: More specifically, it should specify the objectives of the tutorial and relevance to ESWC 2014, include enough details on the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered and specify the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge. Appropriate references to the material to be covered by the tutorial must be included.

- Tutorial length. The tutorial can be full or half day (if the tutorial can be either length, please be sure to identify which material is included for each length).

- Specify other venues to which the tutorial or part thereof has or will be presented, in addition to explaining how the current tutorial differs from the other editions. Links to the slides of those tutorial editions should be included in the proposal.

- Brief professional biography of the presenter(s) indicating previous training and speaking experience (such as teaching and tutorial presentation).

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the tutorial programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the tutorial's fit to the conference. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal. 

Submission
-----------
Submission will be through the Easychair system (please note that it is the same site to submit workshops and tutorials)  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials

Hi Peter
thanks a lot for the answer and for the explanations.
I fully agree with you. My thoughts fall more in the open knowledge
category. I will try to find my way in OKF and identify which group will
reflect more my ideas and where I can contribute the most. I am still
trying to get more informed and have a clearer path on how to transform
some of the thoughts I have been developing in the past year in actions.
The idea of a hack day is great and I will look into CrowdCrafting app....I
never heard about it but will look into it right away!
Thanks a lot!!!

Simone

I am hacking this on the train and will hope to extract all the references
"RSN". Then I'd like us to feed them into Crowdcrafting.

Hey Stefan

Great idea!
David Osimo had a call around for these at the start of the year so his
spreadsheet might be a start
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7ILf5BATiJdHBzZ3JDdjRaTGtmQUE0M3gtSHVfZ1E#gid=0
The suggestion was made at the time to set up a website
opensciencestories.org to feature some of these, how were you thinking of
publishing them and what do you think of that idea?

Would anyone on the list with a writing/social media background be keen to
get involved?

Jenny

Hi everyone,

Peter's idea for crowdcrafting this problem is good indeed. All you have
to, if possible, is to extract as Peter has said the references, and then
convert each of them into a task in a CrowdCrafting.org app.

From there you can start asking whatever you like. Peter, I think you can
talk to Ross Mounce and re-use part of the code he and I created for Open
Access Journals <http://crowdcrafting.org/app/oajournals/> as your goal it
is pretty similar and the app is more or less done :-)

If you need help, let me know it.

All the best,

Daniel

Great,
I'll probably try to hack bits of the report today.

The way I see it is something like:

* Crowdcrafting is given 9000 references:
* Each citizen is given a reference. and asked "can you read this"
* they are expected to paste the text into Google or some other search
engine (maybe Microsoft Academic Search)
* they click questions such as "is this paper on a public site?" "is it the
publisher site?" "can you access the full-text?" "if not, how much does it
cost?" "please save the URL"

and repeat.  It's up to our app to keep track of the results.

There's slightly more cut and paste than normal, but many citizens should
have high motivation. My guess it will take about 0.5-3 mins. We may need
notes on how to navigate some journals. Their interfaces are awful.

We also need a wiki/mail - e.g. how do we find the cost for Journal X...

I think it could be exciting, rapid and very worthwhile.

P.

In the application I mentioned before, I basically avoid the copy&paste
action by giving a button that will directly do the search in Google
Scholar in a new tab. You can adapt it easily to any service :-)

It makes a lot of sense :-) Once the user has all that info, they will
click a button with the Save URL or Send report, and a new task will be
loaded for them.

Yep! You will be able to get all the answers via JavaScript, or if you
prefer, download them, do the statistics first, and then generate the
output. This is up to you to decide how do you want to achieve it.

That's something you can address in the tutorial. Every CrowdCrafting.org
application can have one, so all you have to do is to create one for yours
:-)

That's something CrowdCrafting does not have, but there should be free
Wikis or Etherpads to coordinate yourself.

Indeed! If promoted well, you will get a lot of people!

With ~9K searches, even a "fully automated" mechanism will be less than a rounding error for Google or Bing. I doubt if anyone there will give a rat's behind, not that I advocate violating any TOS ;-)

Hi,

In this case I would give it a try with DuckDuckGo as they have an
API,there are not low limits<https://duckduckgo.com/api>,
and you can do really interesting stuff :-)

More over, with the !bang solution we can even search directly in !mendeley
for example :-) Check this link <https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html>, scroll
down until you see Research.

Anyone with DuckDuckGo experience?

Cheers,

Danie

Subject: [open-science] Introducing myself and some things I work on
Message-ID: <A2FE8762EE55DB40BE770BE1FB0AA5ED10128CC4@DB3PRD0411MB429.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Dear all,

I have just subscribed to this mailing list. I briefly introduce myself. Sorry for cross-posting this first e-mail to open-science and open-access.

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the free University of Bozen-Bolzano (IT). My research interests include human aspects in empirical Software Engineering with psychological measurements, Web Engineering, and Open-{Access, Data, Source}.

I volunteered for the OKFN at the CKAN project (more specifically, datapkg/dpm and DataDeck) in the past. I sometimes try to help with some developing activities. However, as I started my PhD I began hitting paywalls, thus becoming more interested in Open Access and Open Science in general. I am exploring Open Access venues like the Journal of Open Research Software <http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com> and PeerJ <http://peerj.com>. Otherwise, I self-archive all of my research papers. Talking about self-archiving, I strive to advocate this practice, especially in Computer Science research. Incredibly, quite nobody knows about green Open Access there, nor on the right to self-archive.

I recently delivered a presentation at my faculty, called "What is self-archiving - and why should I care?" <http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.806275>. Additionally, I developed rchiveit, a Web tool to spread the awareness of self-archiving among researchers (in particular Computer Science researchers). It is nothing else than a wrapper around SHERPA/RoMEO APIs. However, it looks "fresher" and it tries to just get to the point, by displaying the minimum amount of information. It is live at <http://rchive.it>. The website contains some text on why researchers should self-archive. From some feedback received, I see that indeed, it is helping some people there. On the other hand, there is a lot of space for improvement.

I would like to get involved with the OKFN Open Science and Access working groups. I think that the best I can offer is my experience as a developer (especially Web developer) and as a Software Engineer (my MSc curricula). I would also love to help spreading OA awareness in CS and other fields.

Another idea would be to have the OKFN as an "incubator" for rchiveit, in order to attract some development.

I look forward to working with you towards a more transparent science.

I don?t know if this forum is the right place to discuss these details; maybe one should put up an EtherPad or Google Doc  to that effet. Anyway, I?ll go ahead.

I don?t have any concrete experience with crowdcrafting, only a knowledge derived from reading about some projects, mainly Galaxy Zoo, and I had a look at Ross Mounce?s app for OA journals copyright policies (a subject I know very well).

All I can say is that different people will come up with different answers to these questions; some will find an OA version, others won?t. And I know, because I do it on a regular basis for a journal, that OA versions are sometimes quite hard to find.

My point is that I don?t know what would be the quality of a survey in which each reference is checked by only one person. In Galaxy Zoo, for instance, they combine answers from many participants and empirically determined thresholds (number of participants and % of agreement) for an answer to be considered reliable (in their case, as reliable as what would be obtained by a trained astrophysicist).

Nice!


The way I see it is something like:
* Crowdcrafting is given 9000 references:
* Each citizen is given a reference. and asked "can you read this"
* they are expected to paste the text into Google or some other search engine (maybe Microsoft Academic Search)

In the application I mentioned before, I basically avoid the copy&paste action by giving a button that will directly do the search in Google Scholar in a new tab. You can adapt it easily to any service :-)
* they click questions such as "is this paper on a public site?" "is it the publisher site?" "can you access the full-text?" "if not, how much does it cost?" "please save the URL"

It makes a lot of sense :-) Once the user has all that info, they will click a button with the Save URL or Send report, and a new task will be loaded for them.


and repeat.  It's up to our app to keep track of the results.

Yep! You will be able to get all the answers via JavaScript, or if you prefer, download them, do the statistics first, and then generate the output. This is up to you to decide how do you want to achieve it.


There's slightly more cut and paste than normal, but many citizens should have high motivation. My guess it will take about 0.5-3 mins. We may need notes on how to navigate some journals. Their interfaces are awful.

That's something you can address in the tutorial. Every CrowdCrafting.org application can have one, so all you have to do is to create one for yours :-)


We also need a wiki/mail - e.g. how do we find the cost for Journal X...

That's something CrowdCrafting does not have, but there should be free Wikis or Etherpads to coordinate yourself.


I think it could be exciting, rapid and very worthwhile.

Indeed! If promoted well, you will get a lot of people!

Cheers,

Daniel

Actually that was suggested by Peter :-) And I like his proposal.

Well,  I think that as the first e-mail included this list, it is fair to
continue the discussion, unless someone says we should move to another
place :-)

IMHO this is also interesting :-) The perception of users regarding OA
versions could be something really good to analyze too. It would be cool to
show which references generated more disagreement regarding the chosen
licenses. For example, for our ForestWatchers.net project, we analyze the
disagreement for specific
tasks<http://forestwatchers.net/pybossa/app/besttile/>(check the map,
and select the Heat Map layer), and it reveals very useful
information: the most cloudy areas, are the most difficult ones.

You have raised a very good point: using only one user is bad, really bad.
For this reason, and by default, CrowdCrafting and any PyBossa server sends
an application task to at least 30 different persons, so you can do the
statistical analysis correctly.

PyBossa allows you to change that value, to have a bigger sample, or a
smaller one, but by default, if you do not touch anything you will get 30
samples per task. In other words, each task is going to be reviewed by 30
different people, so as you can see we are doing the same as Galaxy Zoo,
and other citizen science projects.

CrowdCrafting and PyBossa also supports "golden tasks" (in PyBossa terms I
called them calibration tasks) which means that you can weight the answer
of the users based on the answer given to the golden ones.

Thus, the application is covered by the server unless the authors decide to
change that value to something like one (i.e. for testing purposes). In
summary, CrowdCrafting follows the same pattern as GalaxyZoo.

I hope this is much clearer now :-)

Cheers,

Daniel

PS: PyBossa also supports task priorities, so you can change the priority
of apps as you wish.

Hi Cameron,

I think I talked to them in the past OKCon13 actually :-) In any case, you
are right! Your idea is really good! Interaction between both projects
should be something to discuss by all means. Peter, do you know this group?

Cheers,

Daniel

I know them well. They ran a hackathon last month with pizza etc. I've
blogged them. I am kicking myself I didn't make the connection! But hey!
that's why we have a collective approach to projects. I am copying them in.

And they were at C4CC hack / maker on Tuesday.

It's a wonderful synergy. Climate and Health are probably the two areas
that Citizens care most about. They have different public appeals. The
thing about Climate is it has a simple closure - we have 10000 references
and that's the immediate goal. So yes, getting the OA button technology
into analysing the climate references would be sensational!

Meanwhile I am looking to see how to extract the references automatically.
They won't be trivial to parse as there are references to a  number of
reports and chapters. But we should be able to poke something into Google
scholar or Microsoft academic.

P.

Hi Joe,

I think the connections with OAButton and CrowdCrafting have a lot of
possibilities. From my point of view, one that could be very useful for you
is the validation of reported closed papers/journals:

1.- A user reports a blocked paper with your tool.
2.- Your server stores that info, and automatically creates a task in a
CrowdCrafting app that you own.
3.- 30 (or more) people review that paper, so you can statistically
analyzed the answers regarding if it is closed or not.
4.- You get all the answers for that specific paper, validate them, and
publish them in your site as a story.

In the case of Peter's idea:

1.- The 9K references are created as tasks in a CrowdCrafting app.
2.- People answer all the questions that he wants to address, plus one that
is really relevant to your project.
3.- They gather all the answers, do the statistical analysis, and with the
conclusions automatically push that data to your platform.

If you want, they can include the button as part of the task. The idea is
to report directly to your platform which papers are not accessible from
CrowdCrafting.org. However, this may end up in generating too much noise
for you, as if I'm not mistaken you would like to have "validated
revisions". What do you think?

OAButton is a bookmarklet and when you have a reference you want to read it
brings up a form and populates it and you then add manual stuff and click
it to report. I'd be surprised if we couldn't use JS to glue the bits
together.

How long are you wanting this to take? We're under a lot of pressure

We don't want you to spend a millisecond longer . At present we'll see who
is interested in contributing. If none, no project. Else we need someone to
be the engine and maintain the primary resource (list of refs, and summary
of reports). Then we find out from you and Daniel what needs to be done.
Some Crowdcrafting apps are literally hours, I gather. My guess is that if
we have a driver then we can get inspiration from OAButton code - you
prepare the Google search. We will need to do the same. I think the
processes will be very similar. You populate your queries by communities
discovering problems - we shall feed problems into the community. Daniel
has software to do much of this.

Hi Daniel,

I agree validation is important - It's something we're missing at the
moment even in the main Open Access Button project.

With that in mind we could use the tool in a way which doesn't need
crowdcrafting, possibly like this:

1. A user reports a blocked *or open *paper with our tool. (All this
requires is change to our current form)
2. A server stores that info (I'd suggest storing this in a separate
database to our current one to avoid confusion)
3. People use the tool to go through the references (potentially on form
submit they state what reference they were hunting for). We'd then have a
event detailing the location of user, the url they were looking at, the
reference they were looking for and if it was open or not (+ anything else
asked in the form).
4. Our data set can be extracted and looked at fairly simply. You could
sort the data by reference and looking at agreement of users of whether
it's open or not.

At it's core the OAbutton can be used as a simple bookmarklet + form and
database feeding into a map. We've built a bunch of stuff around that but
it can be boiled down to that. Note though we don't do automatic detection
of if a paper is open or shut yet.

Thanks,

Joe

Subject: [open-science] ESWC 2014 Call for Papers
Message-ID: <mailman.154.1380822910.3063.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Call for Papers ====
CFP: 11th ESWC Conference  2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org    
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Program Chairs:
- Claudia d'Amato (Dipartimento di Informatica, Universita' degli Studi di Bari, IT)
- Fabien Gandon (Wimmics, Inria, I3S, CNRS, Univ. Nice Sophia Antipolis, FR)

ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and technology innovations related to the Semantic Web. The 11th edition of ESWC will take place from May 25th, 2014 to May 29th, 2014 in Anissaras, Crete, Greece. Besides a main focus on advances in Semantic Web research and technologies, ESWC 2014 is seeking to broaden its attention to span other relevant research areas in which Web semantics plays an important role.

The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a Web of knowledge and services in which the semantics of content is made explicit and content is linked to both other content and services. This arrangement of knowledge-based functionalities is weaving together a large network of human knowledge, and making this knowledge machine-processable to support intelligent behaviour by machines. Additionally, it supports novel applications allowing content from heterogeneous sources to be combined in unforeseen ways and support enhanced matching between users needs, software functionalities and online content.

Creating such an interlinked Web of knowledge which bridges between heterogeneous content and services requires collaboration between several computer science domains. Also, within this hybrid space that the Web has become, where humans and software interact in a complex manner, fundamentally requires an inter-disciplinary approach to find novel solutions to the problems generated.    

ESWC 2014 will feature twelve thematic research tracks (see below) and an in-use and industrial track. Submissions of interdisciplinary research papers, covering more than one thematic track, are also encouraged. In addition, the in-use and industrial track will provide an opportunity for dialogue and discussion on industrial applications, tools, deployment experiences, case studies and usage analysis. 

Submitted papers should describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation. We strongly encourage and appreciate the submission of papers incorporating links to data sets and other material used for evaluation as well as to live demos and software source code.


We therefore encourage submissions addressing several conference research topics. However, each paper should be associated with at least one of the topics of the conference. The main research topics this year are:

Vocabularies, Schemas, Ontologies;
Reasoning;
Linked Open Data;
Social Web;
Web Science;
Data Management, Big data, Scalability;
Natural Language Processing;
Information Retrieval;
Machine Learning;
Mobile Web;
Sensors;
Streams;
Services, processes, and cloud computing. 

Additional special research topics this year are:
Cognition and Semantic Web;
Policies, Rights, Governance;
Semantic multimedia web.


*Important Dates*

Abstract submission        Wednesday 8th January 2014
Full-paper submission    Monday 13th January 2014
Authors' Rebuttals        Wednesday 19th-Friday 21 Feb 2014
Acceptance notifications    Wednesday 26 February 2014
Camera-ready papers     Monday 10th of March 2014


*Submission  Information*

ESWC2014 welcomes the submission of original research and application papers dealing with all aspects of representing and using semantics on the Web. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications papers. The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. 

This year three of the best papers presented at the conference will have the opportunity to submit an extended version to a special issue of the journal "Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability, Applicability" (IOS Press).

Papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be formatted according to the information for LNCS authors. Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format. Papers that exceed 15 pages or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be automatically rejected without a review. Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission - details of this process will be given on the conference Web page at the time of acceptance. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference. More information about the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) are available on the Springer LNCS Web site (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors).

Submissions and reviewing will be supported by the EasyChair system: https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=eswc2014

Subject: [open-science] Fake Cancer study published in 157 Open Access
	Journals
Message-ID: <CAGS_vfrgF_z31Bzoux5-Uv5JLe6TuC9eV_HJ7PYo9GXd1txn+A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

Today I've found this interesting article in National
Geographic<http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131003-bohannon-science-spoof-open-access-peer-review-cancer/>about
a study conducted by Bohannon to test if Open Access peer reviewed
journals actually rejected a spoof study due to several important errors
(copy & paste from the original article):

The spoof study had at least three problems:
>
> **
>
>    -
>
>    The study drug killed cancer cells with increasing doses, even though
>    its data didn't show any such effect.
>    -
>
>    The drug killed cancer cells exposed to medical radiation with
>    increasing effect, even though the study showed the cells weren't exposed
>    to radiation.
>    -
>
>    The study author concluded the paper by promising to start treating
>    people with the drug immediately, without further safety testing.
>
>
Only 106 performed a review, while the others basically accepted the paper
for publication (PLOS One rejected it).

In the article you can feel a subtle "attack" or complain against Open
Access journals. However in the same article they say that they think it
will happen the same in non OA journals; i.e. they mention two cases where
Science, the popular journal, actually accepted two papers that were not
good (one was a faked and the other one refuted).

In summary, I think this type of articles actually reveal a problem
regarding publishing: reviewing articles is really complicated (for any
type of journal), taking into account that as a researcher you don't get
any credit for doing a proper one, and that usually the paper does not
provide all the data, information, etc, etc. to replicate the study.

All the best,

Daniel

It would be great to get something about this up on the open science blog -
explaining what you are looking to do, and what you are looking for. It
would be a good way to reach out to people outside this mailing list...

Hi Daniel

Thanks for sharing! It would have been nice to see a comparison to
acceptance rates by closed access journals, as one commenter further down
the article points out, peer review problems are not OA specific.

The author addresses this in this Retraction Watch Article:
http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/10/03/science-reporter-spoofs-hundreds-of-journals-with-a-fake-paper/

"I did consider it. That was part of my original (very over-ambitious)
plan. But the turnaround time for traditional journals is usually months
and sometimes more than a year. How could I ever pull off a representative
sample? Instead, this just focused on open access journals and makes no
claim about the comparative quality of open access vs. traditional
subscription journals."

This post also explains that 137 of the 157 journals which accepted are
already recognised as predatory (as per Beall's
list<http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/12/06/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers-2013/>
 )

I think National Geographic did start explaining that this is not
specifically an open access issue, but could have flagged up that fake
journals to make money are a by-product of the pay to publish business
model, not the licensing terms under which the papers are are made
available. They also included unhelpful comments like this:

"The public wanted open access to scientific literature, and now they are
getting it," Steneck says. "They now need to get over the idea that they
can get all that information for free without someone doing the real hard
work of reviewing papers."

I don't think anyone has that idea and it maintains the myth that open
access = no peer review rather than shoddy/fake journal = no peer review.

But the abstract singles out OA journals:

"A spoof paper concocted by Science reveals little or no scrutiny at
many open-access journals."

At the very least, this summary is suggestive, and otherwise very
uninformative. This is not scientific reporting, and generally
referred to as FUD. The argumentation is just wrong, and I find it
rather ironic that a journal accepts a paper with clear flaws in the
argumentation that did a sting with a paper with this issue.

Conclusions they could have made: peer review does not work. But that
they do not state.

So, FUD. Let's move on.

Dear all,

I'm working on a similar system - trying to signal which references
cited on Wikipedia are open.
Plans are afoot to start a demo with Wikipedia articles within the
scope of WikiProject Medicine, but we could in principle also do a set
of references first, e.g. the 1k from the IPCC report (if they are
cited on Wikipedia), thus possibly adding another layer to this
nascent collaboration.

The only problem - not a trivial one - is what to count as open, and
how many aspects of this openness should be signaled (cf.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Access/Signalling_OA-ness
).

Hi,

Thanks for sharing the response. It is interesting to read that some of
their members actually gave the green light to publish the paper. They are
investigating it, and I would like to know what happened, just so other
oa-journals improve their review process.

As I said, we can only focus ourselves on the FUD, or think about better
ways to improve peer reviewed papers. To me, the main problem is the peer
reviewed process, independently of the publishing model. IMHO the old model
has more disadvantages than the open one (everything is done under the
curtain) , so let's try to improve it learning from this story.

Cheers,

Daniel

It's presented in Science as a journalistic piece rather than research, the
National Geographic article doesn't make this clear.

Agreed, but this is the FUD that's getting published to a wide readership
and may form the basis of some people's perception of open access so as
Daniel says it's worth being aware of what arguments are being put out
there, as flawed as they may be. I get questions from people about open
access just after stories about it in more general forums and larger media
outlets so it's good to know the details to better explain why they're FUD
(if they are).

I cannot see what is FUD if an article clearly demonstrates serious
problems of gold OA. I am a little more shocked of the reactions of the OA
community which plays down the alarming results than of the article itself.
This is siege mentality and absolutely not helpful.

No, you are wrong there, I'm sorry. The problems are there, but with
peer review, as the title of the article clearly writes. Worse too, is
that some publishers (or better: editorial boards) that do not do
their work.

But the paper *does* *not* show a cause-effect between OA and this
problem. They just did not do the correct experiment for that. A
reviewer should have caught that... but, oh wait, peer review is
broken as the paper found out...

> I am a little more shocked of the reactions of the OA community

They don't. They play down the cause-effect which the paper does not
show, and only suggests. That is called FUD.

Instead, if you read all the online coverage, you will see that the
vocal OA movement has been very active in quality, and ensuring better
quality than the traditional peer-review does.

It disappoints me that people against OA cannot identify the real
underlying factors of quality. Very unscientific, in fact.

YOU are wrong here. If more than half of the tested OA journals accept fake
science then it is playing down to speak of "some" publishers. As I said:
siege mentality which doesn't accept critics.

IMHO, the article didn't demonstrate a serious problem of Open Access 
journals. It probably demonstrated a serious problem with how peer 
review works and just neglected to examine non-OA journals. Ultimately, 
it has supported the hypothesis that *some* journals seem to have 
standards which are more lax than we would like, but it has *certainly* 
collected no data to show that OA journals are better or worse than 
non-OA journals.

For example, if I wanted to do a study to see how good or bad the 
grammar used by people in email is. So we go about collecting large 
archives of email. Because we don't have the time, we go out and collect 
only emails from people named Klaus.

In writing our paper, instead of discussing the error rate in emails in 
general, we decide, "Hey, these emails sent by those names Klaus are 
filled with errors! This is huge news and people should never name their 
kids Klaus unless they want them to have bad email grammar!" Usage of 
the name "Klaus" plummets.

But of course we have no idea if the Klauses of the world actually have 
any worse grammar than the average. We didn't look at the other 99.99%* 
of the world's population. In fact, the Klauses of the world may 
actually have better grammar on average, though our data, without 
supplement, will never be able to tell us.

So are OA journals worse than non-OA journals? I have no idea. Is peer 
review somewhat shoddy? Probably.

well, in addition to Lukes points
we should see how much fake science has been published by traditional
non OA journals in modern history
http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/27383/title/Elsevier-published-6-fake-journals/

One could claim that quite a lot of research before the OA movement started
was fake /biased in more than one way

Many reputable researchers massage their data anyway to make it look more
polished and credible than it is, and a lot of datasets have to be
taken at face value, or can only be scrutinized up to a point

That said,  its a good opportunity for OA to take a good lock at itself and
become
more rigorous and fake proof in the future, that's always worth striving for

In principle I agree, however Klaus points out in quite an interesting
direction. Gold OA (APC version) _enabled_ or _let flourish_ (choose your
version) particular predatory business model. Before introduction of OA and
article processing charges pushing weak paper through the journal willing
to 'cooperate' wasn't that easy, as the transfer of benefits wasn't as
automated as today (it was just harder to _pay_ to get your bogus paper
"published"). Apparently, intrinsic problems of peer review (the same for
OA and non-OA publishing) are much easier to be exploited in Gold OA (APC
version).

For example, if I were predatory publisher I would start to optimize ratio
between image/impact/IF and rejection rate to maximize income (maybe you
could trade a bit of IF but have much smaller rejection rate than PLoS
One?). Such strategy seems to guarantee long-term survival on the market,
as long as APC dominates Gold OA.

Of course, the original piece doesn't reach that far. However, maybe, when
speaking out on the issue, we should mention PeerJ, as an example of OA
journal that removes a direct incentive for the publisher to publish more
at the cost of quality? The fact that PLoS One rejected the bogus paper
does not help much, as the predatory journals and P1 have in principle the
same business models.

Best wishes

Hi everyone,

In terms of metrics, it would be great if journals would publish:

- Impact factor (I do have reservations about using this metric in
isolation)
- Rejection rate.

and if we could develop some kind of

- Journal reputation score (depends on various factors including the
editors and referees' standing - welcome suggestions here).

That ought to separate out many of those predatory publishers bogus
journals who are forever spamming academics.

Samuel
metrics are good ad your suggestions go in the right direction imho

but rejection rates can be artificially  inflated too by having  totally
irrelevant bogus worthless article submitted by friends and family just to
get the rejection figure up.

as scientists know, everything that a can be proven can also be disproven

I think this is where professional associations like OASPA have a critical
role to play. Publishers can only join if they can show that they are
reputable and follow best practice, and this needs to be monitored and
responsive to community feedback. If a publisher is a member, this should
give authors and others confidence in the journal's procedures and metrics.
While some OASPA members were caught out in this 'sting', the organisation
is investigating this and working to see what it can do to ensure good
conduct, all positive steps to ensure higher quality.

It was interesting that despite sending the sting article out to plenty of
newspapers, the author/Science were not willing to share it with OASPA
equally in advance despite repeated requests. To my mind this is a further
indication that the intention was much more to portray OA in a negative
light than to present a balanced analysis, and to put the OA community on
the back foot as much as possible.

Best,
Brian

I tend to think this is merely a matter of self-regulation. Scientific 
publishing has faced dramatic changes during the last few years. Some 
scroungers try to exploit the disorientation of usual practices and the 
delayed adaptation of scientific institutions. This situation will 
probably not last. As OA tends to become the standard of scientific 
publishing, universities are likely to define some selections of 
aknowledged OA publishers, or even create their own OA journals.

Hi List,

I am just curious as to what is the greater potential concern here: that
well-intentioned authors are being deceived, or that demand from dishonest
authors has created a large market for dishonest publishers (possibly in an
attempt to deceive employers who assess their output by volume?)

Last week's Economist
piece<http://www.economist.com/news/china/21586845-flawed-system-judging-research-leading-academic-fraud-looks-good-paper/>seemed
to focus on the latter problem (valuing that industry at $150
million in 2009 and rapidly growing).  The discussion around the Science
piece has been less clear, though it seems to have publishers in the
cross-hairs.

In a different vein, Would a more transparent peer review system, as
practised by both some APC-based OA and some subscription journals, have
addressed concerns this piece raises?

Hi Jenny, All,

I see the Economist has picked up on this story, too. Unfortunately, their version<http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21587197-it-seems-dangerously-easy-get-scientific-nonsense-published-sciences-sokal> links open access to poor quality control. A shame, as The Economist has previously covered OA in a quite positive light.

The article does not mention the lack of comparison with closed access publications, nor indicate that many of the journals were already known to be predatory. There is some useful criticism in the Reader's comments, but none as succinct as yours, Jenny.

Those of us old enough to remember the Sokal hoax will be bracing ourselves now for the tsunami of controversy that the "Bohannon hoax" will generate. What seems clear is that, for those opposed to open access, this is a godsend. Because busy managers who make decisions about science funding are probably going to take their cue from The Economist and other mainstream media, not from discussions on blogs and list-serves of the OA community.

What can be done? Consider first The Economist article. I would encourage  you to consider writing a letter to the editor, on behalf of OKF. This is likely to have much more impact than yet another comment on the web page of the article. Would be good for OKF visibility, too. Concise and witty is what the editor is looking for.

What else can be done? Despite its flaws, the Bohannon hoax shines light on a serious problem, namely the way OA is being co-opted on a grand scale by corrupt publishers. Much like Bitcoin being co-opted by Silk Road, this can seriously damage OA and the whole open science movement by association. It suggests that some form of independent vetting of scientific journals is necessary.

Beall's list is a great starting point. It needs to be extended beyond OA. And it should be made more widely known (I had not come across it before) and put on a more solid footing than just a personal blogpost. Could that be a job for OKF?

What about the wider implications of the Bohannon hoax for scientific publishing, OA or not? It seems to me that, rather than engaging in endless arguments about the limitations of Bohannon's analysis, the best thing would be to commission a further study, that did a controlled comparison of open vs. closed journals, as well as predatory vs. non-predatory and peer-reviewed vs. non-peer-reviewed, to measure their relative susceptibility to fraud. Another variable to test is the scale of the fraud itself, from flagrant to subtle.

That's a lot of work. Perhaps a job for a Panton Fellow?

Francois

Hi Daniel

Thanks for sharing! It would have been nice to see a comparison to acceptance rates by closed access journals, as one commenter further down the article points out, peer review problems are not OA specific.

The author addresses this in this Retraction Watch Article:
http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2013/10/03/science-reporter-spoofs-hundreds-of-journals-with-a-fake-paper/

"I did consider it. That was part of my original (very over-ambitious) plan. But the turnaround time for traditional journals is usually months and sometimes more than a year. How could I ever pull off a representative sample? Instead, this just focused on open access journals and makes no claim about the comparative quality of open access vs. traditional subscription journals."

This post also explains that 137 of the 157 journals which accepted are already recognised as predatory (as per Beall's list<http://scholarlyoa.com/2012/12/06/bealls-list-of-predatory-publishers-2013/> )

I think National Geographic did start explaining that this is not specifically an open access issue, but could have flagged up that fake journals to make money are a by-product of the pay to publish business model, not the licensing terms under which the papers are are made available. They also included unhelpful comments like this:

"The public wanted open access to scientific literature, and now they are getting it," Steneck says. "They now need to get over the idea that they can get all that information for free without someone doing the real hard work of reviewing papers."

I don't think anyone has that idea and it maintains the myth that open access = no peer review rather than shoddy/fake journal = no peer review.

Hi there,

Today I've found this interesting article in National Geographic<http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131003-bohannon-science-spoof-open-access-peer-review-cancer/> about a study conducted by Bohannon to test if Open Access peer reviewed journals actually rejected a spoof study due to several important errors (copy & paste from the original article):


The spoof study had at least three problems:

  *   The study drug killed cancer cells with increasing doses, even though its data didn't show any such effect.

  *   The drug killed cancer cells exposed to medical radiation with increasing effect, even though the study showed the cells weren't exposed to radiation.

  *   The study author concluded the paper by promising to start treating people with the drug immediately, without further safety testing.

Only 106 performed a review, while the others basically accepted the paper for publication (PLOS One rejected it).

In the article you can feel a subtle "attack" or complain against Open Access journals. However in the same article they say that they think it will happen the same in non OA journals; i.e. they mention two cases where Science, the popular journal, actually accepted two papers that were not good (one was a faked and the other one refuted).

In summary, I think this type of articles actually reveal a problem regarding publishing: reviewing articles is really complicated (for any type of journal), taking into account that as a researcher you don't get any credit for doing a proper one, and that usually the paper does not provide all the data, information, etc, etc. to replicate the study.

All the best,

Daniel

There is a more-or-less definitive rejection at
http://gunther-eysenbach.blogspot.ca/ . Eysenbach received submissions of
the hoax and rejected them for his high-quality OA journal.

We've been through this before with PRISM (not the current one) but one
commisioned by legacy publishers to discredit OA. See
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/10/02/why-open-access-really-matters/(my
comments on Peter Suber's critique).PRISM had a strap line "OA is junk
science". This is the ghost of PRISM rising Zombie like.

It has to be defended, but my guess is that there's enough fury in the
blogosphere that a considered response will arise. I'd look to OASPA as
focus.  I'd take Eysenbach as starting point. I wouldn't write volumes. The
affair  lowers Sciencemag to the levels of the Daily Mail. It's a sad fact
that we are fighting billions of dollars with volunteer labour. The
important think is that we are united.

This is a political activity. Personally I am concentrating on fighting for
the right to mine content - I think our very thinly spread energies have to
be used judiciously. We have right on our side but there is a very tough
battle.

I am still disappointed of the quite unfair handling of the Bohannon scoop
by OA advocates I admire(d) like Suber or now Murray Rust. I never thought
I would be on the side of Scholarly Kitchen

I still cannot see serious flaws and would like to be spared by offlist
comments suggesting I should read the critics of Suber (quite unfair),
Eisen (unfair) and Taylor (ridicolous). I will delete such spam immediately.

The "definitive rejection" by Eysenbach is in my opinion absolutely
worthless. The study isn't "blatantly unethical" as Eysenbach writes
because only an undercover operation could demonstrate the extension of the
OA sump. There is an shocking alliance of scam publishers and editors
calling Bohannon a "criminal" and pseudo-serious critiics like Eysenbach.

Hi Peter, Klaus,

Let's keep our eyes on the ball here. We can agree to respectfully disagree about some of the specifics of the study, but when it comes to influence, and article in The Economist (millions of readers, many of whom are highly influential yet not well-versed in science publishing issues) totally dwarfs the impact of a personal opinion in "Gunther Eysenbach's Random Research Rants".

This one isn't going to go away just because parts of the blogosphere wish it would. Science is the highest ranking journal in the US. Bohannon is an experienced and respected science journalist. IMHO, what he did is a decent piece of investigative science journalism. Holding it up to the ethical standards of scientific publications misses the point. Beall, himself, has praised Bohannon's study<http://scholarlyoa.com/2013/10/03/science/#more-2386>.

I agree with Peter that OKF should stay focussed on its core competence in this area, opening up scientific data. But it would be wonderful to see an alliance of reputable institutions like OKF putting together a concise, well-formulated rebuttal, and broadcasting it well beyond the confines of the OA community. Starting with the Letters column of The Economist.

The issue here is not the study itself, but the distortions that mainstream media is introducing in transmitting its main message. I agree with Klaus: let's focus on the message, not the messenger.

Francois

I apologize for having send my  message meant for the list  to Klaus only
and not to the list,
Still I think that this discussion has become nasty by calling me a liar.I
do not accept this kind treatment.
The science of the Hoax sucks, and if you do not agree, come with
scientific arguments
But you do not accept criticism apparently by writing:  stop lying, End Of
Discussion

Dear Klaus,

Please read the reactions by Peter Suber, Michael Eisen and Mike Taylor.
It is not a question of not accepting critics, it is a question of not
accepting bad science, wrong conclusions and generalisations
The studied group of journals was a non-randomly selected group of OA
journals where 30 % was based in India and 121 / 304 were known predatory
journals. It was not at all representative of the group of 10,000+  open
access journals that exist.Small wonder that  in  the  result many of those
journals turned out to be bogus....
Apart from that in the selected group the journals that published the
largest nr of articles did very well

Hi,

I like the idea proposed from Francois. A joint message from OKF science
group, Mozilla Science Lab <https://wiki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab>and Creative
Commons Science <http://creativecommons.org/science> about this topic
regarding the Economist article would be very valuable in my opinion.

I've tried to take a clear-headed look at some of the numbers behind the Science article in comments here:

http://scienceblogs.com/stoat/2013/10/04/oh-the-fun-you-can-have/#comment-34155

If anyone needs to pick over the entrails in preparing a response, that might be useful.  My main conclusion is that Beall's list is a strong indicator of bogosity: DOAJ journals do much better (although still not as well as we would like).

I'm not going to claim serious flaws in the methodology, or even in what
the article itself states. However, to accept it as an expose of OA alone
is a serious flaw.

a) There is no comparative data for submissions to closed access journals
b) No attempt was made (or at least documented to have been made) to obtain
waivers for the APCs

On that second point, the article was submitted with African affiliations,
which would have been cause to grant a waiver for any of the OA publishers
that operate such policies for lower income countries.

Either, and preferably both, of these would have given indication as to
whether the acceptances were driven by predatory desires to reap the APCs.
As it is, the Bohannon article is missing (at least) two critical pieces of
evidence, which means it is only telling half a story, at best.

Besides, this is ultimately a largely self-correcting problem. Open science
can be discredited, journals will get reputations for being routinely
discredited (Negative Impact Factors, if you will) and no serious author
with real results is going to want to publish in journals with a bad
reputation. (And for any new authors that are not so well informed, there
should be appropriate support structures from their funders, colleagues and
institutions to avoid the problems).

If predatory publishers remain, and a small number of authors can afford to
pay them to publish what they know to be crap, so be it. The only danger of
that is bogus studies being published in order to sell useless products as
being scientifically proven - but that's a consumer issue, not a
research/science one.

This would be a much more serious issue if credible journals that command a
good reputation were accepting nonsense to harvest APCs. But this study
actually showed that they did not. And whilst anyone could make a mistake,
the respected journals aren't going to wave through poor articles - because
they would very quickly lose their reputation (and hence value, and
revenue).

The same nonsense you have written before.

If I write an article on Tibet I do not have the duty to take the rest of
the world as control group. "Really bad" is only what OA advocates do when
ignoring uncomfortable truths.

Klaus. I now believe you are just trolling. Thanks for reminding me that 
the best way to deal with internet trolls is to not engage them.

I completely agree. The Economist is widely read. But more importantly, 
the letter section is widely read and respected as well (MHO). A letter 
there from people with a bigger reputation than me would be the first 
step. Or perhaps a letter signed by the open knowledge foundation 
itself? (I have the feeling they would not accept a letter not signed by 
an individual).

Quick survey says letters are ~300 words or less. Not sure what their 
criteria is, but 300 seems to be about the longest letter (maybe 350) 
based on a brief (non-scientific!) survey of a 
<http://www.economist.com/news/letters/21586511-our-capital-freeze-index-utah-chinese-banks-montessori-schools-biofuels-brazilian-foreign> 
few 
<http://www.economist.com/news/letters/21587182-biodiversity-software-jobs-unemployment> 
issues 
<http://www.economist.com/news/letters/21586273-syria-chemical-weapons-high-speed-rail-azerbaijan-italy-burials>.

I think it would be important to get it in by yesterday. The economist 
is weekly and they often run criticisms of the past issue in the very 
next issue. Best to get it in while it is fresh on people's minds.

What's next? Think Science would accept some sort of follow-up? Any 
other journals or major outlets?

Can I suggest we try to avoid personal issues and rather see what we can
collaborate on?  If we don't agree , then it's difficult to take communal
action.  Collaborative actions - documents, software, protocols, data,
meetings, fact-finding , etc. are one of the very strong points of OKF.

We're not strong in Open Access (despite the hard work TomO put in, for
which thanks) and that's why I think we have to prioritize our actions. And
particularly tackle the issues that others don't.

If anyone wants to bring together a group to write on this issue, make
suggestions now. There's no prior "membership requirement" :-)

To:






Dear Friends,


We would like to invite you to the conference ?Open Science Works!? in the
European Parliament on October 15th from 9:00 to 11:00 (room PHS 5B001)
under the auspices of MEP Marietje Schaake with the support of the
TransAtlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD).


?Open?, ?access? and ?new innovation models? are becoming new buzz words in
many quarters of academia, business and civil society. Nowhere is this
discussion as vigorous as in the field of scientific and academic research.
Intense debate and new proposals of legislation are increasingly present on
these subjects in EU Institutions.


We shall consider ?open access scientific publishing?, "text and data
mining?, ?open science? and ?open education?. These all pose difficult
questions concerning the protection of the public good, scientific
responsibility and the adaptation of science to the digital age. Also at
stake are promoting new business models, saving public money and, even,
saving lives.


Programme


Introductory remarks by MEP Marietje Schaake


Christoph Bruch, Helmholz Stiftung, Berlin:  "Text and Data Mining: the way
forward in the EU."


Alma Swan, SPARC, "The EU?s new Open Access Policy: making it happen."


Dr. Tim Hubbard, Human Genome researcher, "The importance and potential of
Open Science".



The European Commission will be represented by DG Connect.


The discussion will be moderated by Mr. David Hammerstein, Senior advocate,
TransAtlantic Consumer Dialogue, Brussels.




We would kindly ask you to confirm your attendance to
openscience.works at gmail.com by 11 October 2013.
Should you require a badge to access the European Parliament, please do not
forget to provide us with your full name, nationality, passport/ID number
and date of birth.

Subject: [open-science] Open research Cambridge local group
Message-ID: <CAOZPT-wLzeMjU81bNMy7qc0q8LfET+CGPdXU502jK97K9aeL5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have a recently created and published a page in the OKFN site for our new
group in Cambridge, UK -
(Open research Cambridge - http://science.okfn.org/community/local-groups/
cambridge-open-research/) and I would like to know how to add us on the
local group scroll
(http://science.okfn.org/community/local-groups/) - How should I proceed?
As we are inviting new people to the community it is important to be easily
found in the site.... right now one can find us only if he/she types "open
research Cambridge"...

I would also like to add the open science logo to our
posts/facebbok/twitter and could only save a small and low resolution fig -
where can I find/who should I contact for a bigger and higher resolution
fig?

Thanks a lot in advance
Keren Limor-Waisberg

Hi All

I agree time is of the essence and have set up a googledoc, however I have
a morning in a molecular lab to look forward to and won't be able to
populate it until lunchtime - please feel free to plough ahead with
suggesting 300 words!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kgFHnG-HhstNbDE2AOX5LXNkqSOTyefy1LRpB2Rc328/edit#

No matter what we think of this journalistic piece (as Francois points out,
it was never intended as a scientific study and appears in the News section
of Science) the message is reaching lots of people from high profile media
outlets that open access means poor quality research rather than that some
journals do poor peer review and APC business models are a gift to
fraudulent publishers, so I think we should make some sort of statement
with other organisations who are interested.

I think the latter point raises some really interesting questions for a
social scientist to tackle with a well designed study, as Carl points out
in his earlier email:
"What is the greater potential concern here: that well-intentioned authors
are being deceived, or that demand from dishonest authors has created a
large market for dishonest publishers (possibly in an attempt to deceive
employers who assess their output by volume?)"

Please pass this email onto other people who may be interested/tweet the
link to the document. Even better get them to sign up to the mailing list -
now accessible from the front page of the website for those who find
mailman pages a bit old school:
http://science.okfn.org/.

Hey all,

Just to say that I've started to draft a document from OKF. I'll share this
later today as I'm just nipping out for a meeting.

Best,
Michelle

Hey all,

Thank you ever so much for this thread and the suggestion of writing a
letter in to the Economist.

Taking this idea on board, and some of the comments in this thread, I've
quickly drafted a letter which can be found here:
https://docs.google.com/a/okfn.org/document/d/17cj70QbpdHUVHzG5HpN5GC49Um29SPeVMimTExidRYQ/edit

It would be great to get the thoughts from members of the community on this
draft.

We will submit the letter to the Economist, and sign it either from Rufus
Pollock or Jonathan
Gray (although possibly 'with support from the open science working group')
as we need a CEO/Directors name on it.

Best,
Michelle

Hi Keren (and all prospective local group organisers!)

Changes to the OKF website can come through an administrator (usually me)
However, the local group scroll is fed from a spreadsheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtV3tIqIu0UZdHpUVnhDbk96dDUwSFFxMzJkZWpOTlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0
I will link a form from the website to make it easier for people to add
their own groups, we were playing with some different systems for doing
this but this appears to the the simplest for now.

In terms of the open science logo, there is a better one here
http://assets.okfn.org/p/science/img/icon-512.png

Hope that helps! For other working group based enquiries you can reach the
relevant coordinators on science at okfn.org and we should be able to help you
out!

Jenny

Dear all,

I am not sure if the following link has been posted on this list, but 
perhaps some of you maybe interested in partipating in Science's live 
chat for this topic (already started):

3p.m EDT, which should be 20.00 GMT.
So, you can check back in a couple of hours.

...

debate---University of Pennsylvania biologist David Roos and University 
of California, Berkeley, biologist and Public Library of Science founder 
Michael Eisen---on *Thursday, 10 October, at 3 p.m. EDT on this page* to 
chat about the dark side of open access and the future of academic 
publishing with /Science/ contributing correspondent Jon Cohen. Be sure

My deep concern about the Bohannon sting is not the methodology but the
motivation. This reads exactly like the "dirty tricks" of PRISM/AAP and
Dezenhall in 2007 where the AAP (to which AAAS belongs) paid a consultant
to discredit OA. "Open Access is junk science".

I have blogged my concerns and some links at* *

I shall try to ask this to the Science journalists later today in the video
conference.

Everyone,

Jarkko in Finland is involved in this and looking for others who might be
interested - open data, open source and open hardware!

Details below.

Hi Laura,

My name is Jarkko Moilanen and one of the Open Knowledge Foundation
Finland "activists". Currently I manage open data activities and
community development in Pirkanmaa region (paid post by Hermia Ltd).

I'm also organizing national level event called Spaceship 2014. Our
event is part of annual NASA driven Space Apps Challenge event.
http://spaceappschallenge.org/

I was co-organizer in the 2013 Spaceship event in Tampere, which
gathered around 250 entrepreneurs, space specialists from national
organizations and community developers. This year our event will be
national in co-operation with Helsinki and Turku. This year we will have
more partners and sponsors such as LinkedIn and Google to mention a few.
Event in Finland will be taken to Baltic Sea cruise ship :)

I was wondering if OKF would like to be part of this kind open data (and
open source/hardware) driven activities since NASA is pushing their data
to open data as well. OKF could use the network around the globe to
participate at local level.

Yours,

/Jarkko

Hey everyone,

Thanks for forwarding this, Laura. I led the Citizen Science team at the
2013 edition of the event in Paris (
http://fr.okfn.org/2013/04/18/partons-pour-mars/, French). OKF France was
partnering at that time with the local organizers.

I'm not sure yet how the 2014 edition will go. I'll let you know anyway :)
And it'll be great to see how it goes elsewhere.

Rayna

Subject: [open-science] when does literature go out of copyright?
Message-ID: <CAMPqvY8m1-ULQHdawNgy-wKkVAoK58eOZKnkqKaDjdekOFMo8Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm currently reading literature from 1937... seriously. To have
access to rather basic (pun intended) data on the pKa's of organic
compounds.

Fortunately, I could get access to the paper I was interested in
without much effort, but it made me wonder on copyright law for
material under copyright with a publisher. You always here, so many
years after the author is dead. How does that work after copyright
reassignment? When does this 1937 paper go out of copyright?

(Of course, the cost of redistribution, editing, peer review, etc,
etc, of a research paper is mostly covered in a few years for non-OA
papers, I think that publishers would be brave to just make literature
older than, say, 25 years, gold OA by default. Or are there other
reasons not to do so, other than capatalizing on the knowledge
captured in it?)

Egon

I'm confining myself to the scientific literature.

This is a serious problem.

Firstly it's very difficult to know who the copyright holder is, and what
jurisidiction the work comes under (different countries have different
periods). Then there is the actual work - if a publisher scans a 100 year
old article (which might be out of copyright) then they may/will claim
copyright from the day of scanning.

And then there is the actual practice - librarians will always tell you
that when there is uncertainty then they have to operate on the safe side.
With the result that when Henry Rzepa wanted a paper from the 19th century
it was only available as a DRM'ed copy. See
http://bethaninfoprof.wordpress.com/2010/05/11/why-cant-we-teach-peter-murray-rust-about-drm/

So the simple answer is:
The non-open access scientific literature will NEVER be out of copyright.
