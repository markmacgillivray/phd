Open scientists!

We want your help to liven up the Open Science Working Group blog
http://science.okfn.org/blog/. Got a project you want to tell us and the
OKFN network about? Been to an interesting talk you'd like to report to the
world?

Any and all submissions welcomed, we'd be delighted to receive short blogs
on talks, articles or media stories about open science.

Remember that the Open Science Federation @openscience do an excellent job
of keeping us all up to date on the latest news, views and events in open
science via Google+ (https://plus.google.com/117417705451874519785) and
Twitter so we will be aiming to provide "value-added" content rather than
replicate their efforts :)

In addition I'd really like to get some profiles of different members of
the group up to demonstrate the scope of interests we have. Here are three
questions to answer - be as brief or verbose as you like and send them back
to me with a photo:

1) What's your background?
2) What got you interested in open science?
3) In your opinion, what is the most exciting thing that open science makes
possible?

 Note on Membership:
By our definition, you're a member if you're on the mailing list and you
can request to be added to the list on the website
http://science.okfn.org/community/members/ by emailing me. We currently
have 369 subscribers to the mailing list and only 56 names on the
membership list so don't be shy.

It would also be great to have some people willing to help manage the extra
content and edit the blog, which would only be a small time commitment.

So please reply if you:
- Have an idea for a blog post
- Would be willing to answer the three questions and send me a photo for
the site
- Would be willing to help edit/curate the blog

Looking forward to hearing from you!

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] github/R stack for the nomadic researcher
Message-ID: <87limfumhj.fsf@pobox.com>


[apologies for length of post, but it's a big topic]

summary: soliciting comment (and answers to questions at bottom) on
use of a stack based on github and R for recording, presenting, and
publishing of research, esp for those loosely bound to institutions.

details:

I'm a very-early-career researcher (contracting on a project which
hopefully will also "become" my master's thesis) wanting to do 
open science. As seems usual, I've been taught a lot about my domain of
inquiry (earth systems) and work (atmospheric modeling), but not so much
about the mechanics of recording and sharing data, on the continuum of
increasing formality from enabling public sharing to peer-reviewed
publication. (It seems one normally absorbs this from one's adviser or
supervisor, but in my case that's broken, and suspect it's often
suboptimal for those attempting to open their science.) So, as
previously noted

http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2012-March/001427.html

I'm attempting to discover tools and workflows for research management
and sharing as fast as I can, in the time I can take away from research
(and life-support :-) I've been reading a fair amount, esp about tools
from/using github and R (and particularly about rOpenSci, though that's
beyond my current requirements). I'm thinking I could manage my workflow
using (in increasing level of importance to me, but decreasing level of
familiarity to me):

1 Various data/results repositories as needed/suitable (to, e.g.,
  overcome space limitations, access specialized functionality),
  whether institutional (i.e., my employer or school) or more public
  (e.g., arXiv, bitbucket, figshare, flickr, github, googledocs,
  PANGAEA). (Thanks to Daniel Mietchen for pointer to PANGAEA.)

<aside> Why not just use institutional, esp given that my employer and
school are both public? That gets to the nomadic (or "precarious")
requirement. My employer is under severe financial constraint, and I
am merely a contractor, so I could be out at fairly short notice.
(Since they pay my tuition, not to mention my food and rent, if I lose
the contract I probably leave my current school, too, and become
#scholarlypoor--thanks to Peter Murray-Rust for pointer to that.) My
work workgroup's workspace is mostly inside a firewall whose admins
block all but the group with which I'm contracting, and getting
"outsiders" inside seems to require the proverbial act of Congress, so
public repos are needed for outside collaboration anyway. However the
admins @ work are fairly responsive; by contrast, the systems at my
(school's) department are run as a cost center (e.g., one is expected
to pay for more than a fairly small amount of space), so the admins
tend to be as responsive as one pays them to be (which in my case is,
not at all). Finally, if I hafta leave and find new {work, school,
degree program}, I'll need means by which to "show my portfolio"
anyway. </aside>

2 A top-level public github wiki, where I would

* list my research plan
* document results
* "tie together" repositories for data and results (more below)

  and from which I would hopefully 

* generate "reports" or "formal content," e.g., slides, presentations,
  articles

  I'm already using pages on a mediawiki @ work for this purpose,
  which works well for me and my group, but is inside the savage
  firewall. I could presumably forklift my pages from the firewalled
  wiki into github (using markup=mediawiki for now, for convenience
  and ease of backout), and switch to a more publishing-capable format
  (more below) later.

3 Means to generate formal content from the wiki content, or easily
  transfer content to/from the TLW (top-level wiki) to documents. This
  is where I'm definitely weakest, but it seems (IIUC) one could do
  this with, e.g., knitr and markdown. The advantage for me is, I'm
  already using R for pretty much everything that's not

- actually part of the model on which I work (which is all-fortran)

- easier to do in bash or python (i.e., more OS-level coding)

<aside> Why R and not python for data analysis and assimilation? 
For quality of community, and particularly emphasis on openness, they
seem pretty equivalent. I've just been using R because

* base R has included most of the functionality I need, but to get
  that with python requires the Enthought tools, which may be why ...

* the clusters on which I work (but lack sudo) have R, but not EPD
  (even the free numpy/scipy currently available)

* I work with more R users than python users
</aside>

The final item is fortunately not so important to me now, because I'm
almost entirely ignorant about it now:

4 More advanced curatorial functions, e.g.

* backup: having stuff so spread-out seems scary, but the individual
  providers seem trustworthy (famous last words :-) I know how to
  backup my linux boxes, and do, but have only vague notions regarding
  the backup of a widely-distributed dataset.

* generating persistent identifiers, e.g., DOIs. URIs will do for now.

Does the above seem feasible using the github/R stack? or are there
superior alternatives for this usecase? I'm particularly seeking
answers/doc to the following questions regarding item 3:

1 What are best practices for most easily/capably generating "content"
  (e.g., slides, presentations, papers) from the code/data store(s)
  (i.e. the TLW and repositories to which it points)? E.g.

1.1 Presuming one's analytic code is mostly R, should one be using
    knitr, or sweave, or (given that I'm not especially TeX-strong
    anyway) Something Completely Different?

1.2 What markup should one use in the TLW? Can one use .tex/.rnw
    directly? If not, how much does that reduce the utility of the
    wiki? Alternatively, are there markups which generate .tex/.rnw
    more or less easily/capably?

1.3 What are best tools for implementing this process? Emacs, Eclipse,
    RStudio? Or one of the "lab notebooks" (for a non-wiki
    implementation)?

2 How to pull in citations/references from external stores (e.g.,
  mendeley, zotero)? Those are probably the main research inputs which
  I suspect I either could not, or would not want to, store in the TLW
  (but ICBW, and if so am open to correction).

Feel free to break out separate threads for specific topics/questions,
move to more-relevant lists/forums, etc.

TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

Hi Tom,

Your proposal of github + knitr + markdown sounds good to me.  Here are
some thoughts based largely from my own experience.

Given you're already thinking R code, I'd recommend structuring your
project's repository as an R package.  (definitely see the manual for
details <http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html>)

Several reasons:
1. Easily handles integration and compiling of Fortran code which can be
called from R (for visualization, etc).
2. Provides a natural way to handle dependencies (package dependencies,
config files, etc)
3. Provides a nice standard way to organize the data files, documentation
files, and metadata (license, citation, news, etc).
4. Provides utilities to automate creating documentation, running the unit
tests / error checks, etc.
5. Provides a portable object to share your project with other R users.

When writing your code, I wouldn't write everything in Sweave.  I'd
abstract the main functions and stick them in the R/ directory, with
literate-programming (i.e. roxygen) documentation.  This way they are most
functional and portable.  Some of these functions may just be calling your
fortran code, which can sit in a src directory.

I'd then write knitr markdown files that call these functions with
particular choices of parameters, visualization commands, etc as my
day-to-day code-running exploration.  (A natural place for these in an R
package is /inst/examples, or on the github wiki page of the project if
you'd rather separate them, and use the wiki).

Of course the whole project is a git repository, so each file has full
version history.  Large data files probably need to live elsewhere, as well
as images created when the code runs (knitr can upload automatically for
these, as you probably know).

That's what I try to do anyway -- here's an example of such a
project<https://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control/> structure,
in all it's imperfection.

Publishing to wiki / notebook / journals
Here I describe how this fits into my daily
notebook<http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/4325>.
 Using markdown as your base, instead of Sweave's .Rnw as you mentioned,
gives you more flexibility with your notes.  They can be displayed nicely,
figures embedded, mathjax and all, on github, posted to a jekyll blog or
other platform, or converted to epub/latex/pdf/doc etc (usually with
pandoc).  Check out the knitr-book  <https://github.com/yihui/knitr-book>for
a great example of this.

On Backup
I think this markdown / portable way will allow you to move and display the
code/writing/figures to the top-level wiki most fluidly.  Use the github
repository to manage backups as well as versions -- you can just keep
copies sync'd across multiple machines, backup drives, servers, using git,
which gives you a nice redundant and distributed backup.

On tools
You asked about choice of IDE, language, etc, and seemed to answer all your
own questions.  Use what you know best and what your colleagues know best.
 When in doubt, go for the most flexible, eh?

On citations
Not sure what's best here, have just been exploring the options myself.  Of
course .Rnw + mendeley-generated bibtex works nicely.  For a markdown based
system, you can add pandoc-flavored markdown for citations (which pandoc
can then format for you in the markdown format), or just use latex-style
citations which will just sit there until you use something like pandoc to
turn markdown to latex/pdf.

I've experimented a bit with dynamic citations (i.e. look up by doi),
making this part of knitr. (some notes
here<http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/4352>
)


I'd be curious how your experience goes, what you feel works / doesn't
work, and certainly many others on the list have further insights.

-Carl

Tom,
This is a really valuable post. I feel your concerns directly. I have
copied in our new Panton fellows (though I am sure they read this list
anyway!)

No apologies needed!

I am giving an important presentation to  Europe "Open Infrastructures for
Open Science" and Neelie Kroes and others will be there. I am getting my
thoughts together as I have to give the plenary that informs the rest of
the workshop. Currently my thoughts are:


   - Europe (and the world) is losing 10 billion + in unused and restricted
   data. (I said this to Hargreaves)
   - We MUST have easily accessible research repositories, probably on a
   domain basis (Dryad, Pangaea, TARDIS, etc.)
   - Institutional Repos do not work for STM and never will
   - Mandates are a blunt weapon and so far have little effectiveness
   - Non-Commercial destroys knowledge

We must give the researchers something they want. Sourceforge does this for
code. I use Sourceforge (actually now Bitbucket and Github) several times a
day. All my code is backed up, shareable, reusable, validated etc.

   - There must be a "Data forge" for Europe. Figshare was built by one
   graduate student in one year. I would give 3rd year graduate students
   funding to do this - it's a hundred times more cost effective than
   repositories.

I'd like to collect ideas on this llist and present them next week (11th).
An OKF data manifesto for Open Science (in Europe) Who knows what might
come?

Hi Peter,

What is your context for this bit?

There is evidence of effectiveness of the latter (data into Genbank, PDB,
GEO, etc).

OK - I will rephrase that.
 [data] Mandates are a blunt weapon and so far have partial effectiveness

Compliance with (say) Wellcome mandates for Open Access full text is
probably about 60%. (The figure is not known). MRC is probably less in my
small experience. There are few University mandates that seem to be
enforced - I'd be surprised if 10% of UK universities had effective OA
mandates for fulltext.

PDB and Genbank have worked because the community require it, not the
funders. I wouldn't call that a mandate in the current political sense.

But I've put these ideas out for community revision - they are starting
points

The lens I put on this marvelous thread is a bifocal one: knowledge
federation [1] and knowledge gardening, about which I have a few
slides [2] with more coming. If any aspect of either of those raises
questions, I'd be happy to contribute to this conversation.

The Times Higher has some figures for mandate compliance for the Wellcome
Trust this week:
http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=419475

This says only 55% compliance overall to date, and only 85% from the Sanger
Institute itself.

[whoops, to the list this time]

Peter, thanks for this discussion.

I'd say it is important to keep the following three distinctions really
clear when talking about open data mandates and their effectiveness:

*what is mandated*:  OA to literature and open data are very different,
with different motivations and hurdles for the researcher.  Making
parallels to mandates for OA literature risks confusing people on data, and
should perhaps be done only when making these differences very clear.

*who does the mandating*:  journals or funders.  There is evidence that *
journal* mandates are quite effective, and evidence they are one of the
most effective tools for encouraging public data archiving.  I'm not
familiar with any evidence on *funder* mandates.  There may be some, say
with GWAS data funded by the NIH?

*how mandates are monitored*:  Clearly mandates to "share on request" are
likely much less effective than mandates to "provide an accession
url/number before we'll consider your contract complete."

Heather

i agree on the dataforge front...  git doesn't handle large files well, and
figshare, buzzdata etc. seem to be mostly for visual or tabular data sets.
out of curiosity, as i'm starting to learn about thedatahub.com, it seems
rather perfect for data set management, and even has a change lists for
data sets, groups, user pages, etc. (especially if there were some command
line tools so i could "commit" changes to my data set periodically and
upload them :)).

is there a reason people find ckan/thedatahub insufficient for data
management needs? is it related to technical/features, or to peoples'
familiarity and confidence around the longevity of the site?

I assume people on this list are more clued up than the average. My
argument - which was sketchy - was that funder mandates for OA papers are
only 55% successful by Wellcome. That mandates for data (which requires a
lot more work) is likely to be much worse. A PDF is relatively easy to
deposit, a dataset is 10 times harder at least

Yes - and they come about by editors or societes insisting on good science.

It's probably early days. But broad policy can only come from funders, not
from journals.

Was talking to a senior scientist today - s/he said "the dept will do as
little as possible to comply with the res council - just to get them off
our backs". So data mandates will not de facto deliver.

It's history, I think. We should now be making the case for such a
repository and I don't think Figshare is it. I have rather negelected
datahub because the original CKAN was metadata-oriented.

I'll be making the case in Europe next week that we badly need informal
repositories and maybe this is the time to push the datahub?

You're presupposing folks even know about these tools. (Never overlook
ignorance as a cause of behavior :-) Before your post I hadn't seen
either. I'm still generally ignorant regarding the OKF--being US-based
probably doesn't help, but mostly I'm head-down in my work, coming up
occasionally to "scratch itches," like, why am I cut'n' pasting so
@#$%^&! much? (A: because I can't send OP links to content on my
current wiki, because its firewall's admins are such a PITA.) What I
know, and hence seems useful to me in this domain, are sites/tools
like github, google, sourceforge (etc) which I've used.

Regarding CKAN, it's probably

http://ckan.org/solutions/pricing/
>> FREE[:] Deploy your own community instance hosted on your servers.

If I had my own servers, my life would be rather different. I might be
more productive, but I don't have time to be an admin (famous last
words). I would also hafta eat pet food to afford

>> CKAN Catalogue[:] from $400 / ?300 a month

(which might also degrade my productivity, though maybe not :-)

I'm unclear on the relationship between thedatahub.org and CKAN:
instance to framework? If so, what is thedatahub.org's data store, and
how is that priced?

I suspect these tools would be quite attractive to folks with my needs
but more $. Unfortunately, being presently near bottom of both the
academic foodchain and the income distribution drives many decisions.

FWIW, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

Fantastic!

Thanks Jessy, some excellent suggestions and glad to see that someone had
beaten me to it and added them to the etherpad already :)

I've noticed a couple of others adding to the etherpad as well - absolutely
great, keep the ideas coming! Be as creative as you like, we can deal with
the details later ;) Etherpad here: http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

This is looking really good, thank you everyone for your contributions and
enthusiasm!

Cheers,
Laura

Dear All

You may have seen this filling the #openscience stream on Twitter, but for
those of you who haven't the  Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet
and Society will be offering doctoral stipends to people for projects in
the field of:


   - ?Regulation and order from a social scientific perspective,
   particularly within the fields of copyright and big data?
   - ?Open science ? science in transformation?

(and also, but not as related to our interests)

   - ?New concepts of data protection in the light of European proposals?
   - ?The current structural change of the public sphere and its legal
   consequences?

http://hiig.de/en/2012/03/01/pre-announcement-doctoral-stipends-%E2%80%9Einternet-and-society%E2%80%9C-by-the-alexander-von-humboldt-institute-for-internet-and-society-hiig-2012/

Check out the announcement and do pass the news to anyone you think might
be interested in applying. It is excellent to see research into open
science being funded in this way and we hope to see more opportunities such
as this and the Panton Fellowships coming along in the near future.

Jenny

Excellent.

This is sufficiently close to Panton that I wonder whether we should make
contact.

carl, thanks and i agree that the science markup would fit as a component
of that session (i've moved it to reflect as much in the etherpad). it
would be cool to develop the structure of that session a bit more together,
if it goes ahead and you are game.

regarding the earlier idea about reviewing open science tools... i was
thinking that perhaps a more focused activity than just broadly reviewing
tools, might be to do a deep dive into understanding workflows around open
peer review. that seems to be a core challenge the open science community
is trying to address right now.

there's peerevaluation.org, papercritic.com, hypothes.is (i don't know
exactly what format their system is proposing to take)... but also the
question of how we handle, recognize and incorporate reviews and comments
on blog posts, systems like arxiv.org, the PLoS system, and questions of
pre- and post- publication review, etc.

i think there's people on this list who are much more involved and familiar
with the ins and outs of these challenges than i am, but i feel like that
would be a useful session/activity. what do people think?

hi tom,

perhaps rufus or someone else could clarify about the pricing, since it is
a bit confusing... my interpretation was that thedatahub.org is free, at
least for individuals? alternatively, if not, i think it would be worth
setting one up as a free service for this purpose, and managing it as a
community...

 I really like the open peer review stuff too. The current prototype of
hypothes.is works like this: you have a browser plugin that you invoke on a
page you'd like to annotate, those annotations are stored in your account
at hypothes.is and are available to others browsing the page with the
plugin installed, according to the reputation and identity model. At this
stage, I would say it's just something to be aware of, not necessarily
something to design for, but I do like their plan for annotation servers
that will allow for a distributed architecture.

Thanks for bringing this up Jessy -- I've been meaning to post to the
list about CKAN and DataHub for a while. I've try and pull together a
really proper summary asap. But in the mean time to answer specific
queries.

That's definitely not your fault :-) -- we (being the Open Knowledge
Foundation CKAN / DataHub project) have done a pretty poor job telling
people about these tools :-)

Right, but just below is a section about http://theDataHub.org/ and
using it to host your datasets for you right now!

### Relation of theDataHub.org and CKAN

CKAN = software
theDataHub.org = Site (open to all) powered by CKAN

You probably care more about theDataHub than CKAN -- but if you were
journal or research group wanting to manage your own data then you
might be more interested in CKAN.

More info: thedatahub.org is the community data hub the Open Knowledge
Foundation run powered by CKAN (CKAN was in fact originally developed
just to power theDataHub.org but other people have found the software
useful hence that site!).

Simply put:

CKAN = Open Source Data Hub / Data Management System (DMS) Software
DataHub = Data Hub Site/Service - place where you host datasets and
work with data

Analogy with GitHub: DataHub is like GitHub and CKAN is like the
software that runs GitHub (unfortunately *not* opensource)

### What's the DataStore

Two types of things you usually want to store:

* Files (as blogs) -- be they data dumps, images, fMRI scans etc
* Structured data (i.e. data store in a database where you can access
individuals cells and rows)

DataStore is a feature of CKAN (and hence of the DataHub) that is does
the latter. From the docs [1]: "The CKAN [DataHub] DataStore provides
a database for structured storage of data together with a powerful
Web-accesible Data API, all seamlessly integrated into the CKAN
[DataHub] interface and authorization system."

[1]: <http://docs.ckan.org/en/latest/datastore.html> (there's also a
nice short slideshow)

The former feature is provided by the DataHub's (CKAN's) FileStore
where you can store whole files. The FileStore and DataStore
interconnect, if you upload a CSV file it will automatically get
imported into a DataStore table and become available via the web data
API. See more here:

http://ckan.org/2012/03/27/ckan-datastore-and-data-api/

DataHub is currently completely free (as in beer -- and is also free
as in freedom!). At some point we may need to introduce some kind of
charging model or run a funding drive to ensure sustainability [1] but
right now it costs absolutely nothing and we hope that for data (and
esp open data) under a certain size it will always remain so!

[1]: running a site where you store and serve lots of data costs
money, plus we want to add new features :-)

I am really keen we look at this oportunity. There is a huge and growing
demand for scientific data repositories and I'd like to see if CKAN/DataHub
can meet this. There has to be an Open offering so the OKF is the natural
place - who else?

So maybe we need a brainstorming day to work out what the problems are,
what we can offer and then - if they click - whether we can sell the idea
to receptive funders (RCUK, Wellcome - EBI, etc.)

FWIW I am giving a plenary at Rome next week on "Open Infrastructure for
Open Science" and if we had a clear position I could advertise it.

Peter is certainly right about the huge & growing demand for data
repositories.  Forgive the cut & paste below, but for US based among us at
least, the NSF has just put out a
call<http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2012/nsf12499/nsf12499.htm?WT.mc_id=USNSF_179>for
small ($250K) and medium ($1M) grants to do something like this.  In
my
opinion it's not a bad checklist.  Of course as this thread has already
highlighted, half of the battle is just knowing what's already out there
and getting it adopted...


   1. * E-science collaboration environments (ESCE).* A comprehensive "big
   data" cyberinfrastructure is necessary to allow for broad communities of
   scientists and engineers to have access to diverse data and to the best and
   most usable inferential and visualization tools. Potential research areas
   include, but are not limited to:


   - Novel collaboration environments for diverse and distant groups of
   researchers and students to coordinate their work (e.g., through data and
   model sharing and software reuse, tele-presence capability, crowdsourcing,
   social networking capabilities) with greatly enhanced efficiency and
   effectiveness for the scientific collaboration;
   - Automation of the discovery process (e.g., through machine learning,
   data mining, and automated inference);
   - Automated modeling tools to provide multiple views of massive data
   sets that are useful to diverse disciplines;
   - New data curation techniques for managing the complex and large flow
   of scientific output in a multitude of disciplines;
   - Development of systems and processes that efficiently incorporate
   autonomous anomaly and trend detection with human interaction, response,
   and reaction;
   - End-to-end systems that facilitate the development and use of
   scientific workflows and new applications;
   - New approaches to development of research questions that might be
   pursued in light of access to heterogeneous, diverse, big data;
   - New models for cross-disciplinary information fusion and knowledge
   sharing;
   - New approaches for effective data, knowledge, and model sharing and
   collaboration across multiple domains and disciplines;
   - Securing access to data using innovative techniques to prevent
   excessive replication of data to external entities;
   - Providing secure and controlled role-based access to centrally managed
   data environments;
   - Remote operation, scheduling, and real-time access to distant
   instruments and data resources;
   - Protection of privacy and maintenance of security in aggregated
   personal and proprietary data (e.g., de-identification);
   - Generation of aggregated or summarized data sets for sharing and
   analyses across jurisdictional and other end user boundaries; and
   - E-publishing tools that provide unique access, learning, and
   development opportunities.

I think of companies likeKitware - an Open Source company for whom I have
great respect. They are the sort of org that I think the NSF might be
thinking about. But I think we should also try to identify other US
contacts. My comments on the material below

And this is a major area. There is a desperate need for Open tools. But it
needs a lot of work

In Summary:
My own emphasis would be to stress the "long-tail" science. Big science
always gets the money. This should be a long-tail charter.

In case you are not aware :-) we already run an annotation service at
http://annotateit.org/ - there was big blog post announcing v1.0
yesterday: <http://blog.okfn.org/2012/04/03/annotateit-and-annotator/>

This is powered by the open-source Annotator tool the Foundation have
been developing for last few years: http://okfnlabs.org/annotator/ (JS
for doing web annotation)

We're actively working with Hypothes.is (they are using and
contributing to the Annotator tool) -- in contrast to annotateit.org
they are doing lots of work on the identity and filtering side of
things (whose annotations to show to the average person).

You can already run your own annotation server right now - part of the
Annotator suite is a reference backend implementation (that we use to
run AnnotateIt.org): <https://github.com/okfn/annotator-store>. Doing
real "distributed" would be some work (how would syncing work across
servers) but I note that the ultimate backend layer is ElasticSearch
which does sharding *very* nicely.

annotatorJS is one of my favourite tools. it's very needed, and beautifully
implemented.

sort of to peter's point in the other thread about developing open science,
having the technical solution doesn't mean we have a cultural solution, and
at the moment, IMHO, the main challenges for peer review are cultural and
procedural. having clear, alternative workflows for publication (eg., is it
publish --> review --> curate? or review --> curate --> publish? etc.),
relating that back to the sites studying and trying to measure impact, and
understanding (and designing) incentive structures for participation in
peer review process is still something that needs some serious love.... and
something that smart minds in the same room might be able to make some
progress on in helsinki :). if there were clear workflows and processes
that a larger community could get behind, then we might get some real
momentum.

my 2c,
jessy

Dear all,

 

A quick announcement about a new open data initiative and partnership at
BioMed Central. BMC has partnered with LabArchives
<http://www.labarchives.com/>  to work together for the shared goal of
making datasets supporting peer-reviewed publications available and
permanently linked to online publications - and available under terms
which permit reuse freely, as Open Data.

 

As part of this partnership, all BioMed Central authors are now entitled
to an enhanced free version of LabArchives
<http://www.labarchives.com/bmc/> . This 'BioMed Central Edition' of the
software offers additional storage capacity compared to the standard
free edition (100MB), integrated manuscript submission to BioMed Central
journals, along with open data publishing features.  These include the
ability to assign DOIs to published datasets and the use of the CC0
waiver for published data.

 

Read more about this on the BMC Blog:
http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/labarchives_and_b
iomed_central_a

And BMC's press release:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/presscenter/pressreleases/20120404

 

Please let me know if you've any comments.

 

Best regards,

 

Iain

Can you elaborate on whether or not there is a non-free version of
LabArchives, and what the implications of this are? It looks like this
might be more proprietary lock-in? Just checking.

Hi Bryan,

 

There is a paid version of LabArchives if users want more storage but
there's no obligation to use it, and datasets published and assigned
DOIs through the platform (free and paid) are available in perpetuity.
There is also no obligation for BMC authors to use LabArchives. But if
they do want to use it they will get an enhanced free product as part of
this partnership.

 

Hopefully the footnotes to and the full blog entry
<http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/labarchives_and_
biomed_central_a>  explain the situation.

 

Best,

 

Iain

 

"...

Permanence, citation and linking of datasets
In 2011 LabArchives introduced the ability to assign digital object
identifiers
<http://blog.labarchives.com/2011/04/19/labarchives-and-dois/>  (DOIs)
to datasets stored and shared with the software. DOIs facilitate data
citation, discovery and earning of academic credit for data publication,
and datasets assigned DOIs through LabArchives will remain available in
perpetuity. The DOI system is used by journal and data publishers, such
as DataCite members <http://datacite.org/members> , to ensure online
permanence of published articles. DOIs are indexed permanently by the
International DOI Foundation and are much more favorable than URLs for
permanently linking content online.

DOIs are assigned in LabArchives through the 'DOI Management' tab in the
software's share settings (pictured). DOIs should only be assigned in
instances in which data are to be permanently shared with the public.

A LabArchives user can choose to share a data set as it exists at the
time of publication, or they may enable users to continue to view
changes as they are made, while, importantly, maintaining the version
which supports a peer-reviewed publication. So, a DOI can be assigned to
data as of the time the article was published and authors or re-users of
the data may then continue with their research.

 

...

Footnotes

Use of LabArchives' software will have no influence on the editorial
decision to accept or reject a manuscript, and use of LabArchives or
similar data publishing services does not replace preexisting community
data deposition requirements set out in individual journals'
instructions for authors. 

The full version of LabArchives including 100GB of storage requires
payment <http://www.labarchives.com/pricing.php> . BioMed Central does
not receive any commission from LabArchives.

BioMed Central remains committed to work with all data repositories
which enable linking of data to publications particularly where specific
journals and communities endorse them - such as for example the Dryad
repository <http://datadryad.org/> , with which we are working towards
submission system integration with BMC Ecology and BMC Evolutionary
Biology. More information on data deposition requirements relevant to
BioMed Central's journals can be found on our supporting data resources
page <http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/supportingdata> ."

Just to nail down this term of art: I'm guessing "data curation"
denotes "managing a data collection," no? and "curating open data"
connotes activities like, e.g.,

* securing public availability
** positive: ensuring public access, backup
** negative: preventing unauthorized modification, theft, DoS
* enhancing public access
** providing identifiers (whether, e.g., DOIs or Plain Old URIs)
** submitting to other collections

Or am I very confused? If not, I claim curation of some sort is
required for all but the most trivial and unscalable review:

Consider this narrative: I get a dataset, it looks important, I invest
work in assimilating it, exploring it, and generating visualizations,
I strengthen my hunch. At this point, I seek "review" or "publication"
in at least the minimal sense of saying "hey, look @ this" to peers.
For which I'm gonna wanna

- put the data (et al) somewhere accessible yet safe
- send pointers to peers

Does that not mean, I want some data curation?

Furthermore, suppose that, after that informal process, I and my 
peer consultants agree the dataset and derived products (et al) is
good enough to "get a pub" (whether poster, article, technical report,
whatever). Certainly I would then want the dataset curated, e.g., 
for linking from a paper (at least, as supporting information), no?

Therefore, the flow should be [curate, review, publish], because
curation promotes review. (And IMHO "review," of which "peer-reviewed
publication" as we know it is a ceremonial subset, is that from which
the goodness of scientific openness flows--but that is of course a
much stronger claim.)

FWIW, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

Indeed I am aware as it was discussed at the hypothes.is reputation and
identity workshop and I have it on my toolbar!  To Jessy/Peter's point,
however, I haven't made it part of my workflow for anything yet. Tools and
practices co-evolve and it seems to me that the tools side of annotation is
currently ahead of the practices side. What are the clearest and most
compelling use cases right now?

The Digital Curation Centre defines digital curation as "maintaining,
preserving and adding value to digital research data throughout its
lifecycle." The DCC's digital curation lifecycle model includes these
steps: conceptualise, create, access and use, appraise and select,
dispose, ingest, preservation action, reappraise, store, access and
reuse, and transform.  See http://bit.ly/9pkCTk.

The Digital Curation and Preservation Bibliography 2010 (OA PDF
available) provides coverage of the literature: http://bit.ly/hPJwm0.

The primary link
http://data.nature.com/
appears to have disappeared. Hard to imagine that happening.

Peter's right about metadata. One of the hardest nuts to crack re:
data repositories and making data more discoverable seems to be
metadata--how do we get scientists to supply metadata without creating
more work for them, and how do we easily convert subject specific
metadata formats into more general formats (or vice versa).

Creating a tool (or building the capability into a larger tool) that
would automate any part of that process for researchers in a specific
subject area(s) would be quite valuable. Better crowdsourcing tools,
as Peter points out, could also be a good lead. Or maybe building that
mythical add-on to scientific instruments that would automatically
extract relevant metadata (which William Gunn talked about in his Open
Science Summit 2012 talk) could be a good direction to move?

Or perhaps a discipline-specific virtual archive (a la SEAD
http://sead-data.net/) that would pull datasets from a variety of
repositories (national, institutional, subject repos, etc) in an
automated fashion, to centralize research and build upon existing data
(and allow other researchers to add their own metadata that's relevant
to their discipline)? If we were to build upon existing repositories
in a novel way, and do it in a manner that was less hands-on than
SEAD, it would address the above NSF C4P in a few ways. Also, if we
could build an open tool that others could easily adapt for other
disciplines, it would be a pretty Big Deal.

It works for me. Congrats to Nature!

I hope the supplementary data, and text mining results are next!

The links work for me.

It appears to be primarily the metadata for papers since 1869 -- authors,
page numbers, etc.  I mean, not that you can't have fun showing how number
of authors increases over time, or length of papers have gotten shorter,
but does not even seem to include citation graph.  I haven't dug very far
though, maybe there is more here?

still, a nice idea and nice API for it.

"We have permission to mine Nature. Naomi will post the letters.  I don't
think the small print is a killer."

Agreed, and for the second time of late, "I find that highly logical".

Right--the question I'm getting at is how do we make your entering that
data even easier, and how do we keep the metadata from getting lost? We
build systems that are more interoperable (to replicate and make
discoverable  both data and its metadata).

For those that are interested and might now know about it. The Knowledge Media Institute at The Open University in partnership with the Koninklijke Bibliotheek  are investigating automated ways of extracting/mining data and metadata from research output via the DiggiCore project

The tragedy is, scientists DO create this metadata: every online
submission system I've ever used has required me to enter authors and
addresses, keywords, number of figures, etc.  Yet that all gets thrown
away once the Holy PDF has been made.

Hi,

I am following this discussion with great interest.
The ideas that are described concerning Escience collaborating communities
match the views that I have expressed in my blog on open science
communities<http://access.okfn.org/2012/03/20/scientific-social-networks-are-the-future-of-science/>on
access.okfn.org.
In my view we could build such an infrastructure using the @ccess
communities proposed on our website and possibly an @ccess foundation
funded by external parties lke EU, Welcome, Gates Foundation etc.
These ideas are part of the strategy behind the @ccess initiative.

DiggiCore looks like a great project. If we could do something similar
for datasets, rather than publications, it could be a coup.

Yes indeed! Perhaps I could mention this submission that I threw
together for the Open Repositories conference OR12
(http://or2012.ed.ac.uk):

http://ckan.okfnpad.org/or12

My idea was that we could boot a new instance of ckan specialised for
research papers (slightly facetiously called thepaperhub.org), but I
don't know how easy this is, or whether there would be enthusiasm from
someone technically literate to keep it running. (Volunteers?)
Meantime thedatahub.org is a good option.

I gather OR12 will be accepting/rejecting submissions on 16 April, incidentally.

Mark

Will these pages automatically be marked as notable? That is, we've
recently seen editors remove pages that in their opinion were not
notable enough... is a protein observed in a single article notable?
What happens if it gets marked for removal at some point?

Hi Egon,

the articles are being written in accordance (as much as is feasible
at least) with the guidelines of both the journal and the English
Wikipedia. That includes notability criteria and thus the choice of
the article's scope in the first place. We will also invite
WikiProject Computational Biology to review the draft (which is public
on a CC BY-licensed MediaWiki instance).

So while we cannot exclude that such articles will be the subject of
deletion discussions, the probability for that to happen is lower than
for the average science article on the English Wikipedia. And should
the page become deleted at some point, we still have the version of
record from the journal.

Cheers,

Daniel

Do you think this will start happening more and more? Also for other
fields and thus other journals? I can expect other journal already to
be lining up, if only for the extra exposure...

As well as the Guardian today, there was also a 6 minute slot on BBC Radio 4
http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/console/b01ddxcs  ~24 mins in, discussing Open
Access.


The issue is clearly going mainstream.
This program also asked for listener feedback on this issue:
"if you have a view on this... please email us at pm at bbc.co.uk"

may I suggest we send them our opinions on the benefits of Open Access, and
the injustices of toll-access?

Peter, when you mention it, you could perhaps add that a bit of
funding is available for other journals to do something similar - see
last paragraph in my blog post.

Thanks,

Hi Egon,

I do not see journals lining up yet, but as just mentioned in the mail
to Peter, I do have some funds to make experimenting a bit sweeter for
other journals too:

do people think a separate instance of ckan would be useful for the open
data/science community at large? or is it an issue of marketing what we
have (thedatahub) better?

if the former, i'm happy to help w system administration, but it's not
obvious to me... curious what others think!

	implications for data storage
Message-ID: <CAH6Pt5oCOGBbbDLKTsmZX5LrtnKxKmWA_6c8GmPAr+ac4ERjuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I just wanted to point out this paper in case y'all have not seen it:

http://ged.msu.edu/papers/2012-diginorm/

In particular see here for instructions on running the code yourself,
on Amazon's web services:

http://ged.msu.edu/angus/diginorm-2012/pipeline-notes.html

The short story is that the Amazon virtual machine images and public
data storage allow you to run the exact analysis used for the figures
in the paper.

Starcluster [1] and the IPython notebook and parallel machinery [2]
makes it much easier to use Amazon clusters for this purpose.

According to the author, setting this up was relatively easy:

http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/apr-12/replication-i.html

My question was - what implication does this have for sites dedicated
to data storage?  Is practical data storage going to have to live in
the same network as the cloud CPUs on which we run the analysis?  And
will the data storage have to include virtual machine images?

Thanks for any thoughts,

Matthew

To explain a little, I thought a separate instance could be
specialised in simple ways, e.g. having standard fields for extra
authors, affiliations, journal, etc - whatever people would find most
useful. (And perhaps also in more complicated ways, using CKAN
references to implement citations; I'm not sure how easy/feasible this
is, but I could ask the CKAN technical folk for advice.)

If people think this a good idea your offer could be  very useful!

Mark

Yes.  Computations have to be taken to Big Data (a term whose
applicability gradually shifts over time and depends on context;
currently people generally use it to mean petabyte or above, but
moving the computations to the data is often a good trade-off for
anything over a few tens of gigabytes, or even less).  This requires
providing a compute engine of some sort at the data, and virtualising
that engine is usually the most efficient approach for that (not
always: virtualising an ASIC system such as Anton - used for molecular
dynamics - will lose you several orders of magnitude in performance,
but I'm not aware of anyone offering specialist hardware like that at
big data repositories).  There are lots of different sorts of engines
one might virtualise, and for big datasets one could even devise a
specialised one, but very often the winning strategy is going to be to
follow the mass computational herd and go for a virtualised
intel-based machine (or virtualised cluster thereof).

There are other approaches, depending on the typical computation
dependencies: if it's only going to use thin slices of the data then
you can send queries to the data and stream the slices back to the
computation.  But in many fields (climate science, astronomy,
genomics, doubtless others), people are building infrastructure for
taking computations to data.

I think we should have a separate science-datahub.. I showed datahub to the

to play devil's advocate :)

i think sites like github and wordpress and all the other defacto hosted
tools are successful specifically *because* they cross community
boundaries, and as a result encourage cross pollination and collaboration,
and focus efforts and (human/dollar) support. if there were are data hubs
for each possible community, then i'm worried we just end up with
fragmentation of efforts, and confusion on the part of the user ("gee, do i
post to the CS data hub or the web development data hub? oh whatever i'll
just do it later.").

on the other hand, as scientists posting to sites like thedatahub, we
actually increase exposure to our data and probability of re-use/re-mixing,
and hopefully help to dispel the notion that there is anything mysterious
or special about "real" scientists' data. we're right in there with the
data nerds and the software developers and the database admins and the non
profits and the inter-governmentals sharing and refining and asking
questions about their data. seems better for us all...

to be clear, if we need more human resources to support operations or scale
up what thedatahub.org is capable of handling, i think we should definitely
do that and am happy to help on the sysadmin side, but IMHO we would reap
greater rewards by creating a defacto place on the web that does this well
for all, than by setting up a separate community.

my 2c!

What implications do you see for smaller organizations like the OKF
and sites like http://thedatahub.org/ ?

To carry this thread a step further...

I suspect most researchers will be apt to use something if they can be
convinced that it's already accepted for use by the scientific community --
whether or not it's specifically designed for scientists.  I'd agree with
Jessy -- the internet is littered with projects that have tried to be a
"facebook for scientists" a "github for scientists" etc, which are largely
unsuccessful when the impression is that "no researcher I know & respect
uses that". Meanwhile, I've seen many skeptics go from "know
self-respecting researcher would use twitter" to "look at all these
well-respected researchers using twitter!  I better get on the boat"

I believe that having funders and journals visibly support, recommend, or
require the use of a particular repository is also essential.  This has
certainly helped repositories such as Dryad and figshare.  Meanwhile,
alternate solutions will have to distinguish themselves from other players
in this field, and the different repositories need to interact seemlessly
so researchers don't have to worry about which one to submit to.  The
DataONE project is probably a leading example of these efforts.

So, perhaps we don't need a thedatahub.org for science, perhaps we do.
What we really need, though, is established researchers using the service
and funders and publishers recommending or requiring it.

The Amazon S3 business mentioned on another recent thread is probably an
important as well, at least for very large datasets.  With examples like
Titus's, or more visibly, NIH's recent announcement of freely hosting the 1000
Genomes dataset <http://aws.amazon.com/1000genomes/> there (200 terabytes),
this seems like an important player.  Perhaps thedatahub.org could simply
provide the option for data to post to Amazon S3, instead of their own
servers?  Alternatively something like
globusonline<https://www.globusonline.org/>with its terabyte/hr
transfer rates could help to approach big data the old
fashion way (as used by the US DOE supercomputing centers to share data).

I've just started exploring thedatahub.org myself.  The API (essential if I
am to be able to incorporate this into my workflow) looks great but is
giving me a few challenges.  AmazonS3 has the advantage of a much wider
developer community building tools to interact with its data storage,
though somewhat of a disadvantage in cost...  I'd be curious to here the
experiences of others...

Yes.

And is the data static? That's much easy to manage as a one-off cost.

I noticed that the data set from the paper I was pointing to was a few
GB in size, but still on Amazon because that's where the CPUs were.

Will we have to use Amazon for our reproducible science?  If practical
reproducibility will need virtual machines and cluster computing, do
you see any prospect of this kind of infrastructure being available as
an open service?  What about OpenStack?  But then, who will pay for
the infrastructure?  Or should universities be funding labs to pay
Amazon?

Best,

Matthew

Yes, probably OpenStack, or a close relation.  There seem to be some
other candidates, such as CloudStack.

As for who pays, well, if you're going to be doing some computation,
somebody somewhere is going to pay for the power, the hardware
depreciation, the infrastructure, the staffing.  As Peter says, the
cost to the provider is very low: even at Amazon the retail cost is
fairly low, and the retail prices are surely only going to go down.
If you group together with other users you can get bulk discounts or
even operate your own facility.  If you avoid closed-source
dependencies, you can cheaply migrate to another provider so free
market should operate efficiently.  I am sure that there are vertical
market opportunities for entrepreneurs, selling specialised
data+computation cloud services to science communities, and I presume
that those niches are already filling up.

Is there anyone you know of who is involved in planning such a system

To further muddy the waters, I note that BMC has made a
deal<http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/labarchives_and_biomed_central_a>with
this outfit called LabArchives to host datasets (limited to 100MB per
author, not publication) for BMC papers. One benefit of focusing the
resources on a small number of players would be to reduce this sort of
confusion.

Subject: [open-science] github/R stack for the nomadic researcher -
	permanence?
Message-ID: <CADOXZMx-hfkVacGNsUHxB+2PUU2ZJh7bKpfBa15nnPK++E-Gsw@mail.gmail.com>

All,

This point may have been made already in the cascade of mails (no longer
grouped?) on this subject, but we're dealing with this issue of data for
our open projects right now.

All our primary data on the schisto and drug discovery projects are shared
through Labtrove's electronic lab notebook. While we post new experiments
every day (i.e. the content changes) *we are required by law to keep the
data essentially forever*. This is because the data involve experimental
science, and as part of safety regulations we are required to keep lab
books for 70 years after the completion of the relevant procedure (i.e.
forever). I would urge any open scientist to look into this - their
university/institution/country probably has similar requirements. Ours come
from New South Wales state law. I can forward the relevant clause if anyone
desperately wants to see it.

Now I'm in the middle of talking with Australian data guys (at NeCTAR - the
cloud data service specifically designed for things like this) about
permanent backup of our data. If for some reason NeCTAR goes under, or we
need to pay NeCTAR and cannot, then it would be my responsibility to ensure
my University backs up the data. There aren't clear routes for this, so I
have no clear answers. It's important because if I don't keep the data I
could be liable years down the track.

If I tell my University adminstrators that I am using a commercial service
to back up my data (data which have arisen from government-funded research)
they will tell me that that is not good enough, and will ask me what
happens if the company I am using goes bust in 30 years' time. That the
University has no viable alternative won't be a productive argument - I
will be told to continue using paper lab books until there is a better
alternative. Hence for me it's important that the data I generate are
stored in some "official" system, meaning a composite of national and
library archives.

I flag this up just because I've had to look fairly far into this because
of the nature of the open, paperless data we're generating. I know a
commercial service will not be looked upon kindly. Clearly (I hasten to
add) I don't necessarily agree with this. Clearly commercial services (such
as Mark's wonderful Figshare) are useful for sharing nimbly and
effectively, and other things we're using for our open science projects
(like G+ and Twitter) are not archived but are still great and useful in a
way that an archive is not. But *permanence of the repository use to house
the raw data* (i.e. the electronic lab notebook needed for open science)
and *contingency plans for the repository's failure* need to be in place
for us to have a general solution that could gain traction. My feeling is
that data arising from University-generated research needs to be managed by
the University through support of something like a national service. That's
slowly happening in Australia right now, and I hope elsewhere.

...unless other services are able to guarantee their existence in 70 years'
time, in which case: problem solved.

Cheers,

Mat

Mat,
Many thanks for this - we are wrestling with science data as part of the
EU's Horizon2020 framework and I shall use your mail as an example. It's a
great example (unfortunately) of what happens when the law strikes. There
is no way round laws except by getting them changed.

I think my colleagues in Horizon2020 would be very keen to see this. If it
is generally applicable and if it likely to be invoked then it puts a huge
burden on the institution.

The pharma companies have spent zillions on this sort of problem. See
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_21_CFR_Part_11 which is about drug
submissions. That's what the change to electronic does for you.

Incidentally, though I thought an instance specialised for research
publications might be helpful, I wouldn't particularly suggest
fragmenting it by discipline (science, etc).

Carl, glad that your first impressions of the CKAN API are good. If it
is also causing you problems you might want to report/discuss them on
the CKAN lists:

http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-dev
http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-discuss

For technical questions/problems, the -dev list is best.

Regards,

Mark

(apologies for multiple posts; please forward; please email
i-challenge2012_a_t_easychair.**org<http://i-challenge2012_a_t_easychair.org>for
questions)
********************
NEWS:
- Deadline extension until April 25th, 2012
- The total amount of 2,000 EUR (sponsored by Wolters Kluwer) will be
awarded in prizes and split among the most promising applications.
- Linked Data Cup Board updated: http://i-challenge.blogs.aksw.**

********************
Linked Data Cup 2012
http://i-challenge.blogs.aksw.**org/ <http://i-challenge.blogs.aksw.org/>
co-located with the I-Semantics 2012
Graz, Austria, 5 - 7 September 2012
http://www.i-semantics.at
********************
The yearly organised Linked Data Cup (formerly Triplification Challenge)
awards prizes to the most promising innovation involving linked data. Four
different technological topics are addressed: triplification, interlinking,
cleansing, and application mash-ups. The Linked Data Cup invites scientists
and practitioners to submit novel and innovative (5 star) linked data sets
and applications built on linked data technology.
Although more and more data is triplified and published as RDF and linked
data, the question arises how to evaluate the usefulness of such
approaches. The Linked Data Cup therefore requires all submissions to
include a concrete use case and problem statement alongside a solution
(triplified data set, interlinking/cleansing approach, linked data
application) that showcases the usefulness of linked data. Submissions that
can provide measurable benefits of employing linked data over traditional
methods are preferred.
Note that the call is not limited to any domain or target group. We accept
submissions ranging from value-added business intelligence use cases to
scientific networks to the longest tail [1] of information domains. The
only strict requirement is that the employment of linked data is very well
motivated and also justified (i.e. we rank approaches higher that provide
solutions, which could not have been realised without linked data, even if
they lack technical or scientific brilliance). The total amount of 2,000
EUR (sponsored by Wolters Kluwer) will be awarded in prizes and split among
the most promising applications.

Evaluation Criteria
===================
The submissions will be initially evaluated with a well-known five star
ranking system [2]. Furthermore, entries will be assessed according to the
extent to which they
1. motivate the relevancy of their use case for their respective domain;
2. justify the adequacy of linked data technologies for their solution;
3. demonstrate that all alternatives to linked data would have resulted in
an inferior solution;
4. provide an evaluation that can measure the benefits of linked data

Topics
======
Ideas for topics include (but are not limited to):
* Improving traditional approaches with help of linked data
* Linked data use in science and education
* Linked data supported multimedia applications
* Linked data in the open source context
* Web annotation
* Generic applications
* Internationalization of linked data
* Visualization of linked data
* Linked government data
* Business models based on linked data
* Recommender systems supported by linked data
* Integrating microposts with linked data
* Distributed social web based on linked data
* Linked data sensor networks

Submission and Reviewing
========================
Submissions to the Linked Data Cup will be reviewed by members of the
Linked Data Cup Board and invited experts from the Linked Data community.
Submissions should consist of 4 pages and must be original and must not
have been submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers should follow the ACM
ICPS guidelines for formatting as accepted submissions will be published in
the I-SEMANTICS 2012 proceedings in the digital library of the ACM ICP
series. Please read the submission page[a] for detailed information on how
to submit.
Important Dates (Linked Data Cup)
1. Paper Submission Deadline: April 25, 2012
2. Notification of Acceptance: May 21, 2012
3. Camera-Ready Paper: June 11, 2012

Subject: [open-science] Collaborative Citizen Science Hub?
Message-ID: <CAJ7nv3HAN_hMfHqVWAyLNe7aNrPO17iKuTU7tKJ_0sDh8afDag@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Due to the increasing interest in citizen science, a project hub/directory
is highly demanded. For now, we've thought of an open directory
and collaboration tool to share citizen science projects openly as open in
open source. Maybe, we can start up with open specs of our projects and
allow other users to be able to remake these tools and collaborate the
existing.

Projects should be in scientific context and could enable community to do
more science. An open spec of a radio telescope may be a good fit as a
project, since it's feasible and it's an enabler, for instance.

A cultural shift is already happening with science hack days, DIY bio and
genom communities. Trying to gather the tools and data from these discrete
organizations will be outstanding to show the existing momentum and attract
others.

I've started a wiki called makesci [1] (make for makers and sci for
science) and trying to build up a base community to understand the demands.
At the moment, I'm collecting project proposals to feature. If you have
any possibilities to contribute, could you please make a proposal on
http://bit.ly/HQWsXs?

I'm also looking forward to hear your thoughts on how citizen science
should move.

Regards,
Burcu Dogan

Why not use the already existing wikis like appropedia, reprap's wiki,
makerbot's wiki, the hackerspaces.org wiki, the diybio wiki on
openwetware, or OSE's wiki? I don't understand how a separate wiki is
necessary for this.

Burcu,

Do you know about SciStarter? It is a pretty comprehensive directory of
citizen science projects: http://scistarter.com/about.html
Or are you proposing a directory of a different kind?

agreed there's a bunch out there already, although scistarter does come
across as being oriented mostly towards children. it would be awesome to
see more of an adult (and/or age-agnostic) offering as well. what about
chatting to them about extending the site?

Hi All

The deadline for stream proposals is approaching so please add your ideas
to the Etherpad in as much detail as you can over the next couple of
days! The festival co-ord team are particularly keen for sessions to take
place in various formats, not just the traditional talk or panel, so get
creative!
http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

The final edits will take place on Thursday night and Friday morning before
the proposal is submitted.

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] Extracting and indexing information from scientific
 literature ("the PDF Cow")
Message-ID: <CAD2k14OtYJ6UqqEYFLO_Zb16UgvcvaEx4vcBaZcTnupCH_nMAA@mail.gmail.com>

For several years I have been involved in trying to extract information
from "PDFs", which are the primary way that much science is published.
Although many of these are "controlled" by publishers (and that's why we
are challenging them) many are CC-BY or CC0. This mail is about developing
the technology, because if that's solved then it becomes easier to convince
people of the need to give us the rights.

Extracting information from general PDFs is impossible, and likened to
"converting a hamburger back to a cow" (I am sometimes credited with this
aphorism but I didn't create it). A generic PDF may be a bitmap, contain
only vector strokes, and may have "order backwards in words". However for
scientific publications which are largely mechanised there is quite a lot
that can be done.

A lot of people have thrown themselves at this, and it's a time sink.
However the technology is gradually getting better and I am reasonably
confident that certain information can be fairly well extracted. For
example it is possible to extract chemical structures from certain types of
images and also graphs and spectra.

Many of the previous efforts have either ended up lost or incorporated in
closed programs. I am wondering if there is a critical mass of people who
are sufficiently interested that we can collate resources and experience in
this area. Because otherwise everyone ends up reinventing it.

hey all,

just added an idea for "flash mob peer review" on the pad, pasted below.
basically a fun, hands-on and in-person open peer review session with an
included user study (tho no reason we couldn't support remote participants
if the tools were online). curious for ideas or improvements on the two
approaches suggested.

jenny, how does the writing up of the proposals work - are we expected to
write these up for formally or is that what you guys are going to do with
the pad thursday and friday?

jessy


*Flash Mob Peer Review* (post or pre publication?)
- have people submit article(s) ahead of the conference for peer review.
describe the plan and emphasize that this will be a fun way for them to
help experiment with new mechanisms in science/peer review. and will also
be quite public.
- over the course of the festival, have set times where groups of people
attend a "flash" peer review session (hmm perhaps flash is the wrong word-
don't want to imply lack of thoughtfullness?).
- *two possible approaches:* 1. choose a different, specific tool/site for
each flash review session, to understand different reactions to different
tools. 2. just let people have at it and see what they use. impt that
whatever tools we choose to use can be parallelizable. perhaps just
annotatejs?
- user study: interview each participant after each session and document
feedback on what worked and what didn't. write this up and share with the
community.
- IMHO this would be interesting for both pre- and post-publication but
would be particularly interested to see how authors felt it helped improve
their work pre-publication.
- perhaps have an iteration mechanism, even during the conference?

I currently having a team that is aiming to index >99% of science,
including PDFs. But naturally it's not very public at the moment. In
general, the approach is to get metadata from the publishers because,
frankly, OCR is magic. Tesseract doesn't work. OCR doesn't work. Why
on earth would any OCR program think []><>*#!^&()__-- appears so often
in English text? That's not right at all.

peter/all, a friend showed me PDF.js the other day, and i was quite blown
away. a library for converting and rendering pdfs as html5 canvas elements,
complete with fancy fonts and everything. AFAIU it's still under
development, but here's the site:
http://andreasgal.com/2011/06/15/pdf-js/

and here's their demo:
http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/web/viewer.html

similarly, another friend, stian hacklev, has been looking into similarity
hashing for research papers.
http://reganmian.net/wiki/fuzzy_text_matching?
http://moultano.wordpress.com/article/simple-simhashing-3kbzhsxyg4467-6/

it seems like there's a lot of interest in this topic but many disparate
efforts. with a bit more coordination, i bet some great momentum could be
generated.

Thanks Jessy!
Laura and I are chatting to Kat and Jussi from the OKFest team tomorrow to
confirm what we need to do and then we'll tidy up/formalise the pad and
transfer it to the OKFest form on Friday so no need to write up formally.

Keep the great ideas coming everyone!

Jenny

I don't understand this. Are you running a closed company? If so, good luck
but I am only interested in Open collaboration at this stage. This isn't
for moralistic reasons but because it is only by having open code that we
can make sufficient progress.

And indexing is more than publisher metadata (which actually can be
extracted by several means). It's about domain-specific searching - e.g. we
can search patents for chemistry in chemical language.

No, it's not a company. Can we chat about the details over skype/phone sometime?
(+1) 512-203-0507 or skype "kanzure"

I am rather disappointed by the current state of the chemical
representation scene... smiles, frowns, pydaylight, but nothing under
active development? Maybe Blue Obelisk or CDK has something that I am
forgetting.

Hi all,

Jenny, Tom Olijhoek and I will be chatting to the OKFest team in about half
an hour (4:30pm BST). If you would like to be more involved in the planning
at this stage, please do drop me and line and you'd be very welcome to join
the call!

Otherwise the three of us will work on tidying the ideas in the etherpad
into proposal format this evening. We can continue to plan further once we
(hopefully!) have approval from the main OKFest team :)

Cheers,
Laura

Hi everyone,

The OKFest etherpad is coming into shape! See:
http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

I think we have an (almost) final version now. Please do feel free to read
through and make any further edits in the next few hours. I will take a
final look later this afternoon and then submit around 5pm BST.

Thanks for all your help!
Laura

Subject: [open-science] Open Science for the 21st century
Message-ID: <CABPM+wrgETW4cop-xuAJhEY8VwxuN6fSeXUHsyupt5X1c=VBBw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

If you haven't already seen this declaration from ALLEA (ALL European
Academies: The European Federation of National Academies of Sciences and
Humanities) on Open Science for the 21st century, it is very positive and
worth a quick read (it's only 3 pages)
http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/e-infrastructure/docs/allea-declaration-1.pdf

It states:
The Academies commit themselves to debate and promote practical
applications of open science principles within their national arenas of
activity, and to jointly advocate their adoption also in the international
domain.

Specifically:
- The European Commission proposes that under ?Horizon 2020?, the successor
to FP7, all research results are to be made available and accessible for
everyone.

They also recommend:
- Publications should be made openly available online, as soon and as
freely as possible, as should also educational resources and software
resulting from publicly funded research.
- Scientists and their organisations should apply open sharing principles
to the data that underpins such publications
- Consequently, research proposals requesting public funds should include
measures aimed at advancing open science and apply the above principles.
- Academic assessment and reward systems should see merit in participation
in the culture of sharing, in enabling online collaboration and
reproducible e-science.

We look forward to seeing strong action on the points raised in the
document.

Jenny

Given that it is only 3 pages, and contains absolutely nothing that justifies it being a PDF, it would be nice start if they published the darn thing in plain text.

Harrruummmpphhhh bum.

Yes - one things that we are starting to need is a handbook / toolkit for
this.  An overview of the tools that you and others have developed.

This was the meeting I was invited to in Rome and where I met Neelie Kroes
(and put in a plug for OKFN, which seems to have been unnecessary).
Basically she and others are moving the digital agenda ahead and it will
involve, in part, bottom up organisations like OKFN. There is still a lot
of confusion about green/gold/openAccess and I think we have to keep
plugging simple messages.

Subject: [open-science] feedback wanted on text-mining initiatives
Message-ID: <CAOeaCi+r+OwAhOQMaF76TJ9kS9v4zBzmKXWPJMicc4CJ8WTcag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Open Science,

There is growing interest in text-mining rights.  I'm in the middle of a
bit of it, and would love some feedback and community.

Briefly, due to a twitter conversation, Elsevier and I began to talk about
updating the subscription contract of the University of British Columbia to
explicitly include text-mining rights.  The rights Elsevier has agreed to
are more broad than they've agreed to with other institutions, as far as I
know (tell me if I'm wrong!), and more broad than those of most publishers.
 More information<http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2012/04/17/elsevier-agrees/>
.

In the mean time, PMR and others are asserting text-mining rights and going
ahead.  This is another approach and I'm glad they are doing it.

I've drafted a short "text-mining
manifesto"<http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2012/04/19/do-we-need-manifesto/>if
you will...  how researchers expect to be able to access and process
the
accessing the literature to which we have access.   How to improve this
statement, and what to do with it next?

As indicated by a recent stock analysis
report<http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2012/04/20/new-fron/> on
Elsevier, the time for pressing ahead with this is NOW.   I happen to know
there is media attention in the wings.

Comments, suggestions, opinions, volunteers, etc.... let's dig in.

Heather

I have just submitted our proposal for an Open Science Stream - fingers
crossed we will get allocated plenty of time and space at OKFest :)

Thanks to everyone who has contributed ideas so far. Once we hear back from
the organisers about how many slots they can allocate us, I'm sure there'll
be opportunities to refine our plans further.

Thanks all, enjoy your weekends!
Laura

Tried to respond on your blog but for some reason WordPress doesn't
like my login any more.  Anyway, I was commenting to encourage you to
broaden it.  For instance are "aggregate statistical" results the only
kind of fact that text-miners might want to publish?  Also, to
strengthen the wording.  It took me several drafts of the Science Code
Manifesto to get to the bald statements of "must".

Hi Heather,

for our fulltext mining project here (we are trying get most of
PubMed), we are asking for ~200 letters around entities of interest
that we've found in the text ("snippets") which is what Google Scholar
shows, too. Once they have a hit, people could always use Google
Scholar to get the flanking text anyways.

The biggest problem for me is contact information of publishers. There
are so many of them, some have been bought up, some have vanished,
often permissions@<publisher>.com doesn't reply, it's a slow struggle.

You know our website already, it's at http://text.soe.ucsc.edu. I keep
updating the list of publishers and contacts for text mining
permissions. Happy about any comments or for contact information of
publishers.

cheers
Max

Heather this is great,
I tried to respond to your blog but could. so please publish this as if I
had.

"This is a great idea, Heather. It is important to state what we want and
what we believe we have a right to, not just what we can 'negotiate' or do
without being sued. There are fundamental rights and we should aim for them.

A finished manifesto will require some communal work. Firstly it must cover
multiple jurisdictions (e.g. "fair use" is irrelevant in UK law, and in any
case Larry Lessig simple describes it as a right to go to court (or
similar).

It's extremely important that we don't get so excited that we give away
stuff that actually is ours. For example I will argue that *all* factual
data is de facto mineable and is only prevented by publisher contracts. We
should also address the problem (if any) of server overload - it is easily
manageable by caches. I am particularly concerned about other-than-text -
much of my current work is on diagrams.

So a short, tight, non-nonsense manifesto is exactly what is required. Like
Panton Principles and the Principles pf Open Bibliography.

And we have a number of people in OKF who are very interested.
"

So as you say this is the time - we should aim to get something out as
quickly as we can without losing the fundamental principles. That's not
easy, but it's possible

I'm scheduled for a conference call on Wednesday with the organizers
of the Rome event (which I missed due to #OAPoland). Suggestions on
what to bring up are most welcome.

My wish list, fwiw:

1) ALLEA should encourage its members to adopt re-use permissions that are compatible with the most liberal of other permission regimes.  Institutions that customize their policies on sharing data (such as by adding a non-commercial use restriction or requiring that share-alike conditions be adopted) can impede the maximum re-use of such work.  Time spent figuring out permissions is costly to the individual researcher and even more so to the institutions that have to clear rights for larger numbers of personnel.   Keep it simple; keep it interoperable.

2) Be aware of other types of legislation that can affect the freedom to share scientific research (e.g., the Communications Bills, SOPAs and PIPAs that add ever-more intrusive layers of protection for  owners of intellectual property).  These efforts are generally being proposed by industries that rely heavily on copyright royalties and therefore want piracy eliminated.  They define "piracy" as broadly as possible.  Researchers, on the other hand, rarely collect royalties on their journal articles and would much rather their works were distributed as widely as possible.  SOPA-type legislation makes  it even harder for those who want to re-use scientific data to legally do so. 

3)  Substitute the sui generis database protection for legislation that places raw numerical and text data (tricky as it is to define) in the public domain

And vice versa for me (I missed the Polish event through being in Rome).
I'd be happy to skype and compare notes.

Excellent.  I particularly welcome the mention of software as a
research product deserving full open publication.

Great suggestions!  (sorry comments on the blog weren't working, not sure
why, will keep investigating.)

I met with UBC librarians yesterday.  They are excited about codifying
these expectations into a text-mining addendum that they can use as a model
agreement with all publishers.  They suggested I spearhead contacting other
publishers.  I'm going to be busy with that for the next little while.

Does anyone else want to pick up the statement and run with pulling
together these comments, driving to a community "short, tight, non-nonsense
manifesto"?

I have already contacted 6 other publishers and will be publishing the
results very soon.

I think it's absolutely critical this does not get fragmented and there is
a single statement. The great danger is making it too weak. I'll try to
find time today to put some points on this list.

We should remember that this must be international as legal jurisdictions
vary.

For those interested in #altmetics , worth checking out is the yet to be publicly released Altmetic Explorer.

Go to http://altmetric.com/index.php and then go to the section "We're launching soon!"

Enter your email address and hit subscribe.

After a couple of emails, like me, you should be able to try it out and provide feedback ahead of the public launch.

Best,

Graham

Jessy,

In the words of Peter Suber (on an unrelated matter), I would say that all three similar tools "are complementary and synergistic" !!

Hi Heather and Peter,

the comment function on the blog is still broken, so here is a comment
on your post:

Having a standard clause for this is definitely one step forward, just
today the American Assoc of Immunology was asking for a standard
clause to add to their license and I have trouble coming up with
something general enough... what shall we ask the library to add to
AAI license to allow text mining for everyone ? I will work something
out, but any comments are welcome...

It is not correct that only Elsevier allows text mining in their (new)
license. Some other publishers have been allowing text mining for a
while, when the institution that negotiates the license has made that
part of the agreement. Sage and Mary-Ann Liebert are examples for
these, they allow text mining for the University of California, and
maybe many others. Some publishers allow text mining in their general
license, like the AACR or the Royal Society of Medicine. The journal
of Heredity has not added anything to their license yet but has a
contact person now on their website and say that they actively support
it.

I've listed the licenses of these publishers on my webpage
http://text.soe.ucsc.edu/progress.html, in the third column of the
table.

cheers
Max

"Some journals cost as much as $40,000 per year"

Can't think of any earthly reason why a journal, essentially a collection of articles written describing research already paid for, would cost that much. High time this crap got written up in history books.

Interesting! I'm wondering... how many journals can your BC users
actually text mine?

Did you ever have a case where someone used text mining and wanted to
publish the results, i.e. the sentences from the text that contained
the information?

thanks

This is clearly a matter of great and immediate importance. A few of us met
yesterday at Oxford and discussed Heather's excellent blog posts. The
immediate outcome is that JennyM, DianeC and I will try to pull material
together.

My memory is that about 18 months ago we started to pull together something
under "Panton papers" and there may be some early drafts on OKF wikis.

It will not be easy to get a rapid and authoritative paper about
text-mining (I prefer to call it information-mining) - there are lots of
technical details and legal concerns. This is why it took 2 years to hack
out the details of the Panton Principles. Therefore I think we should aim
for a background (non-normative) summary of the current position and a set
of general principles which deliberately (at this stage) leave details to
be filled in.

Ideally we would like to come up with principles to which all parties
(authors, publishers, libraries) could put their names. We shall probably
be asking for more than some publishers currently allow in their
contractual restrictions - we would ask them to realise the many benefits
they will get from allowing mining.

Among the things which we probably should not address are:
* what can and cannot be mined and reproduced
* to what spread of activities (e.g. science) this belongs
* mechanisms for making it happen (including better technical provisions)

It is particularly important that we do not give away rights that we
already believe we have or which we can reasonably aspire to. This is not a
negotiation, it's a statement of principles.

We'll be doing this on this list and OKF wiki pages.

P.

To: "info at okfestival.org" <info at okfestival.org>



Hello,

This email is sent everyone who submitted a proposal on the first round of
Open Knowledge Festival Call for Proposals. Thank you very much for your
contribution!

In total we received 22 Topic Stream proposals and 49 Individual
Presentation proposals. In addition we registered approximately 15 ideas
that came from the brainstorming session in Helsinki on 10 April (
http://okfestival.okfnpad.**org/helsinki-meeting-10-april<http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/helsinki-meeting-10-april>
)**.

ONE IMPORTANT QUESTION - ANSWER LATEST ON THURSDAY 26 APRIL:

We would like to publish basic information about the proposals we received.
Please let us know if it is ok to publish:

A) Title, Keywords, Content + Format, Contact person name, People / Team
members
or
B) Please do not publish any information

If we don't hear from you we assume that the answer is *A*.

The OKFestival planning group will go through all the proposals during next
2 days (24 & 25 April) and will then submit a proposal of OKFestival
programme structure for the Advisory Board to comment. The decisions will
be published on 2nd of May.

Best regards,

Juha Huuskonen.

OKFestival coordinator / Helsinki

I spent an hour or so trying to come up with pithy or snappy
expressions, but only got this far:

We can and will process any documents we can read with any software we want.

(or: the right to read is the right to mine).

We can and will publish facts which we discover by reading and
processing documents.

(or: facts don't belong to anyone).

Hi all
Having a statement of principles which extends to text mining initiatives would be an extremely useful first step- however I would caution that if people don't know what they can or cannot mine at a practical/application level means they may end up being the 'emperor's new clothes'
We need "teeth" with these principles so need to address the licensing arrangements that allow for the implementation of the principles. To me they go hand in hand.

Completely agreed. The BBB declarations are wonderful. They give the
principles which cicumscribe the potential implementations. BBB simply
gives the abstract rights. Then we have to implement them and say that
CC-BY is compatible, CC-NC is not.

We need "teeth" with these principles so need to address the licensing

Teeth have been sadly lacking in the Open Access community. No-one seems to
care about adherence to the BBB principles. In our case Teeth will depend
on bottom-up concerns - if a publisher says they implement the textmining
principles and then doesn't comply they will be identified. Whether that
will make a change depends on funders, institutions, etc. - people, in
short.

We do now  http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/Science/TextMiningPrinciples
(currently
empty)

If people prefer to edit on a pad and then copy across to the wiki when
plans are more concrete, we have one of those too
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-textmining and I've copied across some
relevant content from this email thread.

I think a Skype/Etherpad chat with those interested in contributing would
be a great help at this stage.
Heather, you'd be key so could you let me know off-list a few times that
would be good for you and I'll set up a Doodlepoll.

Thanks very much, and let's keep the momentum going on this!

Jenny

I would plead strongly for the 'what can be reproduced' bit of this to be subject to a more open discussion. It's one of the most important issues.

Apols for the misunderstanding, my fault for using 'open' in a diff context - my request is that "what can and cannot be mined and reproduced" *should* be discussed and addressed - as it's the key issue. Am trying to get comments up on yr blog post but it's not behaving...

Thanks and understood. It is critical that is *is* discussed, and very
possibly on the OKF site.

The point here is to create a declaration about text-mining similar to
Budapest/Berlin/Bethesda [for Open Access]. They deliberately do not go
into details, but state a goal that can later be reified in law and
practice. They state what "Open Access" means in general terms. Phrases
like "for whatever purpose", "everybody", "without further permission".
They do NOT state that there should be a licence - licences are simply one
way of implementing them.

Let us call the Declaration of textmining the "Open Text Mining
Declaration". (It's slightly but not very contaminated by NPG's "Open
Text-mining Initiative" which most people have forgotten. It should be
brief - perhaps 2-3 lines at. It would define Open Text-mining...

"By Open textmining we mean ... everyone ... without further permission ...
available to all ...".

That does not mean that everyone must agree to do it. It is a goal. The BBB
declarations are not yet implemented universally. But they are the
yardstick that most of us use. They are particularly useful because so many
people and organisations create their own usage for "Open Access" without
defining it - thus causing confusion. We wish to avoid this for this new
field.

The details come second, and change as the world and technology changes. It
is generally agreed that CC-BY licences permit text- and other mining
without further permission. Contrast that with almost everything else where
nothing is clear.

If 20 scientists per university wish to text-mine that means 1000
universities * 20 scientists * 100 publishers == potentially 1 million
requests. The system can't cope. So the only ways forward are:
* refuse everything. There seem to be publishers who take this view. It has
the virtue of clarity
* permit everything. There are certainly publishers (BMC/PLoS) who take
this view
* leave everything unclear. "consult your librarian" "we'll discuss this
with our marketing people". That's the position for most publishers.

Fuzziness is destroying scientific progress and creating tensions. The OTMD
is an attempt to bring some clarity. Whether any given publisher accepts ,
rejects or ignores it is irrelevant to the wording of the declaration.

I strongly support the kind of open text-mining declaration Peter MR
describes.

Peter is exactly right in his understanding of the purpose of the BBB
statements in the OA domain. They defined OA and set out goals. Sometimes
they described in general terms some strategies for achieving those goals.
(For example, the Budapest statement described what we now call green and
gold OA as methods for delivering OA.)  But they left implementation
details to those inspired to reach the goals, didn't dictate just one path
to reach the goals, and tried not to say anything that might be made
obsolete by advances in technology.

I'm far from a specialist in text mining, but I'd be happy to help the
cause in any way that I could.

One question:  should the text-mining declaration cover data mining as
well? Or are the issues so different that they deserve separate treatment?

> I see them as complementary. "Data" has a degree of syntactic
accessibility - "text" does not. For example a CSV file with numbers in is
"data", while a narrative of a chemical reaction is "text". Supplemental
info is sometimes data (e.g. CIF files or Excel spreadsheets), sometimes
semi-structured text.

A key problem is the word "text". There must not be a distinction in how
the information is held. In is inappropriate to argue that
"two grams" "twenty degrees" is text and so a "create work" and
"2 g" "20 deg C" is factual data.

For that reason our declaration must cover:
* text
* diagrams (line drawings, graphs, spectra, networks, etc.)
* images ( mainly photographic)
* audio (e.g. animal recordings)
* video (e.g. behavioural studies)

All of these can be the primary means of reporting scientific fact, yet
"images" are treated as creative works and so often rented for large
amounts of money by commercial publishers. I can remember when one
publishers REDREW my scatterplots to avoid copyright as they had been
published elsewhere. This was factual data, produced by computer. Not
surprised they introduced significant distortion - and that was 30+ years
ago.
