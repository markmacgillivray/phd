Anyone interested in helping to maintain an up to date list of key
climate related datasets?

  http://ckan.net/group/climatedata

This is a collaboration between the Open Knowledge Foundation
(okfn.org), Clear Climate Code (clearclimatecode.org) and the
scientists at Real Climate (realclimate.org).

If you'd like to help out - please drop me a line off list!

Interesting! I have been looking for such a nice list.


I am wondering about the now famous CRU HadCRUT3 data set.
On this page http://ckan.net/package/uea-cru-hadcrut3 it says that the 
data is open. However, on the 'Met office' homepage
http://hadobs.metoffice.com/hadcrut3/terms_and_conditions.html
it says: "The material may be downloaded to file or printer for the 
purposes of private study and scientific research. Any other proposed use 
of the material is subject to a copyright licence available from the Met 
Office".

http://opendefinition.org/1.0 has "The license shall not restrict any 
party from selling or giving away the work either on its own or as part of 
a package made from works from many different sources."

I would say that the Met Office directly restricts redistribution as 
stated in The Open Knowledge Definition.

Maybe a more Open Knowledge compatible license is available from the CRU 
web site? However, due to the security breach they now have changed the 
web site so the CKAN links does not work.


all the best
Finn

Great - we very much hope that it will be a useful resource. We are
currently trying to make it more comprehensive by integrating other
similar lists! Also this will be a useful way to start to make
enquiries about whether datasets are open or not.

If anyone is interested in helping out - please let me know!

Indeed - I recall that before the UEA CRU website was taken down, it
distributed another copy of the data, which seemed to only require
attribution for others to reuse it. Thats what the ue-cru-hadcrut3
page is about:

  http://ckan.net/package/uea-cru-hadcrut3

The Met Office copy is at:

  http://ckan.net/package/uk-metoffice-hadcrut3

And, as you say the Met Office data does not seem to be open.

Fully agree!

Yes - you're right. I think we should leave this for now, rather than
point to Met Office copy, as it could be that the original UEA CRU
copy comes back, including the less restrictive license.

See, e.g., the page on the Wayback machine from May 2008:

  http://web.archive.org/web/20080523203513/http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/index.htm

Which states:

  The various datasets on the CRU website are provided for all to use,
provided the sources are acknowledged. Acknowledgement should
preferably be by citing one or more of the papers referenced on the
appropriate page. The website can also be acknowledged if deemed
necessary. CRU will endeavour to update the majority of the data pages
at timely intervals although this cannot be guaranteed by specific
dates.

Best wishes,

Jonathan
