 Hi All The latest NHS Hack Day is happening in Oxford 26-27 Jan 2013. If
you're a geek who loves the NHS and are interested in improving healthcare
through technology and knowledge sharing, please sign up at
http://nhshackday.com/.  If you or your organisation are interested in
supporting the event in a more involved way, please see the message below
and of course you are all encouraged to forward this invitation via your
social networks to anyone you feel might be interested!

Jenny

*What are NHS Hack Days? *
*
*
They're events that bring together healthcare and technology professionals
and other "geeks who love the NHS" to help to improve healthcare.

Here's a video from the most recent NHS Hack Day in Liverpool:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NnfMmKKvBk

*What were the outputs from the first two NHS Hack Days?*

   1. Fun and community, NHS Hack Day mailing list, twitter, and pub meets
   continue. Several teams that formed during the weekend have continued
   meeting and working on their projects. One team went on to make
   PrescribingAnalytics <http://prescribinganalytics.com/>, a web based
   analytics tool using open data to support better value prescribing in the
   NHS.
   2. Individual projects included OpenBNF.org <http://www.openbnf.org/>, a
   more accessible and useful version of the BNF (a book doctors use to look
   up the dose of medicine they prescibe),
ChecklistHQ.com<http://checklisthq.com/>,
   a website for making and sharing check lists (rather than relying on solely
   on your memory), and
Cellcount<http://frectal.com/2012/09/30/cell-counter-nhshackday-opensourceopenehr/>,
   a tool that helps haematology doctors count cells and saves them time.
   3. We got people talking about NHS Hack Days, open source, open
   governance, and the advantages of employing software developers. We were
   featured on BBC Radio
4<http://www.tactix4.com/World_at_One_-_28_05_2012_NHSHACKDAY.mp3>,
   in the British Medical
Journal<http://www.bmj.com/content/344/bmj.e3609?tab=citation>,
   and in the Guardian<http://www.guardian.co.uk/healthcare-network/2012/jun/06/nhs-hack-day-apps-patient-hell>.
   More coverage can be found here <http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/Media>.

*How we can help you*
*
*
We bring together a large number of very talented professional software
developers, designers, and user interface experts, academics and healthcare
professionals.

We can make rapid prototypes of technological solutions to problems you and
your organization face and provide feedback in a low cost and safe
environment.

We can help you to make sure that your organizations technology projects
are well conceived and good value, and that this is well communicated.

*How you can help us*
*
*
You can help us out in a few ways:

1. By sponsoring lunch, we'd like to provide a healthy lunch for all of

the attendees on both days, this will cost in the region of ?4000. The
event is run not for profit and we keep open accounts
http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/SponsorshipAndAccounts.

2. By sponsoring challenge prizes

3. By sponsoring a prize to support/facilitate further development of
very promising work

4. By helping with judging (Panel includes Ben Goldacre, Tom Steinberg,
and Richard Lehman are confirmed at present)

5. By providing media/communication support. Spreading the word about NHS
Hack Day
Oxford through your network/connections.

6. By working out how NHS Hack Day might be able to contribute to/support
any existing projects within your organization.

NHS Hackdays are run by Open Health Care UK (hello at openhealthcare.org.uk)

Can't be there, very sorry (will be abroad). Very interested in OpenBNF - I
was involved about 15 years ago in trying to see if BNF could be made Open
and semantic - that was ahead of its time. I'd be very interested in seeing
whether the chemical structures of the drugs could be added.

	Scientific Knowledge"
Message-ID: <CAD2k14NbZCot2PioDLdx7uLsstCzs0Gdts885-Xu1QBNe+LEGw@mail.gmail.com>

I (and a number of OKFers) am a fellow of the Open Forum Academy, a group
centered on open Standards and practice primarily in IT but also related
fields. One of their outputs is an Open book with contributed chapters. In
the first book Jenny Molloy , Diane Cabell and I wrote a chapter on Open
Content Mining see:
http://openforumacademy.org/library/ofa-fellows-reference-library

I have now volunteered another chapter on "Bottom-up creation of Open
Scientific Knowledge" and they are happy to publish this. Is anyone
interested in being a co-author? We would have an OKF affiliation as well
as our day jobs.

I proposed this on the basis that we have the means to create our own
knowledge (whether directly of indirectly). This could include things like:
* citizen science
* aggregation and indexing of current open scientific knowledge

I want to get across the idea that we now do not have to have science
sanctioned from the top down. Suggest you mail this list with ideas and
we'll find a skype time.

Dear Peter & other list members

I would be interested to be involved in such a project. As you may know I
see the problem of making knowledge widely available best solved by the
formation of knowledge communities centered on specific areas, for instance
groups that focus on specific organizing knowledge on specific diseases, by
managing databases with aggregated papers, publishing papers themselves,,
link to citizen science groups etc.
I would be happy to participate in writng a chapter on creation of open
scientific knowledge using this idea.

cheers TOM

Tom - that's fantastic. You bring exactly what the OFA is - I think -
looking for. One message is that you do not have to be an anointed person
to be a scientist.

Great. We'll need to skype at some time.

BTW this is a chapter which will be accepted (when we have written it) but
I doubt the journal is indexed by the commercial orgs. That doesn't worry
me.

Dear Peter et al.,

I'd like to contribute as well, the project sounds fabulous.

Brief intro as I'm quite new to this list: I'm currently finishing my PhD
in bioinformatics and have been active in free/open source software
communities for quite some time now. Among others, I'm also a science
blogger for the Nature-SciLogs.com 'Beyond the Lab' which explores new ways
of doing science (citizen science, DIYbio, etc.). My personal focus is on
'garage biology' and economic models in self-sustained communities such as
DIYbio informal groups. I recently joined the (thus far) infant OKFN France
where enthusiasm is also present to develop open science in the country.


Have a nice evening/day :)
Rayna

Great - I'm therefore assuming you are in the EU timezones.

I'm excited by the enthusiasm. We are going to have to be pragmatic in
terms of numbers -

* do we need to skype? I think so at the start
* can we coordinate all this?

I'm going to suggest we limit authorship to Europe (it is a Euro
group) and Sridhar
Gutam since we've agreed. Most of the other papers are single author ones -
and I'll call a halt at end of play today!

P.


Have a nice evening/day :)

Hi Peter,
I'm also interested in joining the writing. The propagation of citizen science by aggregating and indexing the current scientific knowledge and making raw data available is exactly what we're hoping to achieve with openSNP. The project now runs for about 1 1/2 years and we're seeing the first impact of how people are using the data made available. 

Cheers,
Bastian

Great!!

I suspect that we will move towards a chapter with a general intro and then
sections done by each contributor.

It may me a good idea for each contributor to think of a paragraph
describing what they want to say and we'll try to hack a framework that
glues it together.

We'll probably include things like:
* citizen science
* personal science (like SNPS)
* self-aggregating communities (such as Open Malaria)
* information-driven science
* citizen analysis of public science data.

etc.

That sounds like a good idea. I think it would be a good thing to do a Skype session to start things. This way we can get a better feeling for the other authors and see in which direction we want to go. Should we do a Doodle for a date & time?

Cheers,
Bastian

Seems like the best thing to do, indeed. Who will be proofreading at the
end, btw?

This makes a quite impressive amount of topics to address :) And as Bastian
jumped in with openSNP, I was also mulling over parts about privacy as we
end up pretty naturally with uploading our genome data on github or the
likes. I hope there will be a decent word count allowed ;)

Last but not least: what is the deadline for a rough cut of the whole?

As for the practicalities: a Doodle to schedule the kick-off confcall? As
all of us except Sidhar are in Europe timezones, we should perhaps try the
week-ends better?

Have a nice evening :)
Rayna

Dear all,

This is evolving really good :D I think that from our Citizen Cyberscience
Centre we will be also taking some time to collaborate on this. I'll double
check with my other colleagues and let you know.

Cheers,

Daniel

Wow!
We now need an OKFN Etherpad or wiki or Googledocs to collect or ideas.
Volunteer?

I've mailed Shane @ OFA to tell hime we are having a football team approach
and asking for page limits.

I think the best way will be to put our ideas down and then try to pick out
communalities.

Hi All

Etherpad set up here for ideas:
http://okfnpad.org/ofa-chapter

Google doc may be easier for drafting and commenting given the number of
authors (it's public):

Dear all, thanks again for all your input last year. As you might remember we've finalized a study on Open Science for the European Commission.
It turned out to have quite an impact and we're supposed to give a high-profile presentation in 2 weeks with top decision makers in EU.
Because of this policy impact, I could not yet share the results with you. Hope to do it soon.
 
Anyway, for this next presentation, I'm compiling a list of success stories of science 2.0. We look for inspiring scientific advances enabled by:
- open access
- open data
- open code / reproducible science
- other collaboration tools such as wiki, blogs, etc

It would be great if you could help finalizing this compilation. we could really make a small difference in EU policies on this topic.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq7ILf5BATiJdHBzZ3JDdjRaTGtmQUE0M3gtSHVfZ1E

By the way: why don't we build opensciencestories.org?

Best
david

The @ccess wg. at okfn has a page with open access success stories. (
Access.okfn.org) Also the site whoneedsaccess.org has personal stories. You
may find stories that are useful for you on these sites.
Cheers.

Fantastic. This is really exciting

Understood.  Anything you can feed back to the world will be really
valuable. Success stories of politicians believing in Open are fantastic.

I'd look at Fernando Perez' presentation to PyCon Canada 2012.
http://blog.fperez.org/2012/11/back-from-pycon-canada-2012.html
iPython, and especially iPython Notebook, is shaping up to be an
amazing tool for collaboration, sharing, publication, etc.  There are
a series of cool examples from about 40 minutes on in the video,
including two particularly ones from about 43:30.

Also ask Victoria Stodden for some RunMyCode stories.

Hi David,

A few highlights from last year in open science, in my opinion:

In the same spirit as Nick's comment, also take a look at the knitr
(similar spirit to the ipython notebook) project, http://yihui.name/knitr/,
which has had a big impact in making research conducted in R more
reproducible; particularly thanks to integration with the Rstudio project.

Certainly NSF's changing "papers" to "products" is a significant step for
Open Science as well, e.g. see the (paywalled) article from yesterday
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v493/n7431/full/493159a.html

In my opinion, the increased participation of journals in mandatory and
synchronized data archiving through data dryad is a continuing success
story from last year, e.g. see http://datadryad.org/pages/jdap

The rapid growth of sharing figures, data, presentations, code, and even
grants on Figshare.com might make a good candidate too.

The culture-shift of geneticists embracing preprint archives this year
certainly seems worth remarking on, particularly as biologists have been
one of the staunchest opposition formerly.   e.g. see Haldane's Seive, and
dx.doi.org/10.1038/488019a

(A more personal story of my own experience in practicing open science is
here:
http://www.carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html,
though nothing on the innovative community scale you're probably looking
for)


Cheers,

Carl

by
Heather Piwowar <http://researchremix.wordpress.com/author/researchremix/>

A Nature editor contacted me in November, asking if I'd like to write a
Comment about the upcoming NSF policy change in Biosketch instructions.  It
sounded like a great chance to talk about the value of alternative research
products with a wide audience, so I agreed.  The comment was published
yesterday and is now available here:

Piwowar H. (2013). Value all research products, Nature, 493 (7431) 159-159.
DOI: 10.1038/493159a <http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2F493159a>

Because of Nature's policies about copyright assignments for Comments, the
comment is not open access and it is behind a paywall.  Arg.  That said, I
requested that it be one of their "free" articles and they agreed, so it
will be freely available at the above link for a week or two.  I will post
the text up on my website as soon as I am able, 6 months from now.

Working on a blog post about the process behind the scenes, because it was
certainly unlike anything else I've published to date!

Dear All

Sincere apologies but I am now unable to host a Skype call next Tuesday,
therefore I propose moving the meeting to the next Tuesday 22 Jan.

I'm very sorry for the inconvenience but I hope many of you will still be
able to join us to discuss plans for the year and introduce yourselves and
projects, it's great to see so many people already signed up on the pad.

http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-15jan2013

If you can no longer make the date, please feel free to comment on the pad
or respond to the minutes I will circulate via the mailing list and blog
and I hope you can make the next meeting in March.

Best wishes

Jenny

David,

I've added our open science projects to the gdoc. The PZQ project we ran on
the Synaptic Leap is finished and achieved what we were tasked to do by the
World Health Organisation in Geneva. We did it because of input by
specialists we didn't know at the start, but who could contribute because
the project was open. This should be of interest to the EU! Happy to fill
in more if you need it.

Happy New Year everyone,

Mat

This is an outstanding document and says 80% of what I would have said.

Rather than repeat it I suggest we create a response from the
researchers/readers point of view stressing those not employed in UK
universities (i.e. mainly the scholarly poor). I think we can reasonably
argue that Open public scientific research is a massive public good and
that by opening our research we are contributing to the welfare and
prosperity of those outside Britain as well as in it. I suspect that this
will have particular appeal to the Lords. To that extent I think we could
reasonably  take the approach:
* OKF is a global movement (with UK origins)
* we have collected significant experience and anecdotal evidence through
our activities
* this is almost certainly a very small proportion of the actual desire for
scholarly information
* in this area Britain's actions are a major beacon for the rest of the
world.

Thank you for the heads up Peter and all-

As some of you may know, I have carried out extensive research
The first 'systematic enquiry' of its kind in this research field

showing that the UK is not always as cool as its propagandists like to
portray it :-)
in fact right the opposite, conservative, reactionary publishing
policies can hide behind
a false facade of openness

Disclaimer: I am an independent researcher and do not benefit
financially nor politically from the support of any organisation
including the OKFn :-)

Here some links I ll submit as evidence, FYI

Let me know if you have any questions

cheers

Good people,

I do not want to dampen the cheerleading efforts in this list to look
for success stories in open access
I think its good to collect success stories

But what about stories of persecution, and lack of support for open
access policies?

I'd be interested to collect stories of other people being persecuted
and their lives being made miserable for their effort
in making information and knowledge widely accessible....

http://tech.mit.edu/V132/N61/swartz.html

worth starting a collection perhaps? so that'  the  open access
movement' does not lose its sense
of perspective ....

I'd be very cautious about building lists like this. Take Assange, for
example: is he resisting persecution by a justice system used maliciously,
or is he using Wikileaks as cover to dodge rape charges in Sweden? Putting
him on a list of open access martyrs implies support for his position,
which I personally wouldn't be comfortable doing at present.

I am with Thomas. The news about Swartz is devastating, but no one knows why, and will probably never *really* know why. Conflating unrelated things may be just as bad as not connecting related ones.

Thomas

uh?

I agree that the ones I mentioned are different cases, possibly in a
very broad spectrum of open access to information issues  and each of
them would need to be qualified accordingly, with corresponding facts

However each of these cases has a common character imho: the system of
corruption wants to show
people a lesson, make those who dare challenge the system  'examples'
of what happens when you blow the whistle or dare cross the linek  to
scare other people off from telling the truth

i'd say if we do not keep count of how many people are marginalised
for doing REAL work in the front line
we are definitely not being scientific nor seeking truth about what is
happening in reality in relation to OA....

cheers

SIDENOTE I do not want to go into specifics here
however please note that there was no rape charge raised in the case
of Assange before the wikileaks case was made against him. this could
possibly mean that the entire international legal system can be
manipulated including friends family and former relations (including
people one may have slept with) turned against any person who becomes
unconfortable and an embarrassment to the sytem. Note that myself
would have a much more relaxed and comfy  lifestyle would I pay lip
service to the lobbies...

I can see where you're going with it, but I feel that making this sort of
'martyrs list' almost canonizes the people on it. That's a dangerous game
to play.

Also, not everyone agrees about what should be open - this list is about
openness in science, and of the three names you give, only Swartz was
handling scientific knowledge. That I support open access to scientific
research doesn't automatically imply that I support disclosure of political
information through Wikileaks.

Finally, we are usually careful to work within the law, trying to get it
changed where we think it is unjust. Civil disobedience has its place in
changing the law, but we may not all agree on what actions are justifiable.

That's a very big conclusion to draw from very little evidence. The
publicly available facts are simply insufficient to say whether the charges
against him in Sweden are genuine.

A friend of mine used to be a butcher.   He and a rancher would drive
out to the cows, and separate one off to be shot.  The other cows did
not seem very interested, they just kept chewing.  It is not us today.

I don't think you'd have to look too hard to see this reaction to a
wide variety of past state injustice or persecution.   I'd encourage
you to watch 'The most dangerous man in America' if you have not
already, but I am sure you can think of some events yourself.

Of course, the various state departments would much rather we discuss
and despair of the details of the Assange rape case than step back and
look in overview at the various weapons used against Wikileaks prior
to that.    Likewise, I am sure that those motivated to prosecute
Aaron Swartz would rather we express suitable sorrow at a 'troubled
young man' or some other such slander.

The problem with the implication that it always goes well, is that it
is so astonishing and then invisible to others, when it goes badly.
I think Paola is right - these things may take courage. If we give the
naive belief that we'll be treated fairly by opposing interests, it
weakens rather than strengthens the - sorry I will use this word -
cause.

Best,

Matthew

Yes but opennes in science is only one of the factors related to 'open
knowldge' at large

of course, and the opposite is also true, I mean that someone
interested in open access to scientific
research is also intersted in open access to full disclosure of facts
relating to the political civil
and military aspects of a country/world

I totally agree. To help to change the law, reducing the risks of
injecting systemic
weaknesses, helps to understand the maneuvers of information politics and the
system of power manipulation and control behind it


SIDENOTE

> That's a very big conclusion to draw from very little evidence.

DIsagree. It's a simple conclusion drawn from sufficient evidence :-)

check the dates of the wikileak scandal, the date of the alleged rape
claim was made, and the date of the alleged rape took place. (which
was about having intercourse without using shields btw) From the
evidence I found in various reports I can see no other possible
conclusion. That the legal system
is perfectly capable of ignoring evidence , is part of the problem
society is not worrying enough imho

 >The publicly available facts are simply insufficient to say whether
the charges against
> him in Sweden are genuine.

I agree, but that's a another issue that seems to support by sidenote argument

I don't want to stifle discussion - this is just to say that this out of
scope for what I intend to communicate to the House Of Lords. Note that my
initial suggestion do not suggest that I was complacent about the UK's
position - nor that the HoL was. I simply
noted that many people look to the UK for leads in the area of Open Access
- and indeed the HoLis doing this by asking for input. I shall continue my
discussions about what I shall write on the other thread.

I'm not comfortable holding Assange up as an example of someone persecuted
for their ideals, while it remains a serious possibility that he is hiding
from a trial about an unrelated matter in a democratic country. Wikileaks,
perhaps, but not Assange personally.

Slander? Accounts from his friends say that he had been suffering from
depression for years [1]. I agree that Swartz was probably unfairly treated
after the JSTOR episode, but we shouldn't assume that his suicide was a
direct consequence of that. And it feels highly inappropriate, a day later,
to be making it some kind of case study for the persecution of open access
supporters.

Whose cause? A core feature of the open 'movements' is that we're not a
unified force fighting for a single cause. We have many different
viewpoints, and we work together where our aims coincide. Again, this is
the open science list: Swartz is relevant to open science, but Wikileaks,
Assange & Manning are decidedly not.

Your use of the word 'cause' is interesting and unsettling. I fear that
when you're driven by a cause, it's all too easy to lose sight of
individuals. For now, at least, let Aaron Swartz's death be an individual
tragedy, not a loss to some higher cause. Likewise, let's not discount
serious possible wrongdoings by Assange as an individual, just because he
appears to share your cause.

(Peter, thanks for the last note- the discussion about the 'open
access martyrs' and the hypocrisy of our system, is not intended to be
directly related to the HoL, its another discussio altogether, but
below a more pertinent post  )

OK, here's something I think needs to be brought to the attention of the HoLs
since I am not sure these people are informed about the facts (which I
ll do my best to address)

I am curious to understand more about the JISC policy on reusing research data

How much public money has gone into funding JISC research so far?
(anyone has a figure?)

Where are the datasets?

When I  tried to access and reuse JISC data as part of my research
reference in a previous post,
I was told that I could not because it was destroyed. (see copy of
email exchange with Alma Swan,20011)
Subsequent exchanges with JISC director and other staff were
inconclusive (ie, their scant but polite answers evaded the questions
such as 'how come does  JISC not have a open data policy').


thoughts? comments? is this  useful evidence in relation to the consulation

cheers

Alma
thanks for reply
I am facing similar methodological challenges

it's a pity that the records were not kept in anonymous form, so that
they could be further analysed and the data manipulated .queried
differently

Isnt there a  legal requirement that research data record are kept for
a number of years?

it would also be interesting to be able to verify/cross validate your
findings, but without the original data, this will be impossible

I will then use your summary/conclusion as a reference

I must say that my own findings (enclose an overview of my research to
date) confirm your conclusions, however I have so far performed
limited field work, and was hoping to be able to re-use your data
(anonymous would also be Okay) to spare myself further data collection

I have looked at  openaccess map and the tracking project you have,
and would like to suggest that there may be a synergy with my work,
whereby I track/map open access in relation to the policy of the
funding body

wonder how can I meshup your data with my data, to produce further
insights into the landscape?
(currently looking at UK only to keep the scope manageable)

Finally, since you are obviously an expert, i wonder if you would
consider being interviewed  ( for an hour or so, over the phone, or
skype) to acquire further qualitative information in support of my own
research, outline in the enclosed paper, in the affirmative, i will
send you an outline of the interview questions/topics in advance of
the call

Thank you

I feel you have just repeated what I was complaining about: you do not
want to comment on the whole of what happened to Assange because you
don't want to get into discussion of a rape case and you don't want to
discuss the whole of what happened to Swartz because he was depressed.

Well, I know how it goes, but it's hard not to comment.

I was fully aware of the reaction that 'cause' generates, that's why I
wrote it as I did.

I don't believe I'm discounting serious wrongdoings by Assange. I
realize that some people do discount the faults of people who agree
with them.  It also very often happens that - to quote Aaron Swartz -
"It?s always easier for people to blame the victim". [1].  This is
what is called the "just-world hypothesis" [2], and it is very ugly
when you see it working.

There are some of us who work for 'open-*' believing that we can avoid
all political or moral concerns and concentrate only on the practical,
believing perhaps that any mention of other concerns is unattractive,
confusing or irrelevant.   I guess that works fine until you run into
trouble, and I guess that's why we are disagreeing...

Best,

Matthew

Many people may well be interested in both, but they are separate ideals.
This is not a black and white matter - it's perfectly possible to be in
favour of open access without thinking that all knowledge everywhere must
be public.

For example, my take on the information released by Bradley Mannings is
that much (but not all) of it should have been public in the first place,
but I'm not sure Mannings was justified in breaking the laws of his country
to release it, but I don't think that the response to it was morally
justified. Evidently your assessment of it differs, but I'm not interested
in starting a debate on that. My point is that I'm here for open science,
not open everything.

To be clear, what I described as a big conclusion was your suggestion that
the justice systems of multiple countries can be manipulated to serve
specific interests. That is certainly not a simple conclusion, and the
evidence presented is nowhere near sufficient to justify it. There is a
massive leap from 'I don't know why these rape claims weren't made before
the Wikileaks scandal' to 'the only possible explanation is powerful
sinister forces seeking retribution'. I've read conspiracy theories about
the moon landings and about 9/11 that had more evidence than that.

Thank you Thomas

I think part of this thread, however sensitive, are important to open science

Let me just pick on a couple of points


> Many people may well be interested in both, but they are separate ideals.

nooooo, they are not separate. you may see them as separate, and i
respect your view
but that's just the way you are looking at them (or the particular
lens you are using) that makes them separate

> This is not a black and white matter - it's perfectly possible to be in
> favour of open access without thinking that all knowledge everywhere must be
> public.

sure, and the contrary is also true (that it is perfectly possible to
be in favour of open access
AND thinking that knowledge related to public life of a country should
be disclosed to the public)

This is a very important issue, at the heart of a lot of discussions
about ethics.

Let me give an analogous example in relation to disaster management .
To save the life of the guy which has fallen in the undeground
railways, the experienced
war veteran had to break the law that says 'do not cross the railways'
In breaking the law, this man saves a life

Bradley may have broken the law, for a much bigger, higher and important
goal: opening the eyes of the american people and of the world as to
the system that governs them.

You want to judge Bradley?  I dont know any law , written by humans, capable of
judging such an act of courage.


> My point is that I'm here for open science, not open

my point is: science CONCERNS everything, nothing excluded, although I accept
scientists like to partition reality in different ways suitable to them

Here's is a timeline that to me shows clearly how the corrupt justice
system in Sweden and the UK are colluding to ruin a whistleblower
using arbitrary arguments, without having to be just nor justified. I
do not have a problem if you interpret the facts in this timelinein
another way.

I'm happy to have discussions or comment on either of those things, but I
want to avoid simply portraying them as some kind of martyrs, paying the
price for what they believe. Assange might be using his fame from Wikileaks
to avoid facing real charges, which would make him a poor example to hold
up.

Swartz did suffer as a result of his actions for openness, but it would be
wrong to imply that his suicide was a direct result of that. My
understanding is that suicide rarely has a single cause.

I don't believe you are discounting that, but I think that putting him in
this martyrs gallery would be to discount it.

Thomas

following my post

here is the link to an example of sometimes it is necessary to break
the law, if the cause
justifies it http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/nyregion/03life.html?_r=0

According to the law, Mr Autrey should have been fined for jumping
into the railway but , on this occasion, the transport authorities
seemed to be intelligent about interpreting the law.

But - this is the same thing.  If you object or protest in the face of
- say - a government or a corporation with political influence - it
may happen that they will come after you with all the tools at their
disposal.  Or it may not happen.  But if it does happen, it is our job
to observe, to comment, to object, and not to let the matter slide
into the comforting void of 'he was depressed' or 'he may have raped
someone'.  Well - that is what I - believe.  I hope you agree.

Best,

Matthew

So, you assert I'm objectively wrong that they're separate, but acknowledge
that someone who supports one may or may not support the other?

I maintain that openness in scientific research and in political/military
matters are distinct issues, and it is your 'lens' that conflates them.

There are certainly cases where breaking the law is philosophically
justified. But that fact doesn't automatically justify any specific case.

And yet, by calling it an act of courage, you are judging him. You judge
him very favourably, as I expected you would. I brought this up to
illustrate that a proponent of open science does not share all your views
about openness.

The commonly accepted definition of science does not include the
information Mannings and Assange released. Let's not start redefining the
word science.

That's your interpretation of the facts, not what the facts themselves say.
If you want to believe in a shadowy conspiracy, I'm sure it looks like
that. But the facts don't clearly show anything of the sort.

Well said. 

I believe, assertions are politics; assertions backed with evidence are science. The problem with politics is that folks have different views and no one wants to go home agreeing with the other side. Science, on the other hand, we all can agree upon until shown otherwise. Lather, rinse, repeat.

Everyone is welcome to their views, but it would probably be more productive if, on this list, we concentrate collectively on matters of open *science* as it is much easier to parse out than other matters.

Thomas

glad that some interesting core points are crystalizing in this
otherwise difficult discussion

. In any case thanks for the oppOrtunity to bring to the light how
unscientific can science become when
left to  reductionsm alone. telegraphic replies inline P

every choice of lens comes with built in distortions -
 bias is inevitable, but generally adopting a choice of methods
(lenses), the bias can be reduced

I tend to view favourably anyone who brings me truth, even if I do not
like them personally, and I definitely do not view as favourable
anyone who hides the truth, or justifies the hiding of the truth
but this should not be a personal discussion here I don't think-

> The commonly accepted definition of science does not include the information
> Mannings and Assange released.

It would be happy to believe that we can avoid the messy world of
politics and confine ourselves to the clean pure world of science.  I
guess we all know that temptation, otherwise we would be less likely
be scientists or programmers or both.

I know that some people believe that science can be more or less
completely separated from politics, prejudice and morality, but I
really don't understand how a practicing and observant scientist could
believe that.

The substantial part and relevant part of the discussion is whether it
is possible for someone to be harmed as a direct result of advocacy
for open data generally and open science in particular.

If so, that's an important fact worthy of recording, and that's the
point that I think Paola was making.

Of course, ruling any discussion of politics out of scope will mean we
can't have that discussion, because the harm arises from political
action.

Best,

Matthew

Hi All

Just a reminder that as there has been a lot of traffic on the open-science
list lately, you can subscribe using a digest option so you only receive
one email per day (possibly more on a very busy day).
Simply go to http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-science and under
the open-science Subscribers section at the bottom of the page you can
enter your email address and password (which you would have chosen or been
automatically allocated when you subscribed) to edit your subscription
options. If you've forgotten your password you can click for a reminder or
alternatively you could unsubscribe and resubscribe using the digest option.

Best wishes

Science clearly affects and is affected by events outside of science, but
that doesn't make everything under the sun relevant to discussion of
science, or more specifically of openness within science. As far as I have
seen, the information released by Mannings & Wikileaks did not particularly
relate to science. And the openness they were practising is something quite
different from open research.

Of course, that shouldn't prevent you discussing such matters. But the
primary focus of this list is open science, and we shouldn't try to
handwave Wikileaks into that heading.

Excellent idea! I will start the ball rolling for the working group to
register the domain and would encourage everyone to continue sending in
their own stories for David's presentation, we can hopefully get longer
write ups of these to post. Paolo's point about not focusing only on
success stories is valid, although I'm not sure this site would be
appropriate for the stories raised in that thread, it would certainly be
interesting to hear about where open science projects have encountered
problems and lessons have been learnt. I have at least two stories in mind,
one based on a talk by Anna Croft at OKCon 2011 about difficulties
encountered trying to integrate open approaches into the university
curriculum and get undergrads working openly on their projects and another
about the Malaria Atlas Project where data licensing became an issue
leading to a long slog contacting hundreds of data providers for a second
time in order to release the datasets openly (talk by Catherine Moyes,
Dryad UK Workshop 2011).

Interesting point, but a more central point worth making for me, perhaps is:

do we do enough to prepare, support and protect the people who take
risks to challenge the establishment  (and the hypocrisy upon which
the establishment supports its public face) knowing full well the
system will be closing in on them and will squash them through
arbitrary, unjust use of the justice system?

There more than on obvious correlation between aaron, assange and
bradley (all of them retrieved and /or published information and the
law was used arbitrarily and without adequate intelligent
interpreation to punish them , but also avaaz etc).  Therefore their
inclusion in the context of such a discussion is pertinent enough,
unless you have other reasons for wanting to censor discourse from
some of its vital components.

All, thanks for the *great* input, both on the email list and on the gDoc.
Some clarifications:
- we don't focus on open access as it's already well known, we're more interested on open data / code / notebooks / workflows etc
- the current approach for the presentation is to have 3 stories of discoveries done thanks to open science (incl. Human Genome Project); and 3 major scientific errors due to lack of openness.
- then I give some data points about uptake; and 
- elaborate on the barriers: career mechanisms centered on publishing, and IPR 

Finally, I personally don't have the time to work on open science stories myself though. But will contribute content to it. 
best
david

I have at least two stories in mind, one based on a talk by Anna Croft at OKCon 2011 about difficulties encountered trying to integrate open approaches into the university curriculum and get undergrads working openly on their projects and another about the Malaria Atlas Project where data licensing became an issue leading to a long slog contacting hundreds of data providers for a second time in order to release the datasets openly (talk by Catherine Moyes, Dryad UK Workshop 2011).

Hi All

Thanks for this discussion, great to see some strong debate! There are
definitely points that we won't resolve or agree on here and I think the
discussion about Aaron Swartz is of wider open knowledge interest, so it
may be of benefit to move the discussion to a more general forum than the
open science list.

Jonathan Gray has published a post about Aaron Swartz on the main OKFN blog
and I'm sure any comments you wish to leave there would be welcomed
http://blog.okfn.org/2013/01/14/goodbye-aaron-swartz-and-long-live-your-legacy/
.

Also, Khadija Britton, an organiser of the Open Science Summit, is
preparing a blog post on Aaron Swartz and open access/science which you may
wish to contact her about with your comments
https://twitter.com/KMBTweets/status/290855030993608704, I'll post the link
to this when published for anyone who wants to engage with others thinking
about the same topic.

Jenny

Given the mining bit (from the PDF)

*(iv) Text and data mining for scientific research purposes*
This work strand should
? Identify the scale and nature of demand for TDM access in the EU for
scientific research purposes, and appropriate means of meeting this demand.
? Explore the potential and possible limits of standard licensing models.
? Assess the appropriateness and feasibility of technology platforms to
facilitate TDM
access.
? Deliver solutions, including the possibility to develop effective
platforms to facilitate
TDM access.


If I could get my Panton Fellowship travel allowance to cover this, I would
go. Seems appropriate / relevant to the work I've been doing.

Best,

Ross

Great news! There are no formal page limits. If you sail past 8 pages it
might be time to consider slowing down, and after 12 pages it's almost
certainly time to take a break, but that said... whatever is needed to get
the job done.

Hi all,

Happy new to you all!

Yes, this is indeed an exciting and would like to volunteer. I would
like to know the deadlines and how I would have to contribute for
chapter or a micro chapter.

Is it still possible to have a micro chapter on how much open science
adds value/monetary or impact and contribution to scientific research
and humanity with a test case?

I would highly appreciate any feed back.

Looking forward to hear from you all.

Best wishes,

Judit

I'd like a skype between authors fairly soon. Jenny, can you coordinate

Hi All

They wanted a reply now so I've nominated Ross and we can change later if
necessary.

Apologies for not sending a reminder about the 11th Jan deadline, the
original communication said that we would be contacted again in the New
Year so I'm afraid I put it to back of my mind!

Obviously, Ross will be representing our views and feeding back from the
working group so I look forward to further discussion on the list.

Jenny

dear all,


this was new to me: the scholarly kitchen reports that an "US policy on 
making federal data public is circulating on Capitol Hill" and that it 
would include STM data, unlike the sk-author I would welcome such an 
initiative.

Dear all,

We would like to invite you to the Open Research Data Handbook sprint on
15-16 February in London, organised by the OKF Open Science Working Group,
the Open Data Research Network and the OKF Open Economics Working Group.
The event will be hosted by the Open Data Institute:

http://openeconomics.net/2013/01/17/open-research-data-handbook-sprint/

The Open Research Data Handbook aims to provide an introduction to the
processes, tools and other areas that researchers need to consider to make
their research data openly available.
To register to participate, please visit the Eventbrite page:

http://openresearchdata.eventbrite.com/

We look forward to your participation!

Dear Rayna,

We are planning to prepare in the week leading to the sprint through online
contributions and review, we have to check how it would work on the day,
but we would like to make sure that everybody who will not be able to
attend in person but would like to be part of this will be able to give
input.

Best wishes

Velichka

Dear OKFN lists,


Jevin West has kindly made available the list of 985 journals and their
publishers that he uses in his excellent OA plot here:
http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/index.php


I would like to build on this data to assess the licence used by each one
of those 985 journals to publish their articles.
I have started the task on a collaborative, editable Google Spreadsheet
here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdExBQm9UclBSaWxlMWVNelVDMHFnSkE


If you have some spare time, or are interested in helping out please help
us fill-in the data on spreadsheet, on the second sheet called 'Data'.

It's pretty simple to help out. Just Google the journal name given in
column A, and try and find out what licence it publishes its Open Access
articles under e.g. the Creative Commons Attribution Licence (CC BY)

Then fill-in the relevant details you find on the spreadsheet, in columns C
& D and (optionally) your name too in column F (added by)
All data filled-in on the datasheet will be public data for anyone to
use/copy/remix CC0 http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/

I have already scored 531 of the journals, so there's 454 left still to
score - I need your help to get this task done!
Many hands make light work...


Best,

Ross

I strongly endorse Ross's call for help. It's not much effort and highly
valuable and will further emhasize the value of Panton Fellowships in OKF

Hi Peter and Ross,

What about creating an app in Crowdcrafting for this problem? Will you be
interested? It could be really engaging for big media like slashdot.org or
similar web sites, so if we create an app that can help to do that, we may
send a notice to Reddit.com or Slashdot.org and get all the work done
really quickly.

What do you think? This idea is only valuable if you don't have a really
tight dead-line.

Cheers,

Daniel

There will, however, be MANY applications of crowdcrafting in schol pub.
One thing that would be really valuable is microtasks whcih could be
launched when people read/access a publication or publisher. Let's say you
have volunteered to help with this. Later you read a paper from a journal
not already processed.The system alerts you "would you like to annotate
this paper?" and then you do it. Or, "would you like to put this
publisher/paper into the task list?"

Following on from Ross' email about helping find license details for
journals, please find below a new way to discover small volunteering tasks
for OKFN projects to which would be fantastic if any of you - our open
science community - could contribute.

Of particular interest to members of this list might be:
- Help reviewing a School of Data course
- Contribute code to Crowdcrafting (a platform for citizen science and
other projects involving crowd sourced tasks e.g. image classification)

In addition, there are several working group specific tasks which are
always looking for contributors:
- Translate the Panton Principles into another language (
http://pantonprinciples.org/translations/)
- Contribute a guest post to the open science blog (
http://science.okfn.org/blog/)
- Contribute to the open research data handbook (
http://www.booki.cc/open-research-data-handbook/)

Thanks very much for your continued efforts and happy volunteering :)

Jenny

Subject: [okfn-discuss] Introducing the new OKFN Task Force
To: Open Knowledge Foundation discussion list <okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org>


Dear all,

First of all, I wanted to thank you all for all you have done in 2012. It
was truly amazing to see how the community has developed. The OKFN now has
more local groups than ever, we have started several new projects, had tons
of nice discussions and lots of cool tools were created. This really was
not possible without you, the people, so a big thank you!

Work being done by volunteers has always been core to what we do at the
OKFN. We would never have gotten here without all of your help! However, it
has not always been easy to find out where a lot of hands can generate
great success. A mailman discussion list such as this is great, but not
ideal for creating a backlog with the various amounts of things where you
can help with.

Also, there has been some confusion between 'community' and 'volunteers'.
The community is basically all of you active on mailing lists, in working
groups and local chapters.

Volunteers is a much smaller, but indispensable amazing group of people who
dedicate a small part of their time helping with things like translating
documents, hacking on tools, adding data to OpenSpending and helping create
School Of Data courses.

To solve both issues I have started gathering all projects that could use
some help and added them to a Google Group. Here you can find everything in
a comprehensive way and respond immediately if you see something that
interests you. You can find the group here:

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/okfn-task-force

Please become* a member* to stay updated about everything going on. A short
summary of what is listed now

- Help reviewing a School of Data course
- Help improving the Open Definition (in lots of different ways!)
- Contribute code to Crowdcrafting
- Open Data Handbook Builder
- Contribute or explore data in OpenSpending
- Complete and refine the failed banks data for visualisation

Looking very much forward to your contributions! If you have any questions
at the moment, feel free to ask.

Thanks again for your great effort, and looking forward to seeing what will
happen in 2013!

All the best,

That sounds feasible and possible :D As usual, if you need help (or anyone
on the list) for creating a PyBossa app, let me know it. I'll be happy to
help you!

Richard Van Noorden, 17 January 2013

Mathematicians plan to launch a series of free open-access journals
that will host their peer-reviewed articles on the preprint server
arXiv. The project was publicly revealed yesterday in a blog post by
Tim Gowers, a Fields Medal winner and mathematician at the University
of Cambridge, UK.

The initiative, called the Episciences Project, hopes to show that
researchers can organize the peer review and publication of their work
at minimal cost, without involving commercial publishers.

Hi, Edgar.

Thanks for sharing (actually it was him who pointed it out for me
previously, but the older is faster :P).

A professor just send me this discussion in another mailing list

http://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/why-ive-also-joined-the-good-guys/

I don't have time to read it now, but looking quickly, it seems interesting.

I think It's very interesting. I've been wondering why the cost of
publishing in open access journals is so high - often over ?1000, even for
online-only journals. They're aiming to reduce the costs dramatically, to
the point where they're talking about getting funding directly for the
system, and making publication free.

It's also struck me that we don't really need papers to be uniformly
formatted, and citations in strictly controlled formats. We just need a
legible document, and citations that we can quickly look up.

Exactly.

Given I just submitted something lengthy yesterday to the House of Lords
inquiry, I'm alarmed that the "witness guidance" PDF for this new BIS call
for evidence states:


"Respondees are requested not to submit copies of responses to other
consultations or to the Finch Report"

I feel slightly cheated having submitted some of my 'best' to the House of
Lords inquiry. I have half a mind to make this point in my BIS submission.
 I think I will now have to re-word, re-arrange and re-focus.

Above all we must not be put off from airing our legitimate views and
evidence.

Hi,

One of the benefits of using PyBossa is that it handles all those features
by default :-)

Hi Everyone,

Just wanted to let you know we?re organizing a meetup in London for Open
Data Day 2013 (23rd February):

http://www.eventbrite.com/event/5276951504

Open Data Day is a gathering of citizens in cities around the world to
write applications, liberate data, create visualizations and publish
analyses using open public data to show support for and encourage the
adoption of open data policies by the world's local, regional and national
governments.

The event is open to all, curious citizens, journalists, tech-geeks,
students, scientists, graphic designers. Swing by on the day to hack, have
a hangout and wrangle!

Beatrice, Ross & Rufus

Thanks, Ross!

I was discussing these days with a chemistry friend and he asked me
such list. I was going to e-mail here, thus I am glad it is already in
this stage!

When he asked me, I found this

http://www.doaj.org/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-access_journals

A table with the type of license would be really worth doing.

Out of interest does anyone know why we are having all of these
renewed consultations and inquiries?

I know there has been quite a lot of behind the scenes lobbying against the
Finch proposals from publishers, learned societies and others.

I wonder if these consultations and inquiries are related to these
complaints and criticisms? If so I wonder whether it would be worth very
publicly restating the case for Finch?

Yes - I think it would. Without too much effort I think we can say that
Finch set out a valuable trajectory for Open scientific research and
publication and we hope that BIS would adopt it and the RCUK implementation
with little change.

Otherwise we are going to suffer death by exhaustion.

Does anyone also have something like this related to funding councils and their preferred deposition models.

Happyb to do this. But no point in reinventing the wheel

Some structure in documents is quite useful when viewed through the
lens of harvesting the text documents into other structured
representations such as ontologies, issue maps, topic maps.

I would argue (and I will) that publisher typesetting and formatting
destroys information and accessibility. It has no point and adds (probably)
50-100+ USD per paper in direct charges. There are many other costs - do we
need a publisher sales force to tell me what to read? Do we need lawyers to
stop us reading papers? Or paywall managers...

Undoubtedly. But I'm sure there are more efficient ways to achieve that
than paying a bunch of humans to go through every document manually
applying precise formatting criteria.

Maybe there's an opportunity for better writing software, that maintains
more of the semantics of the document. In my field (biology), papers are
still mostly written in MS Word (or Libreoffice, for the few Linux users).
Latex would be a better starting point, but it needs to be something that
looks like it will make life easier, not something that looks like a
technical chore. I've tried LyX, which is along the right lines, but it's
not quite fluid enough.

Completely agreed. But since every publisher uses different approaches they
destroy structure (e.g. they all do references differently - this destroys
value). By contrast PubMed adds consistent and publisher-independent
structure

Semantic structure is very important, esp. for automated discovery and content mining, although good typography and formatting make for a pleasant reading experience for humans as well. In my view, PLOS does this very well (in fact, PLOS seems to do just about everything very well).

Thanks Cameron. No worries about the condition of the code. Maybe those of us who use it can leave behind some documentation about what we did. That's my goal.

Out of interest does anyone know why we are having all of these renewed consultations and inquiries?

I know there has been quite a lot of behind the scenes lobbying against the Finch proposals from publishers, learned societies and others.

I wonder if these consultations and inquiries are related to these complaints and criticisms? If so I wonder whether it would be worth very publicly restating the case for Finch?

Yes - I think it would. Without too much effort I think we can say that Finch set out a valuable trajectory for Open scientific research and publication and we hope that BIS would adopt it and the RCUK implementation with little change.

Otherwise we are going to suffer death by exhaustion.

Exactly.

Given I just submitted something lengthy yesterday to the House of Lords inquiry, I'm alarmed that the "witness guidance" PDF for this new BIS call for evidence states:


"Respondees are requested not to submit copies of responses to other consultations or to the Finch Report"

I feel slightly cheated having submitted some of my 'best' to the House of Lords inquiry. I have half a mind to make this point in my BIS submission.  I think I will now have to re-word, re-arrange and re-focus.

Above all we must not be put off from airing our legitimate views and evidence.

Yes. PMC adds it through NLMDTD. Publishers do not add it. It's actually
quite
 easy to add - I am developing software to restructure and restructure
scholarly pubs - except I shall be sued if I actually use it.

You love reading reference lists where you cannot tell the journal number
from the year from the page. Reading double column  format on a landscape
PC?? Where archaic fonts turn mathematic symbols into gobbledgook?

heh, heh, obviously not as the above doesn't sound like either good typography or formatting.

As far as I can tell, Cameron's repository doesn't actually include
the DOAJ parser.  It doesn't work from the command line and a grep of
the sources doesn't reveal a parsedoaj method hidden anywhere.

Rather the mess with fixing it, it might be better to redo it on
ScraperWiki so that the results are always up-to-date and accessible.

Tom, ScraperWiki looks like a practical way to go. (I have not had the time to try out Cameron's code). I burdened right now with start of semester work. But I'd like to see what it will take to get something of use going.

Message-ID: <CAJYmwod5SSN5=+tVALM3S6=k=953oJf5wcWf9ZLAyk6FWeGcTg@mail.gmail.com>

 Dear all,

I am a 'fresh' doctoral researcher at the Humboldt Institute for Internet
and Society since Septemer 2012. The topic of my research is open science;
respectively open research & participation.

Since I am dealing with open science in my phd, I thought, I should also
practice what I preach. So I wrote a blog entry about my understanding of
open science and how I want to explore it. In the entry I included a link
that leads to a Google Doc with a first scratch of my research design.

Since open science is a topic that is near and dear to all of you and since
you have surely more experience than me with the issue in both, theory and
practice, I venture the step and post the link  to the blog article in this
mailing list:
http://www.hiig.de/en/open-science-in-academic-research-open-draft-2/

For those of you that have a few free minutes and any interest in what I
wrote and am planning to do, I invite you to skim through the article and
the linked scratch paper of my research design. Neither my conceptual frame
nor my methodological approach is cut in stone yet.

I really appreciate your feedback, reading suggestions, criticism or
praise, inspiration, ideas etc. ? ideally as a comment in the document or
in an Email to me.
Please accept my apologies if this Email is not of any relevance for you.

Thank you very much in advance!

& best regards from Berlin,

Benedikt

*In the study, I understand open science as the opening of the research
process and knowledge dissemination; as an emerging way to produce
knowledge. I acknowledge that open science as a movement embraces more than
that ...

I've read your blog and offer brief comments.
* it's useful to carry out the sort of analysis you are undertaking
* you are right that there is no simple or universal view. However talking
of an "impossible dream" and arguing against it is too simplistic and will
alienate many. You should be as dispassionate as possible and analyse the
current positions.

Good. You will need to create clear acceptable methodology.

In the first instance a collection of resources potentially labelled as
"open science" will be very valuable for the community.

Hey everyone,

Today I've made an important personal announcement: I've decided to
only publish in open-access academic publications. Even after years of
being in this group, it was still difficult to come to this decision,
but I'm glad I've finally reached it. You can, and I encourage you to,
read more about my thoughts here -- http://alexleavitt.com/oa/ -- and
if you feel inclined, please share it with colleagues and your
respective networks.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [open-science] Is Open Access still relevant? | invitation to a
	discussion
Message-ID: <CAOCrZ=RinkW3LP=QLNB9WQCSxi5c4-i3rnMyLcP8McyJJzz6Cw@mail.gmail.com>

Is Open Access still relevant?

The last years have been both satisfying and challenging for the Open
Access community worldwide. On one hand, we have experienced numerous
'victories' of the OA agenda, such as the OA policy of Research Council UK,
the Finch Committee report, and the OA policy of World Bank. Various
agreeable arguments have been made forcefully to highlight the need for a
transition to OA models of publication -- from betterment of academic
practices, to economic growth to human development. On the other hand, the
OA agenda seems like only one, and not a major one at that, 'openness'
movement among a crowd of similarly prefixed movements. Further, the OA
agenda increasingly appears to be a rather limited, rigid, and old one.
Many other 'openness' movements such as Open Data and Open Educational
Resources, one may argue, are more effectively designed to better academic
practices, drive economic growth and influence human development.

In a powerful critique of the existing OA agenda, Peter Murray-Rust asks:
'Is "Open Access" the same sort of beast [as the modern ideology and
practice of "Open"]?' <http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/26/is-open-access-open/>.
He goes on to list out the features of this 'modern ideology and practice
of "Open"': meritocracy, universality of participation, a willingness to
listen, openness of process, openness of results, and a mechanism to change
current practices (please see his blog post for clarification of these
features). Instead of having 'open' self-reflections about the changing
context and the need for revised strategies, as Eve Gray explains, the OA
agenda has often remained haunted by the Budapest Open Access Initiative
past and failed to interact with emerging allies such as OA scholarly
publications and grey literatures.

To ask the looming question bluntly, is there a need to envision a new,
more contemporary if nothing else, version of the OA agenda?

In the face of increasing acceptance of OA for journal-based research
publications by national and super-national bodies, what are the next
frontiers of the OA agenda? Does the journal-centric strategy of the
existing OA agenda needs revisiting? The last question is especially
pertinent in the context of developing countries, where policy-making is
often influenced by privately-funded research. Access to such documents
(and their underlying datasets) are significant in such cases for ensuring
government accountability, or simply to induce a broad, informed discussion
regarding making of national policies. At the same time, the diversity of
national policy frameworks across the world poses a critical challenge to
any global movement that aims to address global concerns while engaging
with local specificities and demands. Similarly for OA agenda, it is
crucial to discuss the possibility of a more participatory, flexible and
open process of setting strategic agendas at national and regional scales.
In this context, it might be useful to revisit the BOAI definition of OA,
and question whether this definition is sufficient for a global OA agenda,
and also whether the existing OA models (such as Gold and Green OA) are
sufficient for delivering the promise of that definition.

To return to the context of various 'openness' movements unfolding
worldwide, one may ask, if the OA agenda is now best pursued by dissolving
it within other 'openness' movements? Should we talk more of an alliance
between various 'openness' movements, or an expansion of some to
incorporate the others?

Dear all,

We have published sessions summary, slides and audio from the First Open
Economics Workshop, which took place in Cambridge, UK last December
gathering 40 academic economists, data publishers and funders of economics
research, researchers and practitioners: *

Message-ID: <CAD_CWO0mo10__RTfYGpn6St62YDPCwFTBRr9CnB7bTR9UH_fbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am hoping someone might be able to point me to resources related to the
understanding and management of privacy in the context of an open science
agenda.  Articles such as this recent one in the NYT

http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/health/search-of-dna-sequences-reveals-full-identities.html

highlight the complexity of effectively managing privacy in a big data
world.  Can anyone point me to useful research, resources, guides on this
issue?

Many thanks in advance... Steve Song

Hi Kyra

For cross referencing or adding to to the Wikipedia list, you might find
this spreadsheet of publishers useful (by Ross Mounce and the OKFN open
science working group):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdDFzdkVNQld6Mnc5NEpGWVlRUVhvM3c#gid=0

Ross also has another document set up for Jevin's list of gold OA journals (
http://www.eigenfactor.org/openaccess/index.php)
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdExBQm9UclBSaWxlMWVNelVDMHFnSkE#gid=0

This is the latest list of embargo periods from SHERPA RoMEO
http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/PDFandIR.html

Directory of Open Access Journals lists if a journal charges a fee but not
how much. It is available as a csv http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=csv

I have copied in the open-science and open-access lists where several
people are active in logging this kind of information and may have ideas on
the most efficient way to get it into Wikipedia!

Jenny

I think this is a great idea. Wiki* is increasingly going to underpin
scholarship (academia has not done a very good job).

You should keep in touch with DOAJ (directory of OA journals). It's been
relaunched. They have been patchy up to now, but may gte more comprehensive
in the future. Possibilities include:
* you feed off them.
* they feed of you
* mutual feeding.

They *should* be able to differentiate between licences. I think they don't
regard it as high priority.

At the risk of flooding almost all OKF lists I have added Open
Bibliography. Mark MacGillivray and others have tools for starting to
interrogate documents and their metadata about licences. Early days. But if
DOAJ don't do it, we shall have to use machines to do it.

Subject: [open-science] Mozilla FirefoxAppDay: Crowdcrafting app
Message-ID: <CAGS_vfoyJs2j0UZcdzOK_QkqVvvtUa1Q1hpBZmzFwCwwh0TfTw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Last Saturday, 26th of January, Mozilla held in parallel all over the world
a hack day<https://hacks.mozilla.org/2013/01/join-us-for-firefox-os-app-days/>,
#FirefoxOSAppDay,  about creating new apps for their new FirefoxOS
mobile OS<http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefoxos/>and desktop web
browser (this stills in beta and alpha mode!).

Luckily, one of the events was held in Madrid, organized by the Mozilla
Hispano community so I had the chance to expend some time with the Mozilla
community and hack a bit on this new OS.

As the goal was to create an app for the FirefoxOS, my idea was to create
an app that could help me, and others, to track when a new application has
been added to CrowdCrafting.org so I could help doing some tasks. The
application basically lets you know which apps are new since you checked it
the last time.

The application works in any browser (even Chrome) but if you want to feel
how it will be in the new OS you can try it in your phone if you have an
Android device. You will need to install the latest Firefox nightly and
then type this URL:

http://daniellombrana.es/crowdcrafting-app

You will be able to install it in your phone and run it whenever you want
directly from your home screen. If you don't want to install the browser,
just open the link with a modern web browser and you should see it running.

The official Tweet here:
https://twitter.com/teleyinex/status/295226239386521602 in Spanish :-)

Mozilla Labs re-tweeted it:

I hope you like it!

Subject: [open-science] Royal Society organised Open Access workshop 25th
	Feb, London
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzwB0uO3aweQx2DYyvBrLXcN9Mo33szzGUr4F+X1T5sfg@mail.gmail.com>

The Royal Society is hosting a special one-day workshop to discuss the
implications for scientific researchers of Government and funder policies
on open access publication, including the Research Councils? policy which
will take effect in April 2013 and HEFCE?s evolving policy in relation to
the post-2014 REF.

This will be a practical and constructive workshop that will help identify
and clarify key issues as we move towards implementation of these policies
and will be of particular interest to academic researchers and university
administrators.

*Dame Janet Finch* will chair the event and confirmed speakers include
*Dr Michael
Jubb*, Director of the Research Information Network, *David Sweeney*,
Director for Research, Innovation and Skills at HEFCE, *Dr Tony
Peatfield*, Medical
Research Council, Director of Corporate Affairs, *Professor David Price*,
Vice-Provost, Research, University College London, *Professor Tom Welton*,
Head of Chemistry at Imperial College, *Phil Sykes*, Librarian, University
of Liverpool, *Ian Russell*, Editorial Director, Science at Oxford
University Press, *Dr Nicola Gulley*, Editorial Director, IOP Publishing and
*Professor Geoffrey Smith*, Head of Department of Pathology, University of
Cambridge and *Professor Miles Padgett*, Dean of Research, University of
Glasgow.

The workshop will look at the background to the new policy announced by
David Willetts in July 2012, including the recommendations of the Finch
working group, and will address the practical challenges of implementation
from the perspectives of research funders, university and research
administrators, university librarians, publishers and different scientific
research communities.  It will also consider the implications of the
requirement of the Research Councils and the Wellcome Trust for authors to
use the CC-BY licence for their journal papers and conference proceedings.

The meeting will be held at the Royal Society on 25 February and is
sponsored by the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Institute of Physics, The
Royal Society, The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Society of Biology.

Subject: [open-science] BIS open access inquiry
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEwMcmnK2S9QUjOEdVYyfppU-hahV69mXgN3MvqPeK8tOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear lists,


Following-on the House of Lords
inquiry<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/open-access/>,
there is also a Business, Innovation and Skills Committee inquiry into the
new RCUK open access mandate. A fair few of the 70 or so written evidence
submissions<http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/Openaccess/OpenAccessevidence.pdf>
 to the House of Lords inquiry were quite misguided in my opinion and few
were from active researchers like myself.

I was wondering therefore if you would perhaps consider submitting some
written evidence to the BIS inquiry, further details
here<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news/committee-announces-an-inquiry-into-open-access/>
.

The Committee will consider a range of topics including:

   - The Government?s acceptance of the recommendations of the Finch Group
   Report ?Accessibility, sustainability, excellence: how to expand access to
   research publications?, including its preference for the ?gold? over the
   ?green? open access model;
   - Rights of use and re-use in relation to open access research
   publications, including the implications of Creative Commons ?CC-BY?
   licences;
   - The costs of article processing charges (APCs) and the implications
   for research funding and for the taxpayer; and
   - The level of ?gold? open access uptake in the rest of the world versus
   the UK, and the ability of UK higher education institutions to remain
   competitive.

Written evidence should be sent to the Committee, as an MS Word document,
by e-mail to biscommem at parliament.uk.
The deadline for BIS submissions is 7 February 2013.

I am particularly concerned about the confusion in many recent blog posts
in certain quarters over what Creative Commons licences actually do. Some
have been attempting to portray the CC Attribution licence (CC BY)  as
against 'author rights' or against 'academic freedom'. It would be good to
make clear the benefits of this, perhaps even in terms of economics.


This is a rare opportunity for for our voices to be heard. We should not
waste this opportunity. Academic publishers will almost certainly be
submitting their viewpoints and interests, so we need to make sure our
interests are represented too.


Best,

Ross

Subject: [open-science] CC-ND waver/license and data 'reuse'
Message-ID: <5108FC1D.7080704@gmail.com>

Hi Jenny, Peter, all,
calling on your expertise, please.
I am looking for real experiences and examples showing if and how a 
CC-ND waver/license for data files and related experimental descriptors 
_limits its reuse_ (as derivative works won't be allowed, e.g. data 
mush-ups, linked data).
Beside the official CC pages on CC-ND and several sites echoing the same 
text and theory, does any of you have direct experience on this matter? 
Of course, I have also seen http://opendefinition.org/licenses/ 
vshttp://opendefinition.org/licenses/nonconformant/
But pointers to articles and white papers, if available, are very much 
appreciated.
Many thanks,
Susanna

Apologies for brevity. On a train to Cambridge atm.

One memorable clear example of ND blocking innovative reuse is detailed by
Prof Rod Page in a couple of blog posts. Start here:

Here is a summary that documents the first two years of the move of the International Society of Hymenopterists' Journal of Hymenoptera Research http://tinyurl.com/bhc6x6n from traditional publishing to advanced XML based publishing making use of JATS derived taxonomy specific Taxpub NLM DTD. 

It clearly shows that there is a strong growth shown by the almost doubling of printed pages from the first to the second year. 

Whether this is a fluctuation or not will be shown in the future. It would also be interesting to learn more about the underlying business model.

Is more pages a good thing or a bad thing?

Not being a smartass, but really curious if that is a trick question.

It was a serious question.  It was prompted by a recent piece that I read
promoting Open Science which said that, in their opinion, the two biggest
hindrances to the advancement of science today were: 1) the paucity of open
access journals and 2) the lack of publicly available research data.  They
also had harsh words to say about the practices of not publishing negative
results and not publishing on attempts to replicate results.

However, the same article also decried the increase of volume of journal
articles which they attributed to a focus on bibliometrics. I think it's a
fair question what the correct quality/quantity tradeoff is.

Note, I'm not familiar with the OP's journal and wouldn't know a
Hymenoptera if it bit me in the tuchus, so don't have a personal opinion as
to whether more is better in this case.

I couldn't remember where I saw it when I wrote my reply, but just found it
again.

http://www.quora.com/Scientific-Research/What-are-the-biggest-things-that-are-slowing-down-scientific-research/answer/Franck-Dernoncourt

It may require registration.  I seem to remember something about Quora
changing their policy recently.
