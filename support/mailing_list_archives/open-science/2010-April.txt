Great work Mike! Love the various charts and statistics on endorsements.

I've given you admin access to the Panton Principles site. It would be
great if you would like to have a go at embedding some stats on the
endorsements page?

All the best,

Jonathan

I have already had a request for my "slides". As I don't "do Powerpoint" (on
principle) and in any case don't know what I shall say (it depends on what
who is present and what others have said) I really value any permanent
records.

This is an exciting and important question. It's of great relevance to
schools and society in general (interest and concerns about chemicals).

I have copied in the Blue Obelisk [the Open Data/Source/Standards movement
in chemistry] as I think this is a mixture of technical issues (see below)
and culture. Note that the Blue Obelisk has created enough Open packages and
experience to solve the technical aspects of the problem - it's a question
of what we want to do and the (possibly non-trivial) aspects of distributing
software and services.

I'm very sympathetic to this. There are a variety of possible approaches and
levels of precision. Chemical search is (overly) dominated by the aims of
the pharmaceuticl industry which has developed schemes for searching large
collections (millions or larger) with sophisticated algorithms. This
requires running chemical graph isomorpism software which must either run on
the server (i.e. each data set must be indexed for each new entry and the
software muct be run for each search) or on the client (few people do this
and it requires downloading the data for each search.) This is probably out
of scope and probably irrelevant to most users of CKAN. [There could be a
possibility of providing a metasearcher for Open chemistry but it would
require funding or cost recovery.]

At the other end are consitutional chemical formula and names. For example
"sodium sulfate" could be Na2SO4 or Na2O4S and searching for the string will
often fail. We have done quite a lot in representing formulae in Chemical
Markup Language and in RDF and we intend that SPARQL endpoints will be
coming onstream through several projects. Similarly textmining tools (such
as our Open OSCAR and OPSIN) can provide strings which can be matched in
SPARQL endpoints.

For chemical identity there is the IUPAC InChI which canonicalises the
formula if you know it exactly (sometimes you do, sometimes you don't). The
InChI for aspirin should be a unique string wherever it is found and this
allows all examples anywhere on the web to be found. I'd certainly suggest
that we inchify all molecules in CKAN collections (it only need to be done
once). However it becomes more difficult for multicomponent systems (e.g.
copper sulfate, where there may be 0 or 5 water molecules and the InChI for
these is different).

I think Wikipedia should be an excellent touchstone. See, for example,
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copper_sulfate. A chemical seach system running
over Wikipedia would be an excellent example of how to do this. It would be
fairly easy to index the thousands (not millions) of chemical entries in WP
and provide a chemical search endpoint (e.g. using the Openbabel software).
Again this needs hosting somewhere. Craig James from eMolecules has taken
steps in this direction and may be able to comment.

So in short I think it's a great idea for CKAN. There wil need to be a
variety of services (no one type hacks all) .
* index all molecules with InChI (for chemical identity). Static and easily
managed through SPARQL
* add CMLFormulae to all molecules. These are normalised and allow for
element counts and matching (e.g. all substances with 1 Cu, 1 S, 4 O and >0
water will find blue copper sulfate. SPARQL should be able to manage this
* host a substructure search for CKAN. This requires maintenance and server
resources. However it's ideal for the cloud if we have snapshots (and many
of our datasets will be "static"). Index them every so often (weeks, months,
whatever we can afford) and update the cloud. Needs a host and maybe a
sponsor.
* host a name2structure service using OPSIN/OSCAR nameResolver. This can
work out structures from names (2-acetoxy-benzoic acid is the formal name
for aspirin) and there are many LOD sources of synonyms (ChEBI, Pubchem,
etc.)

I suspect that combining forces with Wikipedia should be a god way of
maximising the facilities and impact.

Current search setup is documented here: <http://wiki.okfn.org/ckan/doc/search>

By structure or substructure search do you mean the ability to search
for specific chemical structures? Or do you mean something liked
faceted search or the ability to search on multiple attributes at
once?

If the latter we can do that already -- see the documentation. The
former would obviously require a way to search into the underlying
data package.

Rufus

 Peter - yes this is what I had in mind
Our solubility data is available as an XML feed - we use the tags
solventSMILES and soluteSMILES but that could be converted automatically to
InChIs.
http://showme.physics.drexel.edu/onsc/Services/OData.svc/Solubilities/

We would like to help out to provide feeds that could be automatically
integrated with the rest of the data.

Congress takes another stride toward public access to research
Federal Research Public Access Act introduced in the House of
Representatives

Washington, DC - Fueling the growing momentum toward openness,
transparency, and accessibility to publicly funded information, the
Federal Research Public Access Act of 2010 (FRPAA) has been introduced
today in the U.S. House of Representatives by Rep. Mike Doyle (D-PA)
and a bi-partisan host of co-sponsors. The proposed bill would build
on the success of the first U.S. mandate for public access to the
published results of publicly funded research at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), and require federal agencies with annual
extramural research budgets of $100 million or more to provide the
public with online access to research manuscripts stemming from funded
research no later than six months after publication in a peer-reviewed
journal.

"Free and open access to scientific literature and data are the
underpinnings of discovery in the digital age," said Stephen Friend MD
PhD, President and Co-Founder of Sage Bionetworks. "Full collaboration
among researchers is essential, and we have the power now to
communicate, collaborate, and innovate in ways that were previously
unimaginable. I applaud the sponsors of the Federal Research Public
Access Act for their commitment to ensuring the kind of access
scientists need to make progress on improved disease treatments and
diagnostics in the digital world."

Like the Senate bill introduced in 2009 by Senators Lieberman (I-CT)
and Cornyn (R-TX), H.R. 5037 would unlock unclassified research funded
by agencies including: Department of Agriculture, Department of
Commerce, Department of Defense, Department of Education, Department
of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of
Homeland Security, Department of Transportation, Environmental
Protection Agency, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the National Science Foundation.

H.R. 5037 follows closely on the heels of a recent expression of
interest in public access policies from the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, which issued a request for public
comment on mechanisms that would leverage federal investments in
scientific research and increase access to information that promises
to stimulate scientific and technological innovation and
competitiveness.

"This bill recognizes the urgent need - and opportunity - to use
digital technology to increase the pace of innovation," added Elliot
Schwartz, Vice President for Economic Studies at the Committee for
Economic Development. "The bill is a crucial, welcome move toward
advancing research through openness and avoiding making the taxpayer
pay twice for taxpayer-funded research. it is good public policy."
The introduction of H.R. 5037 was also welcomed by leaders in the
higher education community, who recognize this legislation helps to
ensure the United States is positioned to continue to fuel education
and innovation.

"Conducting critical research that enriches and improves lives has
always been a key mission of universities in this country, including
Ohio State," said E. Gordon Gee, president of The Ohio State
University. "Disseminating the knowledge gained from that research is
an equally important part of our institutions' public purpose. The
Federal Research Public Access Act will further spread new knowledge,
and it has my full support."

"Advancing research is at the core of the mission of higher education,
and broadening access to the scholarly record is a critical step in
helping research to advance to its fullest potential," added Karen
Hanson, Provost and Executive Vice President, Indiana University. "The
current system for exchanging the results of research is deeply
flawed, and major changes - like this bill - are required. I welcome
the introduction of the Federal Research Public Access Act."

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access thanks and congratulates
Representative Doyle and all of the bill's co-sponsors for championing
this pivotal legislation, and calls on organizations and individuals
to write in support of the bill through the Web site at
http://www.taxpayeraccess.org
.

the broad coalition that supports its passage, visit

###

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access is a coalition of patient, academic,
research, and publishing organizations that supports open public
access to the results of federally funded research. The Alliance was
formed in 2004 to urge that peer-reviewed articles stemming from
taxpayer-funded research become fully accessible and available online
at no extra cost to the American public. Details on the ATA may be
found at http://www.taxpayeraccess.org.

Yeah, I like to idea too... the implementation will need to undergo
some evolution, but I would love to see all university libraries act
as seeds (data providers) in the bittorrent networks... should be the
cheapest library investment in years... one decent computer per
library would do.

There used to be something like this for geodata (geotorrents.org) but
it has now disappeared. We've thought about torrent stuff quite a lot
before for data distribution [1] [2]. The problem with bittorrent (at
least in the small-time experiments we did) is it provides no
mechanism to do the storage-allocation you need for a real data
"grid", specifically:

a) How do you deal with large files (GBs) which individual peers may
not want to be responsible for holding and sharing in their entirety.
The obvious answer is sharding but bittorrent has no way for sharding
parts of a given file (so you need some mechanism above bittorrent to
do this)

b) (the biggie) how do you file/load allocation and rebalancing to
ensure you don't lose data as peers enter and leave the network. Even
with lots of participants how do you decide what files to allocate to
whom and how do you coordinate changes over time so you don't end up
with everyone hosting the same 1 file!

What you really need here is proper wide-area distributed storage
solution. We tried to build something along these lines last year
running a tahoe grid: <http://grid.okfn.org/> (more info in [3],
requirements in [2])

I would still say this is a (long) way from success due to the various
social and technical issues involved:

* you need your grid software to be (very) easy to install
* you may have significant storage and b/w impositions on users
* (most significant) you really need *big* scale to provide
reliability and availability -- unlike with say distributed processing
projects where activity can happen any old time and people can
allocate their processing whenever they want. With a storage grid you
really need either a) massive scale b) strong commitment to
participation from peers, to avoid problem that groups of users going
offline or leaving the grid doesn't compromise availability.

It would be no problem to create ckan packages linking to the relevant
torrents. Anyone with contacts with the biotorrents people so we could
have a chat?

Yes we'll definitely put material online - including slides and video.
Will blog/microblog when this is up!

Sorry to be just jumping in without tracking regularly -- but there are some
Stateside projects seeking to solve the problem that Rufus describes -- if
I'm not mistaken this is precisely what iRods (formerly at San Diego
Supercomputer Center now migrated to Univ of North Carolina) has set out to
address? [SEE: https://www.*irods*.org/ ]  and the NSF supported Tera-Grid
has been grappling with this as well: SEE: https://www.teragrid.org/ ]
and similarly the Open Science Grid [SEE:
http://www.opensciencegrid.org/About/News_Archive/Open_Science_Grid_Receives_30_Million_Dollar_Award]

I have been in some discvussions in past weeks and months with UNFCC, US
EPA, and others about how best to manage at least foundational data sets
("canonical"?) while providing precisely the level of transparency and
accountability that was obviously necessary in the recent IPCC dust-up...  I
believe that we may be best off picking certain such data and thoroughly
modeling best practice...???

think they're a long ways towards the goal.

This looks great, John! I hadn't seen this before. Do you know anyone
from the project that we could invite to the WG on open data in
science?

All the best,

Thanks a lot for these links Tom. I'd seen iRods before (I've also
just added it to [1]). When I last tried it out 1y+ ago the install
was non-trivial and I couldn't imagine getting a "volunteer" grid
going on this basis (it was unlikely the average dedicated server
owner was going to get through that setup!).

[1]: <http://wiki.okfn.org/p/Distributed_Storage/Research>

Perhaps it is worth explicitly listing the requirements we put
together (listed on [1]):

  1. Robustness via replication across nodes
  2. Easy addition of nodes -- in particular we wish people to be able
to easily "donate" nodes
  3. Require good share/shard-rebalancing as nodes enter and leave network
  4. The system should be able to handle small and very large files
(so files should be automatically sharded)
  5. Concurrency/Consistency is not a big issue
  6. Availability is a big issue
  7. Versioning would be nice (though what exactly would this mean?)
  8. Data stored would be open so encryption/privacy is not a priority

These both seem to be services rather than "software" -- I may have
missed something but I couldn't see that the software behind e.g. open
science grid open source and available for download?

Indeed. I certainly think it would be interesting to find out more
what is on offer and *in particular* people's actual experience using
that software or service -- perhaps updates to
<http://wiki.okfn.org/p/Distributed_Storage/Research>.

Thanks John, we'd already got that on the listing :)

<http://wiki.okfn.org/p/Distributed_Storage/Research#Tranche>

They seemed to have adopted a hybrid centralized/p2p model
<http://code.google.com/p/tranche/wiki/WhitePaper#Introduction>:

<quote>
Second, the repository is a hybrid model that uses concepts from both
the peer-to-peer networks and centralized servers, so it can best be
described as a "distributed server model". Because we are frequently
dealing with very large data sets that must be available at all times,
a pure peer-to-peer model would not be feasible since nodes
continuously enter and leave the network. Furthermore, a centralized
model presents other issues such as scalability, and places the entire
burden of hosting hardware on one group or organization. Our model
accommodates a reasonable amount of individual server downtime, as
well as permitting the replacement of old servers and the addition of
new servers to meet growing space requirements.
</quote>

I'd be interested to hear of any experience people have had with Tranche ...

Hi Rufus --
I have not tested iRods firsthand, when I was at Getty we were involved in
some trials
with them -- but given its origins at SDSCC, I'm sure you're right that it
is  probably
"non-trivial"  in terms of rapid and easy deployment (!) -- but perhaps
their trial
approaches may  be instructive in informing future developments...?

In the same spirit, I mentioned Tera-grid and Open Science as projects/
services
with substantial NSF support but -- again -- connections to those projects
-- and
how they are addressing the problems you've posed may prove fruitful
in analysis and development?

 I think the notion of a developing a full  "specification/ requirements
document is very useful step
 -- perhaps we should all consider your list and see if we can review it for
comprehensiveness
 and adequacy to our common purposes?

(I think as John suggests bio-med and genomics -- not areas of primary focus
for me personally --
have made important progress toward standards for transparency,
interoperability and meta-analysis.
After the recent  "Climate-gate"/IPCC  events,  I am hopeful that we can
better prototype
best practices in applied sciences and consider *the complete data
cycle*from data creation not to
deposit/curation (often the end point in descirptions of the "data cycle"but
to "data as evidence"
for policy formation and decision-support. It is specifically the
requirement of delivering data
with full transparency-accountability (lineage/provenance)
in ways that are quickly understandable by policy makers and decision makers
and
more easily subject to review and testing that I believe challenges us...?)

I'm giving a talk on Open Knowledge and Science at OKCon tomorrow and
would like to highlight some of the very recent developments. However
I don't want to clash with others. I am particularly interested in
presenting:
* The Open bibliography proposal ( which we submitted this week)
jointly from OKF and Dept of Chemistry.
* The Panton Principles (OKF)
* IsItOpen (OKF)

and an more general review of what we need to do to REALLY make
science Open. We saw last week from Stefano Costa (nice work, thanks)

http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/okfn-discuss/2010-April/007238.html

that most of bioscience is NOT Open.

I sort of knew this already but not in detail. The main problems are:

* ignorance
* antiquity (the "rules" were often formulated 20 years ago)
* technical inertia (it's not totally trivial to relicence data)
* hidden agendas (we want to control this data)

So this my agenda:
* Science is not actually Open
* Most scientists do not understand the issues
* Many are well disposed to adopt Openness once it's been explained
(but some are deliberately not!)
* Open Access publishers are not generally aware of the issues; they
need guidance
* Some funders are aware; but all need guidance
* Closed access publishers will require a lot of engagement. A few are
sympathetic but have inertia; many are hostile and some are worse.
* Individuals can do a LOT!

If that overlaps badly with others please let me know.

FWIW I do NOT use Powerpoint
(http://ilovecharts.tumblr.com/post/450388944/brownpau-everytime-you-make-a-powerpoint)
but tailor my presentation to the people at the meeting. See:


Really looking forward to it.

Research integrity: the role of good data management and open data sharing

British Library Conference Centre, London

Organised by JISC and the British Library with the Natural
Environment, Economic and Social and Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Councils

How researchers manage their data has been thrown under the public
spotlight by recent events at the University of East Anglia over
climate data. This major one day conference for researchers and
institutional managers will look at ways in which public confidence in
science can be restored through good management of the research data
lifecycle. High profile plenary speakers will set the scene and
inspire with examples of data sharing, drawn from the environmental,
social and bio- sciences, that have lead to new research and
collaborations that would otherwise have been impossible. The event
will also address the question: how open can science be?

Delegates will choose two out of four strands examining:
? ? ? ? researchers? and institutions? obligations under current
legislation to make their data publicly available;
? ? ? ? how the integrity of the published record can be maintained
through linking research data directly to journal articles;
? ? ? ? the practicalities of managing research data to make it
available to a broad range of audiences;
? ? ? ? the advantages and future implications of making research data ?open?.

. . . and will come away informed about:
? ? ? ? their obligations to manage and share their research data;
? ? ? ? the advice and guidance available from JISC, the RCs and the BL;
? ? ? ? some of the positive outcomes resulting from research data sharing
? ? ? ? the issues around making research data openly available

Further information will be posted at www.jisc.ac.uk/researchintegrity

Yes, it does look interesting, but seems to be postponed?

Subject: [open-science] Looking for Coordinator for Working
Message-ID: <0D2AF55F-AF42-4472-B354-E10FF9A53487@okfn.org>

Dear all,

Here at the Open Knowledge Foundation we're currently looking at how we can increase the momentum of our various Working Groups - with more regular meetings and more interesting projects and activities to promote open data and open content. We're also keen to continue to decentralise our activities away from our core team to include more of the community of people interested in open knowledge in different domains.

As part of this process we are looking for a volunteer to take on the role of Coordinator for the Open Data in Science Working Group - to chair regular virtual meetings, to help gather and come up with new ideas about what the group should do next, and generally to help keep things ticking over!

Please drop us a line if you think you might be interested in this role!

Sara
