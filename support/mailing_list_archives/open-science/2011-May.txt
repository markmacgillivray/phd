Dear All

Some more info from Andrea, who is organising the conference. I sent him
brief details of our proposals. His ideas (full email further down):

I'm thinking about planning two days before the workshop. We already have
some tutorial proposed, but I think it would be good to have as well a more
informal "hackathon-like" space.
Just as an example:
we could have:
Wednesday: hackathons
Thursday: Tutorial + evening/discussion/panel on open data in science
Friday: Workshop, where some results from the hackathon can be presented in
the poster/demo session.
Last year the hackathon experience was capped to 20pp and it was
interesting, but a bit disorganized. It ended up being a big tutorial.
The problem with setting a topic too tightly is that participants may come
from different backgrounds and it's hard to find a common focus.
I can probably gather a few people interested in pathways information,
though.
Another option would be to have a more loose setting where we have some open
data/semantic web "clinics".
Yet another idea could be to have a tutorial on the use of CKAN technologies
for Life Sciences.

Would anyone be willing to join a Skype discussion about this if we can find
a time when Andrea is free? Peter, maybe you would be a good person to
discuss how to run a hackathon for people with diverse interests?

Jenny

Dear Jenny,

let me explain better my situation.
I'm going to organize a workshop on Semantic Web applications for the Life
Sciences in London this year (late november, beginning of december).
The workshop is at its 4th edition and so far it has been pretty successful.
Up to last year, it consisted of a one day workshop with a traditional
academic style: presentations of peer-reviewed papers, keynotes, panel,
poster/demo session, and a special issue associated in an international
journal.
In the past edition in Berlin, we have added to the 1 day workshop 2 days of
tutorials and hackathon-like events (see the link to the 2010 edition from
the swat4ls.org website).
The workshop itself has been on sound basis so far (we had 50 submissions
for a 1 day workshop last year), it will likely run on Friday and follow a
traditional pattern.
I'm thinking about planning two days before the workshop. We already have
some tutorial proposed, but I think it would be good to have as well a more

How do these ideas sound ? Perhaps we can catch-up on Skype and discuss it a
bit.

If this is bioscience pathways I think it may be too narrow. A topic such as
semantic graphs would cover some of it and a lot more...

Dear Open-Science community,

my name is Ren? Dreos and I am a bioinformatician with a biology background
interested in gene expression and genomes data analysis.
For my projects, I often have to analyse and combine data generated in
different labs (downloading them from Internet repositories like EBI or
NCBI). You can imagine that although there are standard for data
repositories it is quite difficult for me to collect all the information
needed for a correct data analysis. This ultimately could lead to
misinterpretation of the results or missing opportunities (and waste of
time/money). I would really like to know what you think about this and how
Open-Science could help in solving it. I know the problem is complex and, if
you agree, I would like to bring my personal experience to this community
and try to solve it.

Kind regards

What is the difficulty - access? knowledge/discovery? resources?

The problem is complex, I am afraid! At least Open data is not a problem in
most bioinformatics. I suspect that your main requirement is appropriate
identifiers and ontologies.

I suspect that many of your problems will need to be addressed in a
domain-specific manner but if there are general scientific ones then keep
mailing...

Hello,

If I understand the issue correctly, you are looking for a way to
extend MIAME standard (Minimum Information About a Microarray
Experiment http://www.mged.org/Workgroups/MIAME/miame.html ), so it
contains all information required for a correct data analysis. Or in
other words, you'd like to solve the issue of "how" to make data open,
not "if", as life scientists share data quite often. In that case, it
could be reasonable to contact people from FGED Society and work
directly with them.

"Standard" is the next holy grail after data become available. Open
Science helps indirectly by pushing towards data availability -
standards are developed by researchers trying to integrate data. I
don't know, however, if it could help directly, by coordinating
efforts of building common/reusable ontologies across different
domains/fields.

Best regards
PS

data award last night and BMC are goind a huge amount to promote and require
Panton compliance in publications. So if there is something that could be
urged as good open publication practice (?GOPP) then we should catalyse its
formation and description.

A list of MIAME (and all the other MI***s) could be very useful to show
authors what should be published. This would be core OKF "business", while
actually generating the specifications is already well handeld by the
bioscience community.

Subject: European Commission Information Hearing on Scientific Information
To:


 Dear Madam, dear Sir,

Further to the 2007 Commission Communication on Scientific information in
the digital age and the following Council Conclusions in November 2007, the
Commission intends to adopt, by the end of 2011, a new Communication and
Recommendation on access to and preservation of scientific information in
the digital age. This is a joint action of the Directorate-Generals for
Information Society and Media and Research and Innovation.

The follow-on Communication and Recommendation on Scientific Information
planned will take stock of developments since 2007 and indicate areas for
action by Member States and the Commission. This initiative is linked to the
Flagship Initiatives 'Digital Agenda for Europe' and 'Innovation Union', as
well as to the European Research Area (ERA) process.

As part of the process of consultation of interested parties, and in view of
preparing the impact assessment, the Commission will hold a hearing* on
Monday 30th of May from 10:00 to 17:00***. The hearing will take place in
the Jean Monnet Building Room M1 - European Commission - Kirchberg L-2920,
Luxembourg.

***Topics for discussion:***

The Commission is seeking stakeholders' views on current developments in the
scholarly information system. In particular, the following issues should be
addressed:
1. access to scientific information (including open access),
2. preservation of scientific outputs,
3. the research evaluation system.
For each of these areas, actions at the European and Member State levels
should be considered.
*Practical arrangements:***

Registrations for the hearing should reach the following address by 17th May
2011:* INFSO-E4 at ec.europa.eu*

The maximum number of participants is limited to 80. Registrations will be
accepted in the order in which they are received. However, the Commission
will reserve the right to give priority to those with a direct interest in
the topic, and will ensure that there is a balanced representation all
concerned parties.

Confirmation of registration and details of the venue will be sent one week
prior to the scheduled date. Upon registration, and in order to facilitate
the organisation, each participant should therefore indicate the topic(s)
which they wish to address. On this basis, the Commission services will draw
up a speaker's list for each topic. Interventions should be limited to not
more than 5 minutes per speaker (without PowerPoint slides) followed by a
discussion / questions& answer session with the attendees.

Cordially,

Richard Swetenham
Head of Unit, Access to Information Unit, DG Information Society and Media

Gilles Laroche
Head of Unit, Ethics and Gender Unit, DG Research and Innovation

Yes we should definitely produce something for this - and try to have
someone from the WG attend as a speaker...

Peter, Cameron, Rufus, John: could any of you speak about the Panton Principles?

This might conceivably be possible for me but looking at the topic list maybe I should focus on the evaluation angle and could pull in someone else for the availability part? Or if that's not feasible I could try and cover all three. I'm juggling a lot of things in that week at the minute though.

Cheers

It's a UK Bank Holiday (May 30th). That might rule me out. But we should
bung something in this weekend (says first-come first-served).

Surprised to see only one mention of "open data" on page 30. A shame that
there isn't a brief step by step guide to openly licensing data in the
guide!

Does anyone know any of the authors of this that we could contact - to see
if they'd consider putting this in next time?

---------- Forwarded message ----------
The UK Data Archive has just published the 3rd edition of its 'Managing and
Sharing Data - best practice for researchers' guide.
It is available online at: *
http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/media/2894/managingsharing.pdf*<http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/media/2894/managingsharing.pdf>
Hard copies can be requested from *Communications
enquiries*<comms at data-archive.ac.uk>
.
This edition contains much new content, illustrated with numerous case
studies. Guidance is aimed at researchers across the natural and social
sciences and humanities, and covers:

    - why and how to share research data
   - data management planning and costing
   - documenting data
   - formatting data
   - storing data
   - ethics and consent in data sharing
   - data copyright
   - data management strategies for large investments

New and updated guidance results from working closely with researchers,
centres and programmes within the JISC-funded Data Management Planning for
ESRC Research Data-rich Investments (DMP-ESRC) project.
The guide is published thanks to funding from the Joint Information Systems
Committee (JISC), the Rural Economy and Land Use (Relu) Programme and the UK
Data Archive.

Peter, are you thinking of a table of data standards, like this one?
http://otter.oerc.ox.ac.uk/biosharing/?q=standards-table

BioSharing  and the BMC Research Notes open data series are working
together<http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/bmc_research_notes_and_biosharing>to
flush out that table.  If anyone is familiar with a data sharing
standard
that doesn't yet have a publication in the Publication column, please submit
a paper to the open data series!  :)

this is a trending part of the data conversation that i am seeing 
worldwide - licenses on data are considered a tiny part of overall data 
management. the UK is the most progressive, and the US default position 
of public domain is nice (though we are continuing to press for its 
being in the PD globally, and not just domestically). but when the 
scientists who are not on this list gather to talk data with their 
funders, IP is rarely at the top of the agenda.

it is of course essential, but far from sufficient, for data to be 
"open" - if it's not annotated, doesn't have provenance, doesn't have 
tracks of how it came from its original raw forms to the intermediate 
processed forms that are so much more useful, doesn't have tracks of the 
feedback loops that processed it, etc.

i now spend much of my time these days *outside* the open science world, 
in what they call out here the "big data" world. most of the data people 
i talk to are obsessed with all of the ways data is made a) useful via 
tooling and annotation and b) social (in the sense of the feedback loops 
and conversations among big data users, not in the facebook sense) and 
are not very concerned with the openness of data in the absence of a) 
and b).

we've got to get serious as a community about addressing these things 
ourselves, or we risk becoming a one-note community obsessed with 
whether or not data is "open" rather than joining the debate about how 
to make data *useful* - and making the open argument a key to that 
broader one.

Thanks for including me on this run.

I'm actually doing essentially zero international travel for work this 
summer other than a long-standing commitment to be in Prague in the 
middle of May. Being a new father has become my priority :-)

However, we've got Diane Cabell from the CC Board in Oxford for the next 
two years. She'll go from the CC side. I will brief her but it'd be good 
to connect you all in advance to synchronize watches.

I can't agree with John more. Well put.

This is a bit of an aside, but I have 2 years of funding for a Research Fellow/postdoctoral fellow to address policy issues in the data and bioresource commons. The issues will largely surround animal models for human diseases, but can also capture issues related to drug discovery more broadly.  If any of you know of a person interested in moving to the University of Alberta for two years to work with me on this opportunity (with the caveat that they also be keen on analysing data and publishing paper, of course), please do let me know so that I can forward a formal job advertisement. I would prefer a person with a science policy/legal background, although a law degree is not essential. The position could start anytime in the Fall through January of next year.

Thanks

this is a trending part of the data conversation that i am seeing
worldwide - licenses on data are considered a tiny part of overall data
management. the UK is the most progressive, and the US default position
of public domain is nice (though we are continuing to press for its
being in the PD globally, and not just domestically). but when the
scientists who are not on this list gather to talk data with their
funders, IP is rarely at the top of the agenda.

it is of course essential, but far from sufficient, for data to be
"open" - if it's not annotated, doesn't have provenance, doesn't have
tracks of how it came from its original raw forms to the intermediate
processed forms that are so much more useful, doesn't have tracks of the
feedback loops that processed it, etc.

i now spend much of my time these days *outside* the open science world,
in what they call out here the "big data" world. most of the data people
i talk to are obsessed with all of the ways data is made a) useful via
tooling and annotation and b) social (in the sense of the feedback loops
and conversations among big data users, not in the facebook sense) and
are not very concerned with the openness of data in the absence of a)
and b).

we've got to get serious as a community about addressing these things
ourselves, or we risk becoming a one-note community obsessed with
whether or not data is "open" rather than joining the debate about how
to make data *useful* - and making the open argument a key to that
broader one.

Subject: [open-science] Making use of data: tools,
 process and openness (was: Re: Fwd: New edition UKDA guide:
 Managing and Sharing Data)
Message-ID: <BANLkTinapeM1gt8ccJQFRgZtu_UL3XupLw@mail.gmail.com>

[Changing subject to reflect change of thread direction]

Great comment John. I'd like to expand on it!

In almost all the talks (e.g. [1]) I give I aim, at least once, to
make the statement along the lines:

"Openness is *not* an end in itself, it's a means to an end"

The *real end* being the creation, processing and use
information/knowledge more effectively for the purpose of bettering,
in some way or other our own lives and the world around us -- be that
finding a better way to travel to work, improved understanding and
predictions of climate change, a better way to select a stock
portfolio, working out who to vote for ...

Now there are clearly a very large set of things that can contribute
to us getting better at the "creation, processing and use of
information" but I'd argue that the following are particularly
important (clearly these all interlink ...):

1. Scalability -- i.e. to deal with large amounts of material
2. (Improved) Tools, techniques and process
3. Wide access to the raw data and content

[I'd also add a fourth item but strictly it isn't a requirement but a
personal desire!: 4. To do this in a collaborative, distributed and
decentralized manner -- avoiding the centralization of information
'power' (be that in the actual control of information or in 'refining'
(processing))]

Now I'd argue that openness -- both of data/content and of tools -- is
really important to each of these:

1. Scalability - central, in my view, to successful 'data scaling'
will be componentization: breaking up material into maintainable
chunks (components) that can be recombined. However, without openness
recombination will rapidly become extremely hard -- if not impossible
-- as one has to clear rights with all of the different providers of
data.

2. Tools, technique and process. Open data makes it much easier to
develop and share tools, techniques and processes for working with
data.

3. Wider access to the material: given the vast amount of material
becoming available we're going to want as many people as possible (and
not just 'professionals') to be able to access, experiment with and
redistribute that data as easily as possible (cf. the many minds
principle: the best thing to do with your data will be though of by
someone else).

To sum up then: I completely agree with you John that "doing useful
stuff" with the data is the central thing (in some sense the only
thing). We should always make clear that openness is important because
of what it helps us do not because it is an end in itself.

Furthermore, tooling, annotation, feedback loops [2] etc are
absolutely central (which is why more I'd estimate that much more than
50% of the Open Knowledge Foundation's time and resource is spent on
developing tools, platforms, techniques like CKAN [2] for working with
(open) data and content).

At the same time, as I've outlined above, I think openness is pretty
central to making significant progress "doing useful stuff". Given
this, I think it is important that we do "go on" about *open* data --
not, of course, in an obsessive ideological are-you-in/are-you-out way
but in an exhortatory, this-matters-to-what-we-can-build way. This is
especially true at the present time, when the default in most areas
still seems to be non-open.

Peter, I do want to stress here, that the data we see on the web, is
not in fact the data we like to have access to and need for decent
data analysis. There, the data is actually not so open, and much
closer to habits in chemistry. There are fields in biology where data
is Open (sequencing), but a large part is not.

This is one of the reasons why we have this session tomorrow in our EU
project [0]. Seriously, the Open in bio seems driven by journal
requirements more than ideology...

Yes - as usual I am happy to demonstrate my ignorance  and be enlightened.!

If all of this is Open and collaborative then the problem seems to be

All good points, and well taken.

I'd add on a few bits...

first, data != knowledge, at least, not most of the time, and especially 
not in the sciences. Data that's related to things where we have basic 
agreement on terminology, like latitude and longitude, is a lot closer 
to knowledge than data that's related to terminology that is constantly 
changing, which is the case in most interesting science areas. If the 
ontology isn't shifting, the science is boring. That's why most science 
data management plans don't focus on whether the data are open or 
closed, but on whether or not the data are annotated, whether or not the 
various processes that have operated on the data have been tracked, 
whether or not the software models that turned that data into something 
closer to knowledge were as valid as they can be, etc - it's certainly 
where the US NSF is going. IP takes about a day, the rest of this takes 
months.

second, science != science. there is not a lot of annotation that is 
useful in the life sciences that is useful to the physicist, whereas the 
annotation on city streets created by open street map folks can be 
re-used and mashed up against city bus data that tracks against other 
street data. science isn't science; it's dozens if not hundreds of 
disciplines that to one level or another follow some variation of the 
scientific method, but don't share ontology or ideology or practice. 
note egon and peter's exchange about open bioinformatics earlier today - 
from the outside, peter finds it open, from the inside, egon further 
subdivides bioinformatics into sequencing and everything else, with 
sequencing forced open not by ideology but by journal practice. that 
little exchange lets us see an ocean in a grain of sand.

(paul david's work in this space is essential reading, if one is 
interested - his papers are available at 
http://ideas.repec.org/e/pda76.html)

third, data doesn't necessarily get "better" if it's open, unlike open 
source software or open content like wikipedia. with enough eyes, all 
data may be useful, but all data bugs aren't necessarily fixable by 
enough eyes and hands. this is something that i took a long time to 
understand, that i didn't get until i spent a lot of time around the 
folks doing open bio data at sage and open energy data at openei. bad 
data, open or closed, is actively harmful and unfixable in a way that 
bad code isn't. poorly annotated data is a close second in terms of 
harmfulness, but annotations - unlike the underlying measurements - can 
indeed get better via incremental edits. i'd love to see a heavier focus 
on open, incremental annotation systems as part of the open science 
movement, not the IPR status of the underlying dataset (which often 
cannot be made "open" as per OKD or other definitions for privacy 
reasons, but can be made available under a very low transaction cost 
contract regime if one agrees to standard terms and conditions).

obviously i think open is essential. i'm infamous for my public domain 
preferences.

but i am worried that the we are too often focused on open in the 
service of open, not open in the service of making data useful. we ask 
if it's closed, not if it's annotated, not if there's a plan to preserve 
it over time, not if there's a way to know where it came from so we can 
know if we trust it, not if there's a model that can turn it into 
something useful.

it's not like the open access movement, where we had to push back hard 
against an industry that wanted - wants - to keep everything closed. 
there isn't a data publishing industry to fight against. there's a group 
of people all trying to figure out how to live in a data rich world. we 
as the open science community are part of that group. our job is to 
convince them that being part of our group is key to their success, too...

thanks rufus for provoking, looking forward to seeing you virtually on 
the webinar tomorrow.

Subject: [open-science] Making use of data: tools, process and openness
In-Reply-To: <BANLkTinapeM1gt8ccJQFRgZtu_UL3XupLw@mail.gmail.com>

All good points, and well taken.

I'd add on a few bits...

first, data != knowledge, at least, not most of the time, and especially 
not in the sciences. Data that's related to things where we have basic 
agreement on terminology, like latitude and longitude, is a lot closer 
to knowledge than data that's related to terminology that is constantly 
changing, which is the case in most interesting science areas. If the 
ontology isn't shifting, the science is boring. That's why most science 
data management plans don't focus on whether the data are open or 
closed, but on whether or not the data are annotated, whether or not the 
various processes that have operated on the data have been tracked, 
whether or not the software models that turned that data into something 
closer to knowledge were as valid as they can be, etc - it's certainly 
where the US NSF is going. IP takes about a day, the rest of this takes 
months.

second, science != science. there is not a lot of annotation that is 
useful in the life sciences that is useful to the physicist, whereas the 
annotation on city streets created by open street map folks can be 
re-used and mashed up against city bus data that tracks against other 
street data. science isn't science; it's dozens if not hundreds of 
disciplines that to one level or another follow some variation of the 
scientific method, but don't share ontology or ideology or practice. 
note egon and peter's exchange about open bioinformatics earlier today - 
from the outside, peter finds it open, from the inside, egon further 
subdivides bioinformatics into sequencing and everything else, with 
sequencing forced open not by ideology but by journal practice. that 
little exchange lets us see an ocean in a grain of sand.

(paul david's work in this space is essential reading, if one is 
interested - his papers are available at 
http://ideas.repec.org/e/pda76.html)

third, data doesn't necessarily get "better" if it's open, unlike open 
source software or open content like wikipedia. with enough eyes, all 
data may be useful, but all data bugs aren't necessarily fixable by 
enough eyes and hands. this is something that i took a long time to 
understand, that i didn't get until i spent a lot of time around the 
folks doing open bio data at sage and open energy data at openei. bad 
data, open or closed, is actively harmful and unfixable in a way that 
bad code isn't. poorly annotated data is a close second in terms of 
harmfulness, but annotations - unlike the underlying measurements - can 
indeed get better via incremental edits. i'd love to see a heavier focus 
on open, incremental annotation systems as part of the open science 
movement, not the IPR status of the underlying dataset (which often 
cannot be made "open" as per OKD or other definitions for privacy 
reasons, but can be made available under a very low transaction cost 
contract regime if one agrees to standard terms and conditions).

obviously i think open is essential. i'm infamous for my public domain 
preferences.

but i am worried that the we are too often focused on open in the 
service of open, not open in the service of making data useful. we ask 
if it's closed, not if it's annotated, not if there's a plan to preserve 
it over time, not if there's a way to know where it came from so we can 
know if we trust it, not if there's a model that can turn it into 
something useful.

it's not like the open access movement, where we had to push back hard 
against an industry that wanted - wants - to keep everything closed. 
there isn't a data publishing industry to fight against. there's a group 
of people all trying to figure out how to live in a data rich world. we 
as the open science community are part of that group. our job is to 
convince them that being part of our group is key to their success, too...

thanks rufus for provoking, looking forward to seeing you virtually on 
the webinar tomorrow.

Dear All

Just to let you know, Enrico Damiano has kindly translated the Panton
Principles into Italian on the suggestion of Stefano Costa. The translation
is now available at http://pantonprinciples.org/translations/. Thank you,
Enrico!

Thus far we have translations in Catalan, Italian, Polish and Russian. If
anybody would be able to expand this list, or knows of someone who might be
interested in translating the principles to another language, do get in

Yes, thanks to Enrico and Stefano. There is an n-squared effect here - 4
languages is twice as compelling as 3 so keep asking for translations. And
translations help to add to the public acceptance of the PP.

Dear All,

thank you very much for this interesting discussion. I did not aspected such
a great response from you.
I totally agree with Peter when he correctly pointed out that data in
science is quite open and what need to be improved is "how" data is
presented. For this to be implemented, following the correct ontology is
essential. But as Egon wrote, most of the time data are shared just because
journals required it, not for an intrinsic desire of sharing info. If you
add that we have dead-lines for publishing papers, the info for a correct
analysis are often not well presented or missing (how long does it take to
write a paper compared to upload a dataset in GEO?). Would it be nice to
have a tool (?) to help scientists upload their data using the correct
ontology and providing just the right amount of informations needed?

best

Fully agree with you John. The guide is a big, rich document with lots
of useful stuff in it. I just wanted to make sure that open licensing
was included - definitely don't think it should be the main thing, let
alone the only note. ;-)

Many thanks for getting in touch Veerle!

We'd be delighted to contribute a short section on open data
licensing. Could you let me know when the next edition is coming out,
and we'll get drafting! :-)

All the best,

Jonathan

I thought this might be a good point to flag up, for anyone not yet aware of 
it, that the DCC has already produced a guide to licensing data somewhat along 
the lines that Jonathan suggests:

http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/how-guides/license-research-data

It has its own CC licence if you want to re-use any of it...

Cheers,
Alex.

And apparently, even if the journals requires it, it only happens in
10 - 25% percent then:

"Two studies have found that only a minority of researchers (10% and
25%) share data when publishing in journals with explicit policies
that raw data must be made available."

Yes - this is great Alex. Only two things which I would add to the top:

  * Simple step by step instructions to using/applying a data license
  * Clear guidance/recommendation on which licenses to use (e.g. PDDL,
ODbL, CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA).

John, Rufus: lots of good stuff in your emails. Wonder if either of
you fancy bashing any of these ideas into blog posts for
blog.okfn.org? Could be a lovely couplet! :-D

E.g.

  * "Open data is not enough" or "Science doth not thrive upon open
data alone" (John's original post)
  * "Why openness matters" (Rufus's four point piece below)

Also think it would be great to have more public call/response on some
of the key issues that the OKF works on (another big one being: RDF -
for/against).

I see the following arguments for Openness:
* moral
* legal
* ethical
* utilitarian.

In talking generally I pften only take the last one. - "This is what we
can/could do with openness"

The issues are very strong in text-mining. We *could* make major scientific
discoveries IF we were allowed to text-mine. We could determines what was
good science from bad science. We could avoid large amounts of duplicated
effort == money.

Peter: your recent post on the list reminded me that it would be great
to also have a guest blog post on blog.okfn.org from you/others on:

  (i) what text mining is
  (ii) its role within scientific research, what it lets us do, etc
  (iii) rights issues with text-mining
  (iv) what we can do to make text-mining possible/easier (e.g. open
licenses, ...)

What do you think? I think this would be really useful - especially
for non-scientists, or others who don't know about this.

All the best,

Jonathan

Principios Panton
Principios para abrir los datos cient?ficos
La ciencia se basa en aprovechar, reutilizar y criticar abiertamente
el cuerpo de conocimiento cient?fico publicado.
Para que la ciencia funcione de modo efectivo, y para que la sociedad
pueda aprovechar plenamente las ventajas de las actividades
cient?ficas, es fundamental que los datos cient?ficos se abran.
En el ?mbito de la ciencia por datos abiertos nos referimos a su
disponibilidad gratuita en Internet permitiendo a cualquier usuario
descargarlos, copiarlos, analizarlos, volverlos a procesar,
transferirlos a un software, o utilizarlos para cualquier otro
prop?sito, sin barreras econ?micas, legales o t?cnicas fuera de
aquellas que son inseparables del acceso a Internet. Con este fin, los
datos asociados a las publicaciones cient?ficas debieran ser
expl?citamente colocados en el dominio p?blico.
Formalmente, recomendamos adoptar y actuar de acuerdo a los siguientes
principios:

1. ?????En el momento de publicar los datos o colecciones de datos es
fundamental que dicha publicaci?n est? acompa?ada de una declaraci?n
clara y expl?cita de los deseos y expectativas de quienes los publican
con respecto a la reutilizaci?n, y prop?sitos de uso de los elementos
individuales de los datos, de la colecci?n completa as? como de
subconjuntos dentro de la colecci?n. Esta declaraci?n debe ser
inequ?voca, irrevocable y en lenguaje legal adecuado de modo que tome
la forma de renuncia o licencia.

En el momento de publicar haga una declaraci?n expl?cita y clara de
sus deseos respecto de los datos que publica.

2. ?????Muchas de las renuncias al derecho y licencias ya reconocidas
no tienen como objetivo ni son apropiadas para datos o colecciones de
datos. Aqu? ?est?n descritas algunas de las licencias que han sido
dise?adas y s? son apropiadas para el manejo de datos. ?Las licencias
del ?Creative Commons? (con excepci?n de CCZero), GFDL, GPL, BSD, etc,
NO son adecuadas para datos y se desaconseja ENCARECIDAMENTE su uso.

Utilice una renuncia o una licencia reconocida que sea apropiada para datos.

3. ?????Se desaconseja ENCARECIDAMENTE el uso de licencias que limitan
la reutilizaci?n comercial o limitan la producci?n de obras derivados
mediante la exclusi?n del uso para fines particulares o de personas u
organizaciones espec?ficas. Estas licencias imposibilitan la efectiva
integraci?n de los conjuntos de datos y su utilizaci?n para nuevos
prop?sitos e impiden actividades comerciales que podr?an ser ?tiles
para la preservaci?n de los datos.

Si desea que sus datos sean utilizados con eficacia y puedan recibir
contribuciones de terceros su publicaci?n debe ser de forma abierta de
acuerdo a la definici?n establecida en Open Knowledge/Data Definition
- en particular, no deben utilizarse clausulas restrictivas tales como
las que impiden usos con fines comerciales.

4. ?????Adem?s en el ?mbito cient?fico se recomienda ENCARECIDAMENTE
que los datos, especialmente aquellos que resultan de subsidios
p?blicos, sean expl?citamente colocados en el dominio p?blico a trav?s
de la Entrega y Licencia al Dominio P?blico (PDDL) o la renuncia o
licencia de Creative Commons Cero (CCZero). Esto est? en consonancia
con el subsidio p?blico de gran parte de la actividad cient?fica y con
los c?digos de ?tica ?de compartir y reutilizar datos dentro de la
comunidad cient?fica.

Se recomienda encarecidamente la entrega expl?cita al dominio p?blico
de los datos que acompa?an las publicaciones mediante licencias PDDL o
CCZero que garantizan el cumplimiento del protocolo del acceso abierto
a los datos del Science Commons (Protocol for Implementing Open Access
Data) y la definici?n del Open Knowledge/Data Definition.

Jenny: could you possibly put a brief blog post about this on
science.okfn.org if you have a moment?

Just needs to say:

  * this is happening
  * here are some quotes on what it is about and how you can get in
touch with EC
  * looks like a good opportunity to highlight the importance of open
data - and hope that people can make it

What do you think?

I've been in touch with EC who have said it would be helpful to invite
more open data in science people to the hearing...

All the best,

Jonathan

Hi Folks

I have near to zero bandwidth until later this week I'm afraid but happy to pursue this in some form in combination with others. I should be able to arrange to be free on the day.

Cheers

Town Hall meeting on Open Science at Southbank Centre


   - *Starts: *2.00pm on 08 June 2011
   - *Finishes: *4.30pm on 08 June 2011
   - *Venue: *Level 5 Function Room, Royal Festival Hall

Town Hall meeting on Open Science

Science thrives on the free and open exchange of ideas and data. But as the
web opens up access to information, scientists are now having to catch up
with rising expectations of transparency.

Scientists face demands for improved access to scientific information both
from their colleagues and from the public. They can no longer assume that
the way that they work is uninteresting to scientists in other disciplines,
bloggers or the general public. But how far should the principle of openness
extend? Could it extend to data held by private companies? Should data from
patient records be accessible? Is openness necessarily in the public
interest, especially when commercial and private individual interests are in
play?

The Royal Society invites people to Southbank Centre for a free discussion
to feed into its major new policy study on the opportunities and
uncertainties of open science: Science as a public enterprise: opening up
scientific information <http://royalsociety.org/policy/sape>.

Speakers include Sir Paul Nurse PRS, Geoffrey Boulton FRS, Sir Mark Walport
and  Philip Campbell.

Tickets are free and available by emailing
sape at royalsociety.org<science.policy at royalsociety.org>

The Society has launched a call for evidence associated with this study and
we are seeking input from academia, business, industry, Government, interest
groups and members of the public to inform this important project. We
welcome submissions as soon as possible, and before the 5 August 2011.
Information on how to make a submission is available
here<http://royalsociety.org/policy/sape/call-for-evidence>

Hi all,

The email below was sent to this list by me a while ago and there seemed
to be generally a positive view on the ideas by most of you. In order to
make some practical step to bring this forward I created an explanatory
wiki page at:

http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/science/Repeat%20and%20Reuse

Please feel free to revise and add further information and/or links to
related activities.

In future, when charing a conference or workshop I'm planning to put a
link to these Repeat & Reuse levels and ask authors to classify their
submitted papers according to these levels. Maybe you want to do the same?

Hopefully constant dripping wears the stone ;-)

Best,

S?ren

Subject: [open-science] U.S. committee seeks input on effect of copyright on
	innovation
Message-ID: <3B1076E0-3CDE-4DD5-ACF0-98886CB4827E@icommons.org>

The Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy of the US National Research Council has created the Committee on the Impact of Copyright Policy on Innovation in the Digital Era in order to evaluate and propose how to expand and improve research on the impacts of copyright policy, particularly on innovation in the digital environment. 

Because the issue of the impact of copyright is a global issue and because many of the economists and other researchers working in this field are outside the United States or unable to participate in the deliberations of the Committee in person, the Committee has created a blog to elicit their input. 

The Committee asks for suggestions of people whom it should invite to join the discussions on this blog by posting comments to this post. If possible, include a Web site or contact information for the persons you suggest.  Suggestions can be made at https://commons.georgetown.edu/blogs/copyrightnrc/2011/05/14/task-1-involving-more-people/.

The Committee is also asking for bibliographic input.  https://commons.georgetown.edu/blogs/copyrightnrc/2011/05/14/task-3-expanding-the-bibliography/.

Please share this information.  Apologies if it's a duplication.

Hi everyone,

I'm Maria Neicu (Romania) and I've recently joined the working group.?
Currently I'm researching - for my MA thesis - the politics of human enhancement in UK and The Netherlands, focusing on the popularisation of bio-technologies.?During my previous master, I collaborated with FabLab Amsterdam and Premsela for researching Open Design and fablab management, assisting the Fab6 Conference. And, to make the mix complete, my bachelor is in PR & Advertising.

Hoping I can be useful around,?

Looking forward to work together with you.

Subject: [open-science] EIM 2011 submission deadline and early registration
Message-ID: <BANLkTikbXi3st89QjSffOUYEHq6=rmCrWw@mail.gmail.com>

The deadline for paper submissions to the Environmental Information
Management (EIM) 2011 Conference has been extended.  The *new deadline for
submissions is June 5, 2011*.  Anyone who has already submitted may also
submit a revised submission by the new extended deadline, and that revised
submission will be used during peer-review.  The deadline for posters and
BoF sessions did not change (July 31, 2011).

In addition, note that the *early registration deadline is June 15, 2011* and
that substantial savings can be had by registering for the conference by
that date.

Details on both of these changes are on the conference web site:
   https://eim.ecoinformatics.org/eim2011

Contact the conference co-chairs with any questions.

Hi All

Just for completeness a note to say that I'm now attending this and booked to speak briefly on a panel on evaluation. I will naturally be pushing the necessity of access to research outputs to allow effective evaluation.

Cheers

I understood that here in Sweden this is legally impossible, as it is
considered that even anonymized data invades privacy. I think what is
behind here is that you need only so few patient characteristics (rare
disease, age, gender) to identify him (/her) anyway.

Looking forward to how this discussion continues.

 Conference and Software Exhibition, 19 Jul 2011
Message-ID: <544811C27035EF419B1CBA1C7AFE8A82083166F2C9@EXCHANGE3.ad.nottingham.ac.uk>

I'm writing to invite you to the latest event for the Repository Support Project: 'Repositories and CRIS: working smartly together. Conference and Software Exhibition<http://www.rsp.ac.uk/admin/events/edit/?id=55>' which will take place at Nottingham University Park Conference Centre on the 19th of July. This event is Free of Charge to participants and this event is open to UK and international delegates.

This event will explore the interaction of Repositories and CRIS systems and share findings of the JISC funded RePosit Project, which seeks to increase uptake of a web-based repository deposit tool embedded in a researcher-facing publications management system. Institutions involved in RePosit are University of Leeds , Keele University, Queen Mary University of London, University of Exeter and University of Plymouth, with Symplectic Ltd as a commercial partner.

To Find out more about this event and to register please visit :
http://www.rsp.ac.uk/events/repositories-and-cris-systems-working-smartly-together/

In addition to this we have invited leading suppliers of Repository software and CRIS software to take part in our Suppliers exhibition which will run alongside the conference in our refreshments area. To date we have confirmed EPrints; EQUELLA; ExLibris; Open Repository; Sherpa Services; Symplectic;  and additional Exhibitors will  be confirmed as we proceed.

This event offers an exciting opportunity to learn from the experiences of your colleagues in this increasingly important and challenging area and also speak directly to leading software suppliers all in one place!

Hello,

I am a researcher based at the University of Leeds and I've been lurking on the list for a shortwhile and catching up a bit by browsing the archive. My background is in computational geography and I am part of a collaborative effort trying to develop geographical simulation models with a focus on demography and socio-economics. The vision is to have a model of the world that we can use like a magical wizards crystal ball to understand our alternative futures and how we might make some more likely to come about than others. It could be argued to be a grand science challenge. I leave it deliberately vague and to your imaginations as to the various scales and foci of the simulation models and how they become unified. There are lots of small steps to this work and it has to be a large scale collaborative e-Science effort to make significant progress. Anyway, a major issue concerns data and the feeds of it into, around and out of the simulation models. That is why I am interested in the working group and collaborating via this list in particular. If you have similar interests, then please get in touch.

I am trying my best to make things and keep them open, but inevitably, some of the data I use is not open. I am trying to keep a distinction between the two tracks of simulation model data, the open one and the other one. Still, I appreciate that open is not a black and white issue and there are shades of grey.

Best wishes,

Andy

I use quite a significant amount of data that is not open. That still
comes with science: you do not have that kind of control of data of
which you are not the rights owner.

However, if every scientist would contribute a bit of his own data as
Open Data, it would result in a snow ball effect. It keeps building up
until closed data becomes irrelevant (and likely inferior).

This is indeed very important. This is also why services like
IsItOpenData? are important, because it must be clear what is Open and
what is not.

> Still, I appreciate that open is not a black and white issue and there are shades of grey.

I rather see everything sciency Open, but with the current academic
funding system, this is simply unrealistic, IMHO.

Dear Andrew,

This sounds very interesting indeed. Do you have any further
information about the project? I'd love to hear more about what you're
doing and what (kinds of) sources of open data you're seeking, and
what datasets you're using. I wonder whether you'd consider creating a
group on CKAN [1] for the open datasets that you're using? (As a
personal aside: this kind of project is what got me talking to OKF
Co-Founder Rufus Pollock five or six years ago...)

Also are there any synergies with things like the Living Earth
Simulator project [2]?

All the best,

Jonathan

Hi Jonathan, open-science, NeISS, DSR,

Thanks for your reply and collaboration. We share research interests :-) I'll try to be brief. The research I am doing links with a great many things which my old School of Geography, University of Leeds blog is testament to in some respects[1,2]. I am aware of the Living Earth Simulator project and trying to establish liaison with the research scientists with a view to collaboration through the NeISS project and the Digital Social Research organisation which has evolved from the National Centre for e-Social Science in the UK [3,4]. I have copied this reply to their more closed lists to keep others in the loop and spur them into liaison and replying. Sorry if that complicates things for users of the open-science list.

The vision and grand challenges are to better understand where we are, where we came from and take hold of our destiny and shape our future - wisely developing and sustaining knowledge and life as we complicate things further!

There are small steps along the way, many paths and considerable movement as far as I am aware, although I expect there is a lot going on not in the open and that I have not managed to find out about... Nonetheless, the steps I am currently taking are with GENESIS and NeISS [5,3]. For GENESIS I have been developing social simulation models, and in NeISS I have been working to develop a sustainable e-Infrastructure for supporting others to use these models at a UK national level. There are essentially two embryonic models. One is a Demographic Simulation Model (DSM) that ticks on a daily time step and deals with birth and death (and is being developed to handle residential migration). The second is more like a Traffic Simulation Model (TSM) that ticks with shorter time steps (seconds). The idea is to unify these models in due course.

In terms of data, the models are not yet pulling in a large and varied input. The DSM can be started with small amounts of even made up data, and effectively input their output which can grow in size considerably. Work is progressing towards a UK national simulation which would have around 60 million entities representing individuals in the contemporary UK population [6]. Having not developed the TSM for over a year, I am now gearing up to a organising a refactoring of this. For the TSM I have preferred using Open Street Map to represent the transport infrastructure (sadly, there are no good references for my TSM that I can point you to).

Commercial companies, like retailers, transport, ICT and media companies, as well as data companies, have data that could underpin the types of models I want to develop. Government, public service and social survey research data is also wanted to feed the (baby) simulations models. There are too many barriers that are hard to get data through for linking all our data together at present, but I believe that in general things are moving in the right direction and that safely harnessing the data to help shape our destiny for the good of all gets closer...

This may seem like a mad preachers dream of harmony over catastrophe and if you read this far, well done, but it is! Bye for now, I'll get back to developing the program...

Oh BTW, Jonathan I don't think we've met in person, but Rufus did by coincidence introduce himself once on the train and we ended up having lunch together at the e-Science institute at a Web 2.0 impacts workshop. We were not and are not alone.

Cheers,

Andy

Andy: this all looks interesting. I wonder whether you'd be willing to
write a short guest post for the OKF blog on how open data could be
valuable in doing the kind of research you're interested in doing.
E.g. I could imagine:

  * having more freely reusable data would allow more people to
undertake this kind of research
  * in the kind of complex models/simulations you're interested in
building being able to reuse and reproduce data and (parts of) models
could be very valuable
  * ...?

Anything which spoke to the specific challenges you face - and which
emphasised the value of the kind of simulation you want to do (e.g.
what kinds of problems/issues might it help to tackle) would be great.
What do you think?

All the best,

Jonathan

My background is in computational geography and I am part of a collaborative effort trying to develop geographical simulation models with a focus on demography and socio-economics. The vision is to have a model of the world that we can use like a magical wizards crystal ball to understand our alternative futures and how we might make some more likely to come about than others. It could be argued to be a grand science challenge. I leave it deliberately vague and to your imaginations as to the various scales and foci of the simulation models and how they become unified. There are lots of small steps to this work and it has to be a large scale collaborative e-Science effort to make significant progress. Anyway, a major issue concerns data and the feeds of it into, around and out of the simulation models. That is why I am interested in the working group and collaborating via this list in particular. If you have similar interests, then please get in touch.

I am trying to keep a distinction between the two tracks of simulation model data, the open one and the other one. Still, I appreciate that open is not a black and white issue and there are shades of grey.

Subject: [open-science] Marking free but not open data/linking data to
	publications
Message-ID: <0DBF2BD4A4CE9B45B8A90A65CD8338EA03B846A2@SEGBLOGR0008.springer-sbm.com>

Dear all,

 

BioMed Central is working on better tools/article formats to link
content to data in repositories (more details to follow this summer).
One part of this strategy is to mark PDFs and article full texts -on the
first page-with an 'Open data' or equivalent logo, to make it clear when
a reader lands on an article from a web or bibliographic database
search, they can get all the supporting data/the numbers reported should
be reproducible.

 

Some repositories of course use a Panton Principles complaint waiver but
many -used by many of our authors - do not, but do provide free access
to data. It would be ideal for more repositories to be fully open but
being pragmatic for the short-medium term, we perhaps need an
alternative that indicates data are freely available online, but aren't
necessarily open.

 

Has anyone thought about marking free-but-not-open data or developed a
logo/button for free-but-not-open data? I'd like to give authors who are
sharing their data some recognition, in the reference list, article
section and by stamping (effectively) their article to this effect but
within the limitations of the myriad license agreements that currently
exist for research data. Something that gives even more
recognition/credit for fully open data would be ideal, of course, but I
fear the majority would currently sit in the former category.

 

I'd welcome your thoughts.

 

Best regards,

 

Iain

Dear colleagues,


for about ten years I am active in the open access area, beginning in 
the  year 2001 when I started to work as an open access delegate at my
  university. Even though I am still working as the  open access manager 
at saarland university (Germany), I am doing a lot of  other things 
today: I am working as a science consultant and science journalist and I 
am holding a lectureship for information science in Chur (Switzerland). 
Additionally I am editing a book about several open initiatives (open 
access, open data, open collectivity, ...) and I am trying to push 
Google Germany forward to establish an open science working group within 
the google collaboratory initiative  (http://collaboratory.de/). I am 
also active in the context of alternative (open) impact metrics to 
measure scientific production.


I am very glad that OKFN allows me to be a member of this group and to 
discuss Open Science issues and projects with you!

Best regards


Ulrich Herb

Icons are something that are easy to do, but hard to get to catch on. 
We're actually reducing our use of icons at CC. See 
https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/27467 for a very recent post on 
how we're actually reducing the iconic clutter of the CC legal user 
interface.

In the short term, good metadata that is panton compliant is the best 
medicine. Lots of data can't be "open" as per definitions, for 
commercial, or privacy, or because of legacy restrictions as the data 
were gathered before people thought about open data. But if the 
conversations about that data can be open, if the data structures are 
described, if we know what kind of data it is and how we can apply for 
it, and one can use search engines to parse it...that's pretty good.
