Dear All

We have just had a fantastic Open Knowledge Conference here in Berlin, with
some excellent open science content. See the working group blog for daiily
open science roud ups:

Day 1 http://science.okfn.org/2011/07/01/open-science-okcon-day-1/
Day 2 http://science.okfn.org/2011/07/01/open-science-okcon-day-1/

There was also an Open Science Workshop day where we hacked ideas and tools
for open science and social science, which you can read about here
http://science.okfn.org/2011/07/01/pre-okcon-open-science-and-social-science-workshop/

If you are interested in more 'doing' projects involving tools and apps,
then sign up to the open-science-dev mailing list!

and thanks Jenny.

Jenny has done a great job in pulling things together and getting people
involved. okfn-science is fun. Meet new people. Find ways of changing the
world. There are lots of things which community effort makes possible. And
there are people out there who have made great progress already but don't
know about the OKF - so it's up to us to find them.

Let's keep the list active. Also I have just discovered
http://ideas.okfn.org/ where you can post ideas or find other peoples
suggestions.

Subject: [open-science] OAI7 Open Science Workshop - Vote results
Message-ID: <CAFiwkTbh01jbretHwHZqeMSFrVYw_T58z5bibgyzB_yVunzG7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello - Seems like far more than a week since OAI7 in Geneva!  I hope you
all had good journeys home.

As promised I am passing back the notes from the meeting along with the
vote.

However prior to revealing the vote results I did want to encourage you all
to join the "Open Knowledge Foundation's [Open Science] listserv" where some
very interesting discussion and events are being planned (as can be seen
below from their recent event), you can join the list by following this
link:

http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-science

I think the next couple of years is going to see the rise of Open Science in
many new and interesting ways and participating in the definition and
actions arising from those visionary definitions is going to be exciting
times.

So without further adeu, I bring you the results of the vote.  As you recall
we had four actions arising from the definitions which were:

1.) Get a group of experts to come together and agree a set of 'open
science' principles and then get research funding organisations to sign up
to those principles.

2.) Built incentives for data sharing especially interoperation
and multilingualism.

3.) Find out what motives the broad range of researchers and then bribe them
with those incentives.

4.) Change the way scientists are evaluated.

...AND THE WINNER WAS...


... WITH ELEVEN VOTES...


No.4 - Change the way scientists are evaluated!  <-- Well done Cameron
Neylon and group ;-D

The vote was close with no.3 (Find out what motives the broad range of
researchers and then bribe them with those incentives) coming in second
place with 8 votes.

No. 2 came in third with 5 votes; and

No.1 came in 4th with 3 votes.

However they are all excellent suggestions, the question is now how can we
make them happen?!

Also, as a reminder, below are the four definitions that we came up with, I
am going to put these up on the OKF Open Science listserv (Cc'd) and see
what kind of discussion we can kick off, so please join us there for further
discussion:

1.) a.) scientific data becomes huge and complex, b.) need more humans to
produce knowledge, c.) in order to link these brains we need open
communication.

2.) timely balanced and unrestricted ideas/sharing of all? available
scientific artefacts and processes

3.) a.) Science is based on based on / building on, reusing and openly
crticising the published? body of knwoledge, b.) for science to effectively
function and for society to reap the benefits from scientific endeavors it
is crucial that scientific process and scientific outputs are accessible?
and engageable, reusable and engageable with and by all (both people and
machines).

4.) Open Science is communicating research/knowledge from start to finish
without boundaries to enable a million/billion minds to participate.

Great! Was in that breakout group and memory suggests that this proposal 
began life as "Change the way *research* is evaluated" - or perhaps 
researchers, if you like.

Enjoyed the Open Science session at OAI7 very much and would like to 
take it as the model for an "Open Scholarship" session at Repository 
Fringe (in Edinburgh 3-5 August) http://www.repositoryfringe.org/

The thrust here is that many of the aspirations (open process, open 
data, mass collaboration) apply across *all* fields of scholarship and 
there is lots to learn from what the Open Science movement has already 
achieved.

I would very much like to help start, or collaborate on, an OKF project 
aimed at meeting this goal - changing the way research is assessed - 
hacking on some alt-metrics, doing a spot of web crawling scraping and 
aggregation, maybe Cameron's recent work has already spawned a body of 
free software to think about / make a start from?

Missed the first day of OKCon thus also this talk, promising:

Great job pulling all this material together Jenny.

For the Workshop we've now migrated over most the material from the
etherpads and started to add links to photos from people:

David Flanders from JISC asked me to forward this to relevant OKF lists.

He said that he would be particularly interested in any experiences
from OKF community - particularly regarding CKAN, or other open tools
that could be of value in higher education teaching or research.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

UKOLN are putting out a call for html5 case studies that illustrate
how html5 can enhance the sorts of digital content we use in further
and higher education

http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/web-focus/calls/call-201107/

?5,000 per case study - submit your proposal by 18th July. See link
above for details

Summary:
The proposals should address new features of the emerging HTML5
standards (e.g. canvas; geo-location; local storage; video; form fill;
etc.) or related standards which form part of the W3C's Open Web
Platform such as the CSS, DOM, MathML, etc.

Application areas might include, but are not restricted to benefits to
institutional Web site (e.g. SEO benefits or enriched functionality);
teaching and learning applications (course lectures delivered via
video, audio, etc.; lab notebooks); research applications (e.g.
articles, series, journals; books; table of contents; bibliography;
citation); multi-channel access; etc.

The proposals should also describe how the work was implemented and
the ways in which the new functionality was (or could be) implemented
in a real-world context of legacy browsers; possible lack of
development tools; etc.

Hope this is of interest.

Kind Regards,

David

Information Commissioner forces UEA to release data
Elizabeth Gibney

The Information Commissioner's Office has ordered the University of
East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit to disclose its CRUTEM dataset to
Oxford academic, Jonathan Jones.

Jones, a physicist at the university, used the Freedom of Information
Act to request access to the CRU archive of world temperature data,
recorded jointly with the Met Office.

The centre became embroiled a controversy known as "Climategate" in
2009, following the leaking of emails sent by the centre's academics
in November of that year.

In the ruling, made on 23 June and released on 28 June, the
commissioner Christopher Graham, gave the university one month to
deliver the data.

The UEA turned down Jones' original request in 2009, arguing that
exemptions applied because some of the data may have value as
intellectual property and others were already in the public domain.

Hi all,

I played over the past week with Kasabi, a hosting service from Talis
for RDF data, which is is free for CC-licensed data.

I wrote up my (brief) experience with it, and how I now have the
ChemPedia Substance data (crowd-sourced names of about 1000 chemical
compounds, a project from http://metamolecular.com/, available as
CCO):

Just to say that plus some further changes I've made are now pushed.

I also suggest that we move further discussion of Data Digitizer to

Hey Open Scientists,

I don't know if any of you are subscribed to the ECOLOG-L, but this thread
came up over the past few weeks and it was a pretty interesting read about
publishing code and data together with research. I'm not quite sure where to
go with this - I haven't responded - but it might be worth plugging the work
of the OKF and the Open Science list as a response? Let me know what you
think and I'll do it.

That's all,
Richard Littauer

Hi Ruvan,****

** **

Generally, publishing academic code is a good idea, but publishing real code
isn?t feasible.  If the code is small enough to publish, it is merely an
aspect of the full requirements for linguistic interaction.  But even
programs of less than a hundred thousand lines simply don?t have that much
functionality.  ****

** **

However, publishing code snippets, like the Link Grammar developers did,
would be very useful.  In the LG case, the publications included a very
clear exposition of how constraint propagation can be applied to simple
context free grammars to cover, at most, ten percent of the kind of
linguistic conversations that are required.  But the abstraction is limited
to parsing, not to linguistic interaction.  That made the complexity of the
ideas match the originality of the published procedures.  ****

** **

I agree that publishing such abstraction snippets is a good idea, but only
for appropriate levels of detail.  Beyond that, it gets unreasonably
complicated for others to learn from effectively.  ****

** **

Abstractions teach.  But full code publication merely confuses.  So it
should be a question of which papers should contain published algorithms to
demonstrate simple slices of a full system.  ****

** **

-Rich****

Sincerely,****

business        meeting

Greetings all,****

** **

I made a few remarks during the ACL 2011 business meeting in favor of the
innovation this year on allowing submissions of data and code along with
paper submissions. I suggested this is something we want to continue and
encourage, particularly for papers submitted to the empirical track at ACL
(which is the majority of papers these days) so that we might be able to
reproduce results more easily. I had some slides prepared that I didn't use,
but I've put those here that summarize part of what I said at least (I
forgot a few points, but the gist is fairly consistent I guess...):****

** **

http://www.slideshare.net/duluthted/pedersen-acl2011businessmeeting****

** **

There were quite a few comments thereafter and I took a few notes, and I
guess I thought it would be possibly useful to preserve these "for the
record" at least, since I think that discussion raised many of the common
concerns about this issue. It might also be an opportunity for folks to
follow up or at least continue thinking. ****

** **

Below are the comments, approximately in the order made....note that I'm
trying here to simply reproduce the gist of comments, and not offer any
opinion on them. I think it was great there was such an extensive
discussion, and I guess I just wanted to note that and preserve it as best I
could. If anyone feels like they have been misquoted, forgotten, or
misunderstood, please feel free to jump in and elaborate. ****

** **

0) Speaker was in support of the encouraging more submissions of code and
data, and noted that he was happy to see quite a few presentations at ACL
where code and data were being made available. ****

** **

1) Data is sometimes expensive to create (especially speech data) and
releasing it after one publication may not be in the best interests of the
creators.****

** **

2) Reviewing code is time consuming (and another concern raised during the
business meeting was reviewer overload, so this certainly fit into that
theme).****

** **

3) It is often hard or impossible for people in industrial settings to
release code - the licensing issues are sometimes very complex and would
need to be resolved before any code was submitted.****

** **

4) There could be a prize offered for the best code / best data submitted .
****

** **

5) It is hard to know how to review software.****

** **

6) Maybe software could be made available on an ACL cloud, in order to solve
some licensing concerns (especially of industry)****

** **

7) Code at submission time is very hard to anonymize - maybe we
need separate reviewers for code and data (from paper).****

** **

8) Simply releasing or submitting code isn't necessarily useful (if it is
bad code). How do we make sure the code is of high quality and/or useful?***
*

** **

9) There is a tension between having new and exciting ideas and producing
well engineered code. Put another way, there's a tension between pushing the
envelope and playing it safe. The speaker was concerned we might be moving
too far away from encouraging new ideas. ****

** **

10) Releasing code will in the end help the impact of work. If you look at
high impact work in our field, it often centers around a resource (eg Penn
Treebank). Releasing code can also help people in industry, because
sometimes publishing code is the only way that it will ever get out (eg
sentence alignment code from CL in 1993 by Gale and Church)****

** **

11) Have a retroactive prize after a few years for software systems that are
released and are proven to have some impact.****

** **

12) During the discussion of the new journal, it was mentioned that maybe
that could be a vehicle for releasing code and data. ****

** **

I'm grateful that the ACL opened up the business meeting to these kinds of
remarks, and really appreciate both the opportunity to say a few words, and
also hear all these different views. It's given me a lot to think about, and
I just wanted to pass along my notes in the hopes of encouraging others to
do the same. Keep talking. :) ****

** **

Enjoy,****

Ted

Hi Richard,

It seems to me that there are two threads going on below: one is about
submitting code and data at submission time, which I compare to
publication time; the other appears to be a pushback against
publishing full code at all.  Putting snippets or pseudocode in full
papers is done all the time; full listings in papers seems unlikely.
Arguing against making full code available, e.g. at github, etc,
doesn't make sense.  Many people will never look at it, but making it
available is always a benefit.

I wonder whether the real argument is against any requirement that
full code be made available as a condition for publication.

Hi,

I think reproducibility of results is important for science. However, with physical substances, biology, and living and thinking beings, reproducing an exact same result can be difficult if not impossible depending on the accuracy, precision and detail of the result. Digital models that input digital data can, at least in theory, be developed so that identical results can be generated provided the same input data is available and the computational requirements are met. However, the software programs and workflow need to be developed to ensure identical result replicability if that is wanted. Key to digital results replicability are packaging up the input data (or configuring a data feed such that the same input data is pulled), and likewise, packaging up the software programs and workflows (or providing links to these). Developing and providing metadata about the processing and about the computational resources used and details of the system requirement are also key for replicabilit. The more open everything is, the easier it is to provide all the details and allow replication of a result effectively at the press of a button.

In stochastic modelling and when the processing is done in a parallel and on distributed resources, results replicability can be somewhat difficult. Good simulation models should allow for results replication if required. However, often when a trend result is wanted, it can be decided to sacrifice, for computational speed, the abilty to replicate a result exacly. This can lead to not only faster processing, but the need for less metatdata.

Bye for now,

Andy

If you try to build everything into a monolith this may be true, but if the
functionality is distributed into libraries then the problem gets much
easier.  Systems such as Maven (mainly Java) and Hudson/Jenkins allow builds
of a million lines.

I don't know the background, but I do work in computational linguistics (for
chemistry). There are some reasonable libraries (GATE, OpenNLP, NLTK, etc.)
but they don't interoperate well.

A major problem is corpora and here the major publishers are extremely
uncooperative. They have consistently refused to let me and others use
academic material, and are therefore guilty of holding this part of science
back.

This is defeatism. A well defined architecture should be able to scale to
significant problems. There is a cost - it takes many person years to
develop the libraries and support tools. So I could accept that "we do not
have the money to create good code", but not that it can't be done.

I've heard this argument repeatedly. It often comes from those whose
motivation is to publish academic papers rather than distribute their code
for others. Algorithms are only one part of code - the rest is data and
integration. There are massive code bases which aren't distributable but a
great deal of scientific computation is.

Message-ID: <CABPM+wpZp8DxjQ=w6Oh=A+NFkrm-+eJ2b+J3dGFdkonEL9nAqQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

We have a couple of writing based projects on the go at the moment so in an
effort to get them well on the way and divide them between people in
manageable chunks, we'll be holding writing sprints for the next two Monday
evenings:

Monday 11th July (17:30-19:30 UTC/GMT) - Panton Principles Case Studies
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-PPcasestudies
(previous email
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2011-June/000837.html)

Monday 18th July (17:30-19:30 UTC/GMT) - Royal Society SAPE Call for
Evidence http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-RS-SAPE
(blog post
http://science.okfn.org/2011/05/19/royal-society-townhall-meeting-on-open-science/
)

If you're interested in contributing, read the background before dropping
in, add your name to the Etherpad and we'll start off on Skype to assign
tasks before shifting  to Etherpad. Left over sections will be divided up at
the end for people to take away with them - if you want to  :)

If you can't attend on the evening, please still contribute comments and
suggestions to the pads at your convenience and if any sections are left
unclaimed on the night I'll email them out to the mailing list.

Thanks very much and I look forward to writing with some of you next Monday!

Jenny

Message-ID: <CABPM+woAsKbhy4PnLKwY_i3GQ4dUWREO0PvaHv3LrMBwuenCTA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

The working group will be putting together a submission to the Royal Society
'Science as a Public Enterprise' report on the future of scientific
information publishing http://royalsociety.org/policy/sape/.

Submission must be in by 5th August, so I have set up an Etherpad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-RS-SAPE for continuous contributions and
suggest an initial drafting session via Skype and Etherpad on Monday 18th
July (sign up on the Etherpad with your Skype ID as per my email of a few
minutes ago!
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2011-July/000856.html)

You can see the full call for evidence here
http://royalsociety.org/policy/sape/call-for-evidence and I have copied the
areas it suggests we might like to comment on below (which is also on the
Etherpad for direct commenting on each section). This is by no means an
exhaustive list and the call specifically states that other areas of concern
and further suggestions should be included.

These are quite extensive areas so where possible we should try to link to
work that has already been done which we agree with rather than going over
old ground and redoing it ourselves!

Thanks and I look forward to seeing your ideas!

Jenny




Issues to address suggested in RS call:

What ethical and legal principles should govern access to research results
and data? How can ethics and law assist in simultaneously protecting and
promoting both public and private interests?

How should principles apply to:

publicly-funded research conducted in the public interest?

privately-funded research involving data collected about or from individuals
and/or organisations (e.g. clinical trials)?

research that is entirely privately-funded but with possible public
implications?

 Research or communication of data that involves the promotion of the public
interest but which might have implications from the privacy interests of
citizens?

What activities are currently under way that could improve the sharing and
communication of scientific information?

How do/should new media, including the blogosphere, change how scientists
conduct and communicate their research?

What additional challenges are there in making data usable by scientists in
the same field, scientists in other fields, ?citizen scientists? and the
general public?

What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data:

for the productivity and efficiency of scientific research?

for new sorts of science?

for public policy?

for other social benefits?

for innovation and economic growth?

for public trust in the processes of science?

 How should concerns about privacy, security and intellectual property be
balanced against the proposed benefits of openness?

What should be expected and/or required of scientists (in companies,
universities or elsewhere), research funders, regulators, scientific
publishers, research institutions, international organisations and other
bodies

CALL FOR PAPERS
1st International Workshop on Linked Science 2011 (LISC2011)
Collocated with the 10th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC2011)
October 23rd or 24th, 2011
Bonn, Germany

http://linkedscience.org/events/lisc2011

OBJECTIVES

Scientific efforts are traditionally published only as articles, with an
estimate of millions of publications worldwide per year; the growth rate
of PubMed alone is now 1 paper per minute. The validation of scientific
results requires reproducible methods, which can only be achieved if the
same data, processes, and algorithms as those used in the original
experiments were available. However, the problem is that although
publications, methods and datasets are very related, they are not always
openly accessible and interlinked. Even where data is discoverable,
accessible and assessable, significant challenges remain in the reuse of
the data, in particular facilitating the necessary correlation,
integration and synthesis of data across levels of theory, techniques
and disciplines. In the LISC 2011 (1st International Workshop on Linked
Science) we will discuss and present results of new ways of publishing,
sharing, linking, and analyzing such scientific resources motivated by
driving scientific requirements, as well as reasoning over the data to
discover interesting new links and scientific insights.

Making entities identifiable and referenceable using URIs augmented by
semantic, scientifically relevant annotations greatly facilitates access
and retrieval for data which used to be hardly accessible. This Linked
Science approach, i.e., publishing, sharing and interlinking scientific
resources and data, is of particular importance for scientific research,
where sharing is crucial for facilitating reproducibility and
collaboration within and across disciplines. This integrated process,
however, has not been established yet. Bibliographic contents are still
regarded as the main scientific product, and associated data, models and
software are either not published at all, or published in separate
places, often with no reference to the respective paper.

In the workshop we will discuss whether and how new emerging
technologies (Linked Data, and semantic technologies more generally) can
realize the vision of Linked Science. We see that this depends on their
enabling capability throughout the research process, leading up to
extended publications and data sharing environments. Our workshop aims
to address challenges related to enabling the easy creation of data
bundles---data, processes, tools, provenance and annotation---supporting
both publication and reuse of the data. Secondly, we look for tools and
methods for the easy correlation, integration and synthesis of shared
data. This problem is often found in many disciplines (including
astronomy, biology, climate change research, geosciences, cultural
heritage, etc.), as they need to span techniques, levels of theory,
scales, and disciplines. With the advent of Linked Science, it is timely
and crucial to address these identified research challenges through both
practical and formal approaches.

SUBMISSIONS

We invite two kinds of submissions:
- Research papers. These should not exceed 12 pages in length.
- Position papers. Novel ideas, experiments, and application visions
from multiple disciplines and viewpoints are a key ingredient of the
workshop. We therefore strongly encourage the submission of position
papers. Position papers should not exceed 5 pages in length.


Submissions should be formatted according to the Lecture Notes in Computer
Science guidelines for proceedings available at
http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-7-72376-0. Papers
should be submitted in PDF format. All submissions will be done
electronically via the LISC2011 web submission system.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the workshop.
Information about registration will appear soon on the ISCW2011 Web pages.


TOPICS OF INTEREST

In both categories, papers are expected in (but not restricted to) the
following topics:

- Key research life cycle challenges in enabling linked science and
proposed solution strategies
- Interrelationship of existing traditional solutions and new linked
science solutions
- Formal representations of scientific data
- Ontologies for scientific information
- Reasoning mechanisms for linking scientific datasets
- Integration of quantitative and qualitative scientific information
- Ontology-based visualization of scientific data
- Semantic similarity in science applications
- Semantic integration of crowd sourced scientific data
- Connecting scientific publications with underlying research datasets
- Provenance, quality, privacy and trust of scientific information
- Enrichment of scientific data through linking and data integration
- Semantic driven data integration
- Support for data publishing for sharing and reuse
- Case studies on linked science, i.e., astronomy, biology,
environmental and socio-economic impacts of global warming, statistics,
environmental monitoring, cultural heritage, etc.
- Barriers to the acceptance of linked science solutions and strategies
to address these
- Linked Data for
    - dissemination and archiving of research results
    - collaboration and research networks
    - research assessment
- Applications for research that build on top of Linked Data
- Legal, ethical and economic aspects of Linked Data in science

PROCEEDINGS

We expect the workshop proceedings to be published as CEUR Workshop
Proceedings (see http://ceur-ws.org<http://ceur-ws.org/>).

Hey Peter, Jack, and Andy,

I think you all make really good points. I'm not a developer or a coder, so
I don't have much to offer in the way of personal comments on them - shall I
circle your emails back into the Ecolog discussion and see if anyone
responds with interesting comments? It's good to keep Open discussions
flowing, I feel, as that's one of the main ways that advancement can happen.
Let me know.

Richard

you can repost anything you like - it's on the public website. I was writing

I think I am likely to be going to the IDCC to do a workshop on research evaluation but should be able to stay for at least some of the rest of the meeting. It's not too far for me at least.

Dear All

Just a reminder that we will be writing some Panton case studies this

Dear All

I can no longer host the working group meeting that should have been
happening tonight (I also forgot to advertise it!), so if no one objects I'm
postponing it until next Wednesday.
You can now find the minutes from last month's meeting on the blog at
http://science.okfn.org/2011/07/09/working-group-minutes-15-jun-2011/

Please especially consider attending if you were at OKCon, because it would
be great to get suggestions of people/projects/ideas of interest to the
working group that came out during the conference before they fade from our
memories!

Thanks very much, hopefully speak to you all soon!

Jenny

---Next Working Group Meeting---

When:      Wednesday 20 July at 16:30 UTC/GMT (17:30 BST)
Location:  Etherpad  http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-13Jul2011 and Skype (add
your Skype ID to the Etherpad and I'll bring you into the conference call)

Please add your name and Skype ID to the list of attendees on
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-13Jul2011
Add anything you'd like to be discussed or new ideas to the agenda (even if
you can't make it yourself, just make sure you add enough details).

-------------------
Current Agenda:
* OKCon follow up:
               Interesting people we should invite to the group.
               Projects we should follow up/assist/otherwise get involved
with.
               Ideas that came out that we could take forward.
* open-science-dev mailing list. What apps/tools/datasets do we want to see
developed?
* Review of Royal Society SAPE Submission
* Encouraging local open science groups and meet ups.
* AOB

Should we put in something for this? Perhaps Open Research Reports? Or is
that too challing for Zooniverse ?

http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/07/16/how-to-share-data-and-how-not-to/
you'll understand when you've read it (only takes half a minute). It's

Completely agreed. It should be relatively simple to tie up the apparent
file suffixes and the content. Of course files called *.dat won't do much
for us. But a *.CSV should read into a CSV library. We can probably detect
that a *.gif reads into a GIF library.

Jonathan - this looks very important. Calls like this are also a good way of
pushing us to formulate our ideas and bring together the important themes.

Is this a role for the Panton Papers? Should we try to craft these in such a
way that they are useful for policy makers? For example I am currently
interested in things like text-ming (for re-use) semantic bibliography and
citations (for more accurate assessement of scientific output), proper
simple publication of semantic data (very relevant to publishers, etc. -
perhaps not for this call).

Hi All

Just a reminder for those interested in contributing to the Royal Society
'Science as a Public Enterprise' Call for Evidence that I'll be on Skype and
Etherpad from 17:30 GMT (18:30 BST) this evening to draft out a response.
Please join me!

If the timing is inconvenient please leave any comments you would like
included on the Etherpad http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-RS-SAPE at some point
during the next week. These can be a stream of conciousness if you like -
they can always be edited :)

The date for submission is 5th August and I hope we will have something
together by the end of July.

Jenny.

I think this would be a great idea and could work well with the people at Zooniverse. It wouldn't be so different to some of their more text based projects anyway I don't think but probably different enough that it would also stretch them somewhat which would be good. It would also be interesting to see how information would need to be structured going in and out which I think would be a bit of a departure for them. They usually have one main data source which is set and then "annotated" in some form.

Hi Peter,



I just put a comment on your blog post as well.  The article is downloadable as XML, and is in the NLM Journal Article Tag Suite (JATS) format:  http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/.  On our PMC version of the article, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126798/, you can see that in the floating table view, you can cut-and-paste the table text:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3126798/table/pone-0021101-t006/.



If you open up the XML file, you will see that the table data is coded as XHTML tables.  It's better than images, but still not an ideal format for transmitting data -- all semantic content is lost.  A better format for the data in table 6, in particular, would be some XML format that captures the semantics of survey question-and-answer, such as, for example, the dbGaP DTD described in this article:  http://conferences.idealliance.org/extreme/html/2007/Tryka01/EML2007Tryka01.html.  There are probably other formats that would be even better.



IMO, it would be nice if technical article data could be captured in useful semantic forms, but it is not easy.  One huge stumbling block (again, my opinion) is that JATS is a pretty rigid XML format, and doesn't have an easy extension mechanism.  That actually just happens to be the topic of a talk that I'm about to give in a couple of weeks at Balisage, the paper for which is here:  http://jatspan.sourceforge.net/Balisage2011Paper/Bal2011malo0713.html.  But, even if that problem were solved, there would still be huge hurdles to overcome to somehow get the authors/curators of the data to get it into these forms.



Cheers!

Inferring type is sometimes not straightforward, but file names can help... If publishing data though, one can be clear about the MIME type (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type) for each different file download.

For geospatial table data and MIME types for the main geospatial mark-up language GML there is the following documentation from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC:
Tabular geospatial data for the OGC Table Joining Service (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/tjs) was expected as XML.
For the latest GML Encoding, the MIME type allows for optional parameters for "version" and "charset" (http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=37743).

I expect that something similar is wanted as well as converters for when the data is wanted in another format.

Sorry, I've rushed this message, but the main point is that the format should be unambiguous regardless of the file name.

More abstract tools that are available include:

- Sumatra, which also stores the code and the outcomes of the analysis.
http://packages.python.org/Sumatra/introduction.html
- Cacher, which provides tools for caching and distributing statistical 
analyses http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cacher/vignettes/cacher.pdf

And of course thedata.org is the easiest place to put a data set for 
long term storage, and getting a SHA-1 name is a bonus.

In terms of how to write a data paper, I encourage you to look at 
jonathan rees' short essay on "Recommendations for independent scholarly 
publication of data sets" at 
http://neurocommons.org/report/data-publication.pdf - includes links to 
some journals that have been publishing "data papers" for years.

And remember to document your workflow and present it in VisTrails too. 
http://www.vistrails.org/ - if we don't know how the researcher who 
collected the data processed it before it got into tabular form, then 
it's not very useful...

Peter: I think we should definitely aim to make the Panton Papers as
accessible as possible for non-experts and non-specialists. This
should not be at the expense of the issue and domain specific detail
that makes them valuable in understanding barriers, challenges and
opportunities to opening up scientific data.

Jenny: would you be willing to lead on drafting something on behalf of the OKF?

All: we'd also strongly encourage all open scientific data experts,
practitioners and others to consider submitting your thoughts
separately!

I've blogged about this here:

http://blog.okfn.org/2011/07/18/new-eu-consultation-on-open-access-to-scientific-information/

I'm sure this goes without saying here, but I definitely think it is
worth explicitly emphasising the value of material which is open as
per opendefinition.org and the Panton Principles!

Dear All

The drafting session yesterday evening yielded a useful outline which can
now be fleshed out and commented on. Please do take a look at
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-RS-SAPE and add your comments/ideas.

It is currently in note form and essentially documents our discussion last
night, so if anybody wants to edit points into sentences and paragraphs that
would be very useful! We will review again on 30th July to assess how much
work needs to be done before submission prior to 5th August.

Thanks a lot for everyone's help thus far :)

	London
Message-ID: <CABPM+wpc0nvpksRchoWmrQns9Bx=_BX5SuxRSzP25aRkz2o5vw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Quite a few open-sciencers are heading to Science Online London (
http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/) in September. Check out the participant
list on the Eventbrite page http://solo11.eventbrite.com/ and book one of
the few remaining tickets if you'd also like to come!

They are still accepting ideas for break out sessions - are there any ideas
we could put forward? You can check out the current suggestions here
http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/ (ones we shouldn't overlap with
pasted below signature!)

Any and all suggestions welcome, I'm hoping we can add something to their
wiki in the next couple of days as they are currently finalising the
programme.

Jenny


Current suggestions in the area of open data in science are:

*3. Can we develop something like a schema.org in science to encourage data
sharing and reuse?*
Tomi Kauppinen <http://kauppinen.net/tomi> (University of Muenster, Germany)
? see LinkedScience.org <http://linkedscience.org/> and
LODUM.de<http://lodum.de/>
? contact: tomi.kauppinen (at) uni-muenster.de
? twitter: @linkedscience <http://twitter.com/#%21/LinkedScience>
*15. Open Research Reports: a model for open access to key facts within
subscription journals.*
David Shotton (david.shotton at zoo.ox.ac.uk; @dshotton) and Tanya Gray,
Department of Zoology, University of Oxford.
People in developing countries often lack free access to academic journals,
limiting availability of biomedical information
(1<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2811%2960066-4>,
2 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736%2811%2960067-6>). Our vision for
Open Research Reports on Tropical Infectious Diseases (e.g. *Open Research
Reports on Leptospirosis*, *Open Research Reports on Malaria*) is that these
instant journals will provide open access to the key facts within the most
cited papers on tropical infectious diseases. We will demonstrate a
prototype of Open Research Reports published using WordPress. Each Open
Research Report, structured according to MIIDI <http://www.miidi.org/>, our
Minimal Information standard for reporting an Infectious Disease
Investigation, will be created by a domain expert using the MIIDI Editor,
which accesses underlying ontologies such as
IDO<http://infectiousdiseaseontology.org/>.
It will be a structured digital abstract summarizing the key facts and
conclusions contained within a single journal article, and will be published
both in human-readable form and as embedded RDFa. The Open Research Reports
concept and methodology is generic, and could be reapplied in other domains,
such as climate change. The role of Open Research Reports in education could
be massive: e.g. Open Readings in Leptospirosis, bundling Open Research
Reports with open access articles to develop free course packs for teaching
in developing countries.

*21. Research data? More than my job's worth?*
Jonathan Tedds, University of Leicester (jat26 at le.ac.uk, @jtedds)
Science online means research data online, and lots of it. Interlinked,
interweaving & interoperable ideally but more likely granular, opaque &
unattributed. The challenges around managing all this data are becoming
better recognised, witness the recently agreed Research Councils UK common
data priniciples <http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/Pages/DataPolicy.aspx>. But
as I argued in a recent Research Fortnight article (Feb
11)<http://exquisitelife.researchresearch.com/exquisite_life/2011/02/researchers-dont-fight-the-data-management-battle-alone.html>,
a key challenge is to identify who's responsible for managing all this data
and at which points during the research life cycle. Are traditional academic
structures up to the job?

> Thanks very much Jenny and everyone for an excellent draft. I don't have
major comments (I tend to work in disciplines without social aspects
(crystallography, chemistry, software). I think 20 years is too long - it's
quite possible that the primary author could be dead and you get the same
paralysis as in copyright (we have examples of 120+ year old interlibrary
loans which couldn't be released because the library couldn't be sure that
all the authors were dead. And it gives a blanket policy. Thus Imperial
College Chemistry have refused to allow ANY chemistry theses to be visible
for 5 years - there is a serious danger people might read them and find out
what people were doing. If we say "20 years" it becomes easy to legitimize
"this is only 5 years" which - IMO is unacceptable and stems from laziness
and possessiveness rather than any objective measure.

Very sorry I coun't make it and many thanks to those in different timezeones
- there is a real feeling of community.

All,

All very last minute, I know.....

Since the below, I have sussed out how to start a new EtherPad on OKFN, but anyways,....

Here's the PAD for this one.

Feel free to chime in and I'll export it's content to the Science Online wiki tomorrow.

Not off to a flying start.......

According to http://etherpad.com/ Google have acquired the service and shut it's servers down. Wasn't expecting that - news to me.

hhmm


itherpad works - yay.... OK OK

PAD STARTED

I'll be zzzz's by midnight so if we can bounce something between us, I'll export it to the #solo11 wiki at lunchtime tomorrow.


I'll see what I can up with before I fall asleep tonight.

I also saw that they closed a while ago so emailed Lou Woodley with the

 that!

Thanks Jenny,

My gut reaction told me that proposing breakout sessions in the #solo11 wiki closed a few weeks ago. 

So far, there are 23 suggestions and only 12 spaces up for grabs. 

Just DM tweeted Lou Woodley to check and she has just replied with:-





"There are still a couple of slots left if anyone wants to add 
ideas+email me to let me know. Will be announcing those we do know 
tomorrow"

I've signed into the wiki before so can edit 
something in. If we are to fling something together, we'd better act, 
like tonight. Etherpad??

Hi All

I see you're all signed up for Science Online London

Any
 ideas for a proposal from the OKF Open Data in Science Working Group? 
The breakout sessions have not yet been finalised so we have a couple of
 days to put something in.






I haven't been before so I'm not sure what sort of thing would best fit the event, all ideas welcome!

Yes - I think it should include something about OKF.

If that is fixed, then I think we should go for an Open Bibliography of Open
Science. This to be achieved by layering all CC-BY Open papers including
hybrid by systematically searching the publishers' sites. I don't like
hybrids but they are (or should be) fully OKD-compliant.

This is not too difficult to achieve. We already crawl publishers for data
and re-extracting biblio metadata shouldn't be too hard.

I'll mail my ideas here and copy to my blog

I have had the following calls (maybe people have seen it already?)

PMR ... This seems very much in OKF's area. Is there anyone intersted in
leading this? Else might it be useful to advertise OKF's role as a potential

       ENV.2012.6.5-3 Exploring opportunities for open access to primary
environmental data - FP7-ENV-2012-one-stage

       Deadline: 20 October 2011 at 17.00.00, Brussels local time

       Numerous EU funded projects have collected large amounts of data on
environmental issues. However, these mostly publicly funded data are not
always readily accessible to other researchers or to policy makers or
businesses. The Innovation Union addresses the general issue of open access
not only to publicly funded peer reviewed scientific publications launched
earlier under FP7 but also to primary data. This would enhance transparency,
credibility and efficiency of research and promote the use of data and
results for policy or business purposes. The aim of this study is to explore
in a comparative manner across environmental science disciplines the main
barriers and opportunities related to open access (free of charge online
access) to primary environmental data, notably from EU-funded projects but
also taking into account national and local data. Carried out in association
with
       European environmental research information facilities and networks,
the study should identify and document the difficulties and benefits
scientists are facing in sharing, accessing and subsequently using 'open'
primary data. The quantitative and qualitative analysis of the root causes
for existing barriers, whether behavioural, political, legal, technical or
other, should translate into an action plan of concrete future remedies, in
accordance with the provisions laid down in the INSPIRE Directive and in the
SEIS initiative. The work should be based on experience and results from
earlier EU-funded projects relevant to this issue and interact with ongoing
projects on or providing experiences with open access under the FP7
Cooperation Specific Programme.

       Funding scheme: Coordination and Support Action (supporting action)

       The requested European Union contribution per project shall not
exceed EUR 1 000 000

       Up to one proposal can be selected.

       Expected impact: Increased use of EU funded environmental results
through a solid basis for future measures in support of open access to data
in the field of environmental research.

       SiS.2012.1.3.3-1: Scientific data: open access, dissemination,
preservation and use

       Deadline: 22 February 2012 at 17:00:00 (Brussels local time)

       Topic description:
       As an environment designed to be conducive to technological, economic
and societal progress, the European Research Area must support seamless and
transparent access to, use and re-use of, and trust in scientific8 data. In
order to favour the development of this type of environment, policies
addressing the complex area of scientific data are required. Based on the
approach that "publicly funded research data should in principle be
accessible to all"9 and that "access to and dissemination of scientific
information [?] are crucial for the development of the European Research
Area"10, the present topic calls for co-ordination and support actions that
move forward policy development in the area of scientific data. Proposals
       should address open access11 to and dissemination of scientific data,
and ideally preservation and curation of scientific data and/or use and
re-use of scientific data (including intellectual property issues).

       This topic calls for proposals bringing together actors concerned
with the broader area of "open data". It aims to enable the exploration and
analysis of the relevant scientific ecosystems and legal/ethical contexts
with a view to developing an international, comprehensive framework for a
collaborative data infrastructure. Proposed actions should aim at
co-ordinating policy, research and/or dissemination activities. For example,
they may
       include the exchange and dissemination of good practices, or the
definition, organisation and management of joint or common policy
activities.

       The following actions are particularly welcome:
       - actions using a comparative approach (e.g. cross-national,
cross-disciplinary);
       - actions aiming at creating networks of one type of not-for-profit
actor or structure (e.g. funding bodies, libraries, repositories,
universities) from different EU Member States, Associated Countries or other
third countries that are interested in exchanging good practices and
exploring common policy development;
       - actions proposed by consortia representing different stakeholders
(e.g. national research funding bodies, libraries, repositories,
universities, publishers, industry users of publications).

       Where appropriate, financial aspects of continuation of activities or
structures after expiration of the grant agreement must be addressed.

       Expected impact: Support to the Commission's policies on open access
to scientific data; network-building among concerned stakeholders at the
European and international levels with a view to supporting the development
of joint or common policy agendas and activities in the area of scientific
data.

       8 The term "scientific" refers to all fields of basic and applied
research, including social sciences and the humanities.

[Copied to Open Bibliography - take care not to proliferate replies - but we
need immediate input]

Here's my idea for ScienceOnLine

"Open Science Bibliography - where can I find Open Access papers on ... ?"

Open access and Open Data are severely limited because no-one knows where to
find the objects. The proposal is to create a bibliography of Open resources
based primarily on academic publications. This can be completely mechanised
for the major publishers and is completely legal.

Pubcrawler software (or similar) crawls all the journal TOCS. It then
downloads the page for each article and examines it to see if it contains
(a) an Open Access marker (these are publisher-specific) or (b) one or more
data sets [*]. If either of these conditions hold a bibliographic entry is
created. In this way we end up with an automated bibliography of either Open
papers or papers with Open resources.

Note that we are not downloading the text or the data sets, simply recording
their existence and providing the link to them.

We have done this for several years for crystallographic data (which seems
to be impicitly agreed to be "data-and-therefore-not-copyrightable") and
have downloaded the data sets. In the present proposal we are not even doing
this.

It may be more appropriate simply to do the Open Access first

The attraction of this is that the results can go straight into CKAN
(metadata about open access) and Open Bibliography. Obviously full open
access publishers (BMC, PLoS) are straightforward. Hybrid journals (e.g.
Springer, Wiley, Elsevier, ACS) are the most immediate gain. This will
locate and publicize the Open Access papers, even when hidden in traditional
closed journals.

Even if we don't do this for SOL I'd like to think this was worth
considering

That's great. I am continuing to copy open-science as that is where JennyM
will pick this up.

If you have potential volunteers that would be great - we could do this on a
per journal (or per publisher) basis where the volunteers created the
templates to read each journal and pick out this material. That's also a
great way of getting experts involved.

JennyM - is this OK to go with ? Can wecraft something from what has been
written?

Hi All

Suggestion now added to solo2011 wiki
http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/
I've emailed one of the organisers to let them know. There are still a
couple of TBD breakout session slots so we'll see what happens!

Open Research Reports session proposed by David Shotton and Tanya Gray is
definitely happening in breakout session no. 3.

Dear all,

this Wikimedian in Residence project has quite some overlap with other
OKFN activities, and I am certainly interested in coordinating our
respective actions.

Some ideas:
(1) WMF are currently working on an open access and open data policy (cf.
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:WMF_support and
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Committee/Areas_of_interest/Open-access_policy
). Feedback from the OA and open data communities would be very
welcome.

(2) WMF-produced data released according to this policy-to-be is to be
clearly labeled for reusability, and I think even an adoption of the
Panton Principles is not out of reach. However, there is currently no
Wikipedia entry on them, so any help with setting one up would be
welcome (I started http://en.citizendium.org/wiki/Panton_Principles
last year, which could be imported, but starting from scratch may be
better). Once an entry is there in one language, expanding coverage to
other languages (especially those for which translations of the PP
already exist) should be straightforward.

(3) We could think of using a place like
http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Panton_Papers
to draft the Panton Papers.

(4) WMF are testing data repositories and collecting reports on that.
Feel free to join in:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGVqLVI0ZVBnX3kzUUxOVXFUYWJ0Y1E6MQ&ndplr=1
.

(5) The article about OKFN (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Knowledge_Foundation ) is currently
tagged for potential lack of notability, for sounding like an
advertisement, and for using keywords where phrases would be
appropriate. It is not recommended that OKFN advocates edit the
article directly, but one of my roles is to facilitate article
improvements despite potential conflicts of interest by those in the
know.

(6) What articles on open access, open data, open science and related
topics should the English Wikipedia have? I have started to sketch out
a list of such articles at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Open_Knowledge_Foundation_Germany/Open_Access_Catalogue
but it needs a lot of expansion and brushing. Once that structure is
there, existing articles need to be assessed, and missing ones written
- coordinating this is one of my core roles within the project.

(7) The Signpost - apart from covering the project in its current
issue (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2011-07-25/Wikimedian_in_Residence_interview
) - has a new section on research related to Wikimedia, this week's
issue of which has a report on the Wikipedia & Research workshop at
OKCon (cf. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2011-07-25/Recent_research
). I think that many other OKFN activities stand good chances to fit
in there as well.

(8) Another focus of the project is the re-use of suitably licensed
materials from open access/ open data/ open science sources on
Wikimedia projects. So if you see opportunities along these lines,
please use them and/ or let me know.

Thank you!

Daniel

Wikipedia but I think it's better that you do. It's well written but will
need editing.

I think it would be really exciting if we could get the Panton "OpenData"
sticker introduced Wikipedia infoboxes. It would immediately alert the world
and be a really powerful viral tool. It would also translate to DBPedia and
label that information as OKD-compliant

Seems a good idea of getting others involved

I think that using Open Bibliography to gather the references in WP would be
fantastic. I also think that if resources at the end of the bibliographic
ref were Open they could be labelled as such (or vice versa).

Hi Jo,

what about this one:
"Open Science broadly describes science carried out and communicated
in a manner which allows others to contribute, collaborate and add to
the research effort, with all kinds of data, results and protocols
made freely available at different stages of the research process."

A similar discussion is at

Daniel

I am at a small workshop which includes Michael Nielsen and I asked him this
yesterday before I knew we were going to tackle this at repofringe. Michael
is giving a series of lectures - ca 1/day over three months on the topic of
Open Science. I'll see if he has a defintion or is interested in
participating.

In case we prefer to do the drafting separate from that of Wikimedia,
I have set up a copy at
http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/OKFN2EU:OA .

I would say that the definitions, or at least visions that came out of the meeting in Geneva are as good as any. My personal position is that 'open science' is too big and diverse a church to capture with a single definition without offending at least some members of the broader community. Easier to articulate shared aims and to define more specific practices or beliefs within that.

Cheers

Cameron

I have an informal definition I sometimes use: "Open science is the idea 
that scientific knowledge of all kinds should be openly shared as early as 
is practical in the discovery process."

By scientific knowledge "of all kinds" I include journal articles, data, 
code, online software tools, questions, ideas, and speculations; anything 
which can be considered knowledge.

The "as is practical" clause is included because very often there are 
other factors (legal, ethical, social, etc) that must be considered. 
This can get extremely complex, and requires, in my opinion, extended 
discussion.

A nice feature of the above informal definition is that it makes it clear 
that when the journal system was developed in the 17th and 18th centuries 
it was an excellent example of open science.  The journals are perhaps the 
most open system for the dissemination of knowledge that can be 
constructed --- if you're working with 17th century technology.  But, of 
course, today we can do a lot better.

Incidentally, I'm certainly not trying to make any claim to any 
originality in my informal definition, nor insist that others use the same 
notion!  But since Peter asked, I thought I'd reply in the hope that it's 
helpful.

Cheers,

Michael

I can definitely agree with that!  This is part of why I'm not comfortable 
making a more formal definition of the term.  I especially like Cameron's 
last sentence!

We drafted these several years ago for the ESOF forum, and they've 
served us well at CC :-)

http://sciencecommons.org/resources/readingroom/principles-for-open-science/

But they're principles, not a definition. Definitions in my opinion work 
well inside defined domains with clear borders (software, cultural 
works) and less well in sprawls like science. Science doesn't even 
really exist; there are instead a variety of disciplines that practice 
variations on the scientific method. The invisible colleges of those 
disciplines are often very different from one another, on top of 
institutional differences, on top of national differences, and so on. 
One definition to rule them all will be unlikely to scale.

An old friend once noted after I spent a solid half-hour monopolizing a 
dinner conversation on this topic, "dude, so your point is that science 
is complicated."

Started a list http://okfnpad.org/rfringe11-open-scholarship

Glad of the responses. Perhaps we are looking for a declaration rather than a definition. To say "we are doing Open Scholarship because we are doing X and Y". Then wouldnt have to be too exhaustive or qualified...

Not sure when is the session planned for? Am otherwise engaged on the 4th most of the day :/

Meaning Scholarship as a whole... There have to be some common sets of aims...
