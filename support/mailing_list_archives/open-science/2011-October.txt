Subject: [open-science] Fwd: Invitation to the public: European Group on
 Ethics Roundtable on ICT (Information and Computer Technologies) on 15th

Hi all,

I recently received this invitation to the European Group on Ethics
Roundtable on ICT, but won't be able to attend the event. I have no idea
what will be discussed there, maybe data privacy/security, another and
from my perspective even more interesting aspect would be openness,
reusability of ICT research along the lines of the Panton [1] or
Repeat&Reuse Principles [2].

In case one of you guys want to go to the event (and bring these topics
to the table) I attach the invitation to this email.

Best,

S?ren

Hi S?ren,

thanks, 
one interesting formal aspect seems to be that you can use the registration formuntil 4 November 
forgiving your recommendation independently of whether you will actually participate in the local meeting on 15 Nov.

"Which main ethics issues do you think the EGE should address in their Opinion on'Ethical aspects of ICT'?"

agree:

If you (and/or someone else) finally decides to go we could also have a
Skype call before the meeting to brainstorm and discuss a little how to
position the OKFN ideas there best. Let me know once you fixed the date
and I can initiate a doodle poll for the Skype call.

Message-ID: <CABPM+wrSYb6UpDemRxeA-zW1cc_5r7QPoYQy288WHr=X87kipw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

The working group are involved in organising a hackathon as part of the
Semantic Web for the Life Sciences (SWAT4LS) conference in London this
December and we'd like to encourage those of you with some web/app/software
development skills to participate!

While the theme of the hackathon is broad, covering the generation of
semantic web tools for the life sciences, a particular area of interest for
several members of the working group is the development of open research
reports using open bibliographic data from PubMedCentral and crowdsourced
summaries of disease research. Suggestions for initial topics are malaria
and cancer.

This event is kindly sponsored by JISC through their DevSCI project

When: Tuesday 6 December, evening and Wednesday 7 December 2011, all day
Where: ULU, London (TBC)
Website and registration: h
ttp://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/devcsi/life-sciences-hackdays/index.html<http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/devcsi/life-sciences-hackdays/index.html>

Participants are recommended to discuss ideas via the open-science list
(although we may move this to open-science-dev if things get too techy) so
please do follow and contribute to the conversation even if you can't attend
the event. There may be opportunities to participate remotely so please
email me if you're interested in doing that.

I hope several of you can make it!

Jenny

Thanks, Jonathan, for forwarding this to the list.

Of course, the success of the book is important to me for purely personal 
reasons.

But the main reason I wrote the book is that I believe it's vital that 
open science become a mainstream issue in our society. Writing a book 
aimed at a general audience seemed to be the best way I could help achieve 
that goal.  I believed this strongly enough that I gave up my tenured job 
to write the book.

I know open science is a goal close to the heart of the people on this
list, and so I'm hoping you can help get the word out about the book
to colleagues, students, and the public.

I've blogged more about the book (with links) here:

http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/reinventing-discovery/

Best wishes,

Michael

hi Michael,

Great news, Michael, my congrats! 
thank you very much for sticking your head out here,
... so today I am just in time for my Chapter1-review before the complete work starts to be shipped

hi all,
just finished my essay on Chapter 1 of Michael's book this morning, 
let me add re my closing question that I do of course appreciate what Michael says in his blog post 
http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/reinventing-discovery/ re accessibility and planning for the commons

let me share the following thoughts with you, 
cheers, Claudia

2011-10-20, by Claudia Koltzenburg

on Michael Nielsen: Reinventing Discovery, Chapter 1

?Anyone in the world?: Who is s/he? Where and how is s/he situated?

In the first Chapter of his book Reinventing Discovery (starts shipping 21 Oct 2011), Michael Nielsen argues that the impact of ?the new online tools? is indeed ?broad-ranging? and that ?many scientists have missed or underestimated? this, ?being so focused on their own specialty? that in their lack of appreciation these scientists are ?likesurfers at the beach who are so intent on watching the waves crash and recede that they?re missing the rise of the tide.? So Nielsen, it seems to me, sets out in this book to describe, and maybe analyze, the location (beach), the surfing (sport), what drives the waves (rules?), and what in this setting is the tide?s function (broad-ranging change?).Possibly, Nielsen will also address the climate issues at this beach (the weather, the ground and the background scenery, and is there any waste lying around?), and maybe he will also pose questions like: Who are these people (intent on wind surfing or wave riding)? Are they a group? Why can they afford being at this beach in the first place? What is their equipment like, who was it produced by and at what income level, where do these ?tools? come from and how did they get to this beach?

Nielsen?s first Chapter that has been made available ahead of ?publication?, provides interesting food for thought and I am looking forward to read what is to come. This introductory part contains quite afew descriptions of an online culture of scientific collaboration that seem convincing to me because these descriptions link to my own experience of how at least some of the barriers to fruitful debate can be done away with successfully. Nielsen predicts that by using online tools ?improvements to the way discoveries are made? can effectively be put into practice and that such improvements ?are more important than any single discovery.? (p. 3) However, speaking of discoveries, ?What a discovery that would be ? a system that did not shut out?. (V. Woolf, Entry for 2 October 1932, A Writer?s Diary)

?Anyone in the world may freely download the genetic map?, Nielsen says in his description of how GenBank services are meant to work. With view to the ?anyone? issue in particular, I seek to find out how MichaelNielsen, in the course of the book, will introduce to the reader the philosophic and developmental rationale behind the general claim for needing something ?more?, ?better? and ?faster? ? for ?the advancement of science? (p. 9). Putting this claim to an immediate test ? as to where the surfers? equipment comes from ? mightn?t there have been a better and faster way to make Nielsen newest book officially accessible for anyone in the world, too?

Hi All

Just a note to say that Peter Murray Rust and I are currently sitting in the
Computer History Museum in Mountain View, CA at the Open Science Summit
http://opensciencesummit.com/
I'll be blogging at science.okfn.org and attempting to tweet interesting
snippets through the conference (@jenny_molloy) so do follow, send any
queries and if you're here yourself, definitely seek us out for a chat!

If anyone wants to do the same between 1-3pm, Peter and I are presenting the
concept of Open Research Reports at some point during that session :)

On twitter, people seem to be converging on the hashtag #oss2011.  Great 
coverage so far of Victoria Stodden's talk -- thanks to everyone who's 
there and tweeting!

I am in the same session, by the way. Would be good if we could keep
this email channel on in case something goes wrong with Skype.

Dear Peter,

I'm even more outraged after seeing the slides, than I was after
reading your blog posts.  Not only you show no data for assertion
"closed access means people die" (anecdotal evidence is not an
evidence - instead of formulating a hypothesis, you claim  "I don?t
think anyone can deny the truth of that conclusion."), but you imply
absolutely false connection between mortality rates in very poor
countries and lack of access to primary research literature.

This is very wrong. Majority of maternal mortality rate in Bangladesh
(see your last slide) is attributed to child marriage, lack of female
education and lack of skilled birth attendants. Access to scholarly
literature is absolutely irrelevant in such case. You'd need to
improve the standard of living and the quality of education first.

Please stop flashing images of poor people in your open foo talks.
You're harming the credibility of open science community.

PS

I did not say it was the major cause of mortality, but it is a contributor,
including in the rich west. After talking with people who run patient groups
there is anecdotal evidence that many patients cannot get access to the
literature they want and that diagnoses are in error because of that.

I shall take steps to create bodies of anecdotal evidence to support my
assertion.

I can supply the same amount of anecdotal evidence showing how access
to information is harfmul in case of patients, starting from effects
of Wakefield's MMR paper and ending with plenty of stories from local
doctors. Additionally, rate of correct diagnoses can be improved (by
75% as some studies suggest) by adopting clinical decision support
systems (users of such systems do not need access to primary
literature). You haven't tested neither your nor null hypothesis.

Nope, these things are heavily connected. Ability to effectively use
primary research literature increases with the standards of living
(access to equipment) and level of education. OA makes a lot of sense
for Western countries, a bit of sense for transitioning countries
(such as Poland) and almost no sense for poor countries where the
major issue is no access to clean water.

Indeed. You've harmed already mine, but it's an anecdotal evidence.

If we are talking about open access to scholarly publications please believe
me that people in universities and research institutions in developing
countries do have computers and internet. this is one of the examples of a
Kenyan researcher speaking about open access: Prof. Mary Abukutsa-Onyango
discusses the importance of open access for research from Kenya and other
African countries <http://www.vimeo.com/10169351> (http://vimeo.com/10169351)
and I can share more evidences like this.

Many thanks for this. The video is exactly what Jenny and I need for a clip.
It's no coincidence that it was created by Leslie Chan who is one of the
group of us who dreamt up Open Research Reports.

Yes, OA is absolutely critical.

There is actually an immediate urgency (which has suddenly arisen) _ Jenny
and I and other have to make a video within 24 hours. (Of course that's not
the end of the story). We want to bolt together clips from OSS video with
bits of Graham Steel presenting patientsLikeMe and Leslie's clip that Iryna
posted. The video will be 5 mins long and present particularly what I and
OKF can do NOW so there is a concentration on the December Hackathon. I'll
explain the context later.

Except that OA and OER are a bit different things. Here's quote from
Peter's email from January this year (first and last sentence,
please):

"Pragmatically I think we separate scholarly articles ("papers") from
other efforts such as Teaching/Learning materials, and theses.

Many of us in OKF want to see Open Theses but the ground rules are
different (the copyright is normally the student's) and the challenge
is with the universities to address this rather than primary and
secondary publishers. So just as important but a different type of
activity."

Let me explain again - I'm pointing out that it's very important to
pay attention to the messages this community is spreading.

OA (understood as open access to primary literature) is very
important, especially in developing countries, but if there's no
healthcare infrastructure to apply the cutting-edge knowledge, OA
becomes almost irrelevant in the healthcare (while being crucial in
research). Peter's claim is false (or at least unsupported by any data
in case of developed countries).

OER, which is somehow wider term because it might (but doesn't have
to) include scholarly articles as well, is a different process and a
means for knowledge dissemination. OER in principle saves lives,
there's no question about it.

Mixing OA and OER creates a problem. These are different processes,
they have different stakeholders, there are different streams of money
in them. And that's not my invention - this is what this community
have thought in one of the discussions almost a year ago.

When mixing OA and OER in the messages, this community risks being
ridiculed, because it appears that we have no idea what we are
fighting for. If the audience are scientists, we'll be ignored.

Additionally, some of us, like me, rely on the leverage of this
community because we don't have enough leverage on our own in our
local communities to push things forward. A bit of responsibility for
OKFN global image would a nice addition to keeping the messages
correct and clear.

I'm sorry, I cannot explain it any simpler than that.
If you still disagree with me, just discard the message and let's
forget the whole discussion.

useful for all of us.

If you haven't sat through the whole video , please do: Prof. Mary
Abukutsa-Onyango discusses the importance of open access for research from
Kenya and other African countries <http://www.vimeo.com/10169351> (
http://vimeo.com/10169351)

In this, SHE, not I,  begs for Open Access in Kenya. Note more generally
that "healthcare" covers a great deal more than expensive machinery and
drugs and that information is a key component in every country in the world.
If countries are asking for OA then we must support them totally.

I differentiate between scientific statements and political ones. When I
said and continue to assert
"closed access means people die"
that is a political statement.  I hope that we can quantify it in some cases
- certainly the patient advocates such as Graham Steel and Gilles Frydman
can give us serious anecdotal evidence of the frequency of this problem. You
do not need a null hypothesis and a clinical or sociological investigation
to assert the truth of this statement. I do not intend to publish it in a
scientific paper. I am prepared to clarify it to
"closed access means a significant number of people die"
 - indeed I understood from your earlier mail that you also believe it to be
true.

Your second concern is whether the (political) action I have taken is
responsible. That is a political judgment, and part of the value of this and
other lists is that we can refine our ideas. The two main questions are:
"what do we want to achieve"
and
"how do we want to achieve it".
The OA movement suffers in that it has failed to formulate the first and is
split on the second. I believe that the only useful form of Open Access is
CC-BY (either by Gold publishing or other means) whereas Stevan Harnad
believes that Green OA is a necessary and achievable first objective. We
disagree profoundly and I suspect that we shall always disagree - again this
is a political statement.

The OKF has a wide range of members and adherents and has spent considerable
time discussing what it is. (In OKCon Berlin 2011 we had a whole day on our
"organizational DNA"). The OKF is very much about action, both in
formulating goals (such as the Open Knowledge Definition and the Panton
Principles) and building practical steps to achieve them (Open software to
support the creation and spread of open Knowledge content). To that end I
help to develop, say, Open Bibliography and the associated protocols and
software.

Open Research Reports is another such activity. We have prototyped tools for
collecting Open knowledge in science, initially about disease, and creating
events and communities to fill them. The presentation at Mountain View was
primarily to present and promote ORR and the upcoming hackathon in
December/London. We'd be delighted for you and anyone else to attend - and
the idea is intended to be trivially clonable and expansible so that people
can replicate it eslewhere and elsewhen.

I see no reason why the idea should not be adopted anywhere. For example I
am familiar with Open Source Drug Discovery in India, where I know there are
participants carrying out computational chemistry (my own field) who do this
on mobiles even though they have no road to their front door. This is why
all my code is Open Source; I am flattered that they are interested in
adopting it and other modules of the Open Source chemistry community.

This group will almost certainly be starved of the closed access scientific
literature.  I would also expect that they will rapidly produce stuff that
we find of value and we should be very careful of making judgments.

I have another quote from my colleague in Malawi - Kondwani Wella, College
Librarian, Kamuzu College of Nursing, University of Malawi: "Malawi has a
stock of research output in a variety of forms, including technical reports
and journal articles that could have influenced policy decisions and
stimulated further research. However, these documents are locked up in the
offices, libraries and resource centres of the country?s higher education
institutions. Consequently, important policy decisions have been made
without considering the available evidence. For example, Malawi has been
successful in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Although reports of the
success stories are available, these have not been widely disseminated
within and outside the country. Lives may possibly be involved; for example,
the research on prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV in
Blantyre clinics could be equally valid in Lilongwe or Chiradzulu ? if it
were accessible." I think his statement is relevant and is presented in the
context of what is going on in his country.

Hi, everyone,


My name is Andrew Ramsey. I'm writing on behalf of Open Science
Kentucky<http://opensciencekentucky.blogspot.com/>(OSK), a relatively
new organization dedicated to establishing greater
participation in open science among researchers and the public. Thanks for
having us here.


OSK started as collective disillusionment among medical students at the
University of Louisville School of Medicine who felt that the evidence-based
practices we were learning merely shifted our curriculum from one flawed
paradigm to another. Bad, opaque, interest-driven science continues to be
the predominant information medium, despite the shift to practice-by-numbers
medicine. Now, however, we physicians more complacently practice, weilding
bad science unquestioningly because we can remind ourselves we are under the
aegis of evidence. Unfortunately, in medicine, our careless application of
evidence-based principles kills people.


We have enjoyed reading web commentary from thought leaders in the open
science movement, many of whom are participants on this message board. We
defer to you for your remarkable insight! However, we noted that finding
resources related to open science was remarkably difficult when searching
directly for it. It is thus very unlikely the average scientist will realize
an open science epiphany while looking for other things.


To shift the paradigm to open science, open science will certainly need to
become a ubiquitous term, emerging within frank discussions within secondary
through doctorate level educational settings, overlying decisions about
where to submit every new manuscript, becoming the deciding factor in
selecting candidates for employment and projects for grant-funding. Open
science must become as appealing as classical science. To do so, it must be
visible. At OSK, we've dedicated ourselves to making the widespread
discussion of open science plausible.


We have a variety of projects we're working on, each of which will benefit
greatly from your sage counsel and assistance. I will share more information
on these projects later.


For now, thanks again for having us. Looking forward to learning from
everyone. Cheers!


Andrew Ramsey

For the record, I agree with Pawel.  It's one thing to be provocative,
quite another to make your fellow-travelers' lives more difficult. 
Appeals to the heart via wrenching images of poverty are not suitable
for conversations about scholarly publishing: they simply make it easier
for opponents to muddy the waters.

Peter, you have done more than most in the service of Open Foo, and from
time to time the same enthusiasm that powers your achievements has
carried you over the line and put you in a position where you've had to
retract, adjust or apologize for various statements.  I've never
considered that a bad thing and I've always admired your willingness to
own up to error.  I think this is one of those times.  You've simply
made statements that you can't support, and coming from someone of your
stature that really does not help the cause.

best,

Bill.

If there is a general feeling that I have overstepped limits I will take
that on board. For the record (and I own any error in this - I am not making
excuses) the initial 5-6 slides were not mine and were presented at Science
Online in London and not by me. But having used them I take responsibility.
I suspect that the context and perhpas my own delivery may have changed the
impression.

So - there are at least two different things - the use of the images and my
statements and possibly the combination.

As you say I listen to people and I am prepared to change my behaviour. This
was an event of public record - I will look at it again with your two
comments.

While the case could be more rigorously presented for open access to
biomedical research saving lives, anyone working in global health or public
health in the developing world should know the case is strong.

Granted that Elsevier, Springer, et al. admit their long term commercial
motives for participating in WHO's HINARI programme and all of
Research4Life, these and similar initiatives (such as INASP) have saved
lives by providing free or lower cost access to thousands of journals in
more than 100 developing nations. Even though they exclude painfully poor
nations such as India from HINARI, Elsevier themselves are quick to trot it
out as life saving. For example
http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/authored_newsitem.cws_home/companynews05_02017
 includes

*"Dr. Arun Neopane of Nepal offered readers the opportunity to experience
not only how Research4Life has benefited his work as a paediatrician, but
also how it has supported him in his role as Editor-in-Chief of the Journal
of Nepal Paediatric Society and General Secretary of Nepal Association of
Medical Editors (NAME). ?HINARI has changed the perspective of research in
our country. It has saved so much of the precious time of our doctors, by
making them more learned. And it has also saved many lives?, states Dr. Arun
Neopane...."*

Quotes like these are not hard to find. *"This project has probably had the
most impact of any WHO project since the Oral Rehydration Therapy" said Dr.
Philip Njemanze, chairman of the International Institutes of Advanced
Research and Training at the Chidicon Medical Center in Imo State, Nigeria
...*on page 89, World report on knowledge for better health, WHO, 2004.

Extending access to the scholarly poor in India, Pakistan, Egypt, and other
nations who lack HINARI or INASP, or to the scholarly poor in all nations,
would undoubtedly save more lives. The publishers do not do so, they
acknowledge, because there is money to be made. Peter is not out of line in
pointing out poignantly what many already admit.

Aside: I am waiting right now in a conference room in Seattle, where I will
personally beg Bill Gates to lean on publishers, policies, and to generally
join the chorus for open access. Anyone who knows me personally should
cringe at the thought of me begging Gates, but access to research, data, and
code are critical for progress in biomedical research (and all fields) and
having learnt so much about global health, Gates may agree. PMR is spot on
in my opinion, leveraging strong and compelling arguments for open access
from amalgam fields such as global health, education, climate research. BG

Hi all,

I had a reaction similar (though perhaps not as strong) to Pawel's when I saw this statement.

It seems to me that there are two somewhat (but not completely) independent issues:  1, is the statement correct and supported by evidence?, and 2, is it good PR?

My reaction, when I saw it, was that it is not really proveable, because it involves a counterfactual of huge proportions.  We can't know what the world would be like if all the literature right now were freely and openly available.  There are thousands, or even millions, of confounding factors.  The entire world would be a different place.  People would still be dying, but how to attribute the causes?  It's not enough to trot out anecdotal evidence of specific cases where closed access caused harm.  As Pawel mentioned, opponents could just as easily trot out evidence of open access causing harm.  That's a very strong argument, I think, and one that I hear all the time - about the need to control quality and reduce fraud.  I'm not saying I agree that it's right, but just that it's a powerful argument.

As for the PR point, I also agree with Pawel that it makes the open movement too easy to ridicule.  Take the climate change debate, for example.  Conservatives are so effective at destroying the message by ridiculing the messengers, that they have completely decimated any possibility for action.  Note that I'm emphatically not saying that it's the messengers' fault at all - but just that we should be very mindful of the effectiveness of these kinds of tactics.

Cheers!

This is great Heather,

There is actually an immediate urgency (which has suddenly arisen) _ Jenny and I and other have to make a video within 24 hours. (Of course that's not the end of the story). We want to bolt together clips from OSS video with bits of Graham Steel presenting patientsLikeMe and Leslie's clip that Iryna posted. The video will be 5 mins long and present particularly what I and OKF can do NOW so there is a concentration on the December Hackathon. I'll explain the context later.

I should make it very clear that I was only speaking for myself, not on
behalf of the OKF or other Open movements.

I believe that we are better off talking about *an ethical spectrum of
"public goods"* that are served by open access... Based in the ethos of
science and the now commonly accepted notion that *access to knowledge is a
fundamental human right* [SEE for ex. The Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, Article 19: "Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and
expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without
interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through
any media and regardless of frontiers." ]  Democracy is founded in
transparent, open access to knowledge resources...

IMO... This spectrum includes: human health and public health, agrarian and
agricultural health, conservation and biodiversity, education and science, *
non-destructive* technology...

As noted by others, the risks of exaggerated assertions of risks/benefits
are diminished credibility and violation of the fundamental principle that
policy and decisions be clearly based in evidence...

Hm, sorry for the confusion everyone. You're right, I should probably
clarify my question. My question is specifically is that if OKFN membership
or OKFN proper is /not/ "that radical", what groups are? I fully understand
and value that Peter's original statements were opinions and that this has
experienced an unnecessary explosion; I am probably only adding to the
problem with my question.

I suppose another issue is the expressed opinion ("open access is net
better") vs. "has anyone studied whether or not inaccessible research would
actually save lives" which isn't so much an issue of extremism but rather an
issue of practicality, of whether you are presenting an opinion or fact.
However, I think we are all in agreement that there are benefits of open
access here; the issue of opinion vs. fact is not an issue of extremism but
rather an issue of natural and healthy discourse; still, it seems that the
general consensus opinion in this group might not be aligned with Peter's?
There is nothing wrong with this mis-alignment except that it opens the door
to a question like mine- "okay, then out of curiosity are there any groups
where the opinions are exactly aligned with Peter's, or even more extreme?".

So just some further clarification: (1) no, OKFN/open-science (this group)
is not too radical for my personal tastes/interests, (2) OKFN is certainly
something I wish to continue to support (even if it is not the most radical
extremist set of beliefs I can possibly imagine), and (3) yes I would very
much like to know the names of other groups that are more radical and/or
extreme that I may pursue. I am not particularly interested in making forks,
but I would very much enjoy knowing of alternatives.

hope this helps, sorry for the noise on the list everyone

@Peter, I saw you a few times at the Open Science Summit this year but I
didn't have a chance to say hello. Maybe next year.

Thanks very much Alma. I notice the author advocates the following:

*"If every single biomedical research article were made freely available and
published under a Creative Commons license, all articles could be collected
together in a single open access information space. The literature could
then be seamlessly integrated with important databases, such as gene or
protein databases, and it could be more easily searched and mined. The
result would be the discovery of new scientific medical knowledge. We now
have machines that can scan research papers and find linkages among them
that no human could have discovered...For this to happen, however, papers
must be held in an open access repository and not remain hidden behind
publishers? authentication
systems.?88"<http://www.hhrjournal.org/index.php/hhr/article/viewArticle/20/88#refs9>
*
ORRs aim to provide that single space for the currently available literature
on a particular disease and eventually semantic tools which could allow the
kind of searches mentioned above. They won't get there for a while, but
you've got to start somewhere.

In addition to the other replies I thought I should also try to address
Pawel's request for data and hard evidence on the idea that open access
saves lives, but as you'll see below it's difficult and most organisations
including those quoted by Brian and Alma use testimonials/anecdotal evidence
as their main source of support in this.

Peter's assertion is similar to that made by Healthcare Information For all
(HIFA2015 http://www.hifa2015.org/ ) whose website leads with 'People are
dying for lack of knowledge'. This campaign has a community of over 1800
healthcare organisations (many national/worldwide medical bodies including
the British Medical Association, Cochrane Collaboration, WHO African
Regional Office Library - full list here
http://www.hifa2015.org/support/#supporting-organisations) that are happy to
endorse the message, although they also admit that there is a lack of data
to substantiate and quantify that claim:
"A challenge to advocacy is the limited availability of hard evidence such
as case studies and other data demonstrating in quantitative terms the
difference that the effective provision of healthcare information can make
to health outcomes, quality of care, training or other relevant result"
(pg.43
http://www.hifa2015.org/wp-content/uploads/HIFA2015-Evaluation-Report-Final.pdf
 )

HIFA focus on information provision at all levels, not just access to the
primary literature, but the testimonials on their website and personal
correspondence between those involved in ORRs and the HIFA2015 Coordinator
Dr Neil Pakenham Walsh indicate that a major element of the global
healthcare knowledge system is increasing the availability and usability of
primary research.

A review on the information needs of healthcare workers in developing
countries http://www.human-resources-health.com/content/7/1/30 references a
study:
To test the hypothesis that there was variation between and within
developing countries in the proposed management of a patient with hospital
acquired pneumonia, and that part of the variation can be explained by the
sources of evidence used (
http://www.jclinepi.com/article/S0895-4356(99)00231-0/abstract)
Which I suspect is the kind of evidence you would like to see, but seems to
be one of the only studies of its kind. The abstract concludes "Textbooks
were the commonest form of information source, and access to a library,
textbooks and journals were statistically significantly associated with
appropriate choice of investigations, but not treatment. Access to local
antibiotic sensitivities was associated with appropriate initial treatment
choice. Improving access to information in the literature and to local data
may increase the practice of evidence-based medicine in the developing
world."
Not the strongest support but it's the only peer reviewed publication I
could find addressing a question of that sort.

Although we are focusing on open primary research literature and expert
annotation/summaries of the most highly cited papers via the web form
generated by David Shotton and Tanya Gray, the next stage would involve
annotation by the broader health community that would meet the needs of
specific user groups, including lay summaries and possibly translations
(which Pawel says would have impact  -
http://www.pawelszczesny.org/2011/10/25/open-access-means-people-die/). ORRs

How this knowledge becomes accessible to healthcare workers as open
educational resources, particularly those without access to computers and
the internet is a considerable challenge, but the primary targets in
developing countries would be doctors, researchers and students in the first
instance for whom the primary literature is a direct educational resource.

You are absolutely right that it is not an underlying cause of the majority
of maternal mortality, but the quality of medical education is vital in
ensuring that correct maternal care is provided where skilled birth
attendants are available, which includes access to up to date techniques and
information, at least to those training midwives and birth attendants.

Again, there is no hard evidence to be had on this but comments from the
HIFA network include
?There is lack of a system to update nurses/midwives in private and public
practice about the development in Maternal and Child Health were by when
challenged are not in position to clarify and support safe motherhood. (No
access to technology, refresher courses, literature, support supervision of
their facilities etc)?
David Muwonge, Uganda (October 2008 - Registered nurse, working with Naminya
community outreach and nursing home)

There is also a lack of access to literature for medical students, who thus
may be entering practise with information from out of date text books:
http://www.hifa2015.org/knowledge-base/healthcare-providers/information-needs-of-health-students-in-low-income-countries/

ORRs aren't aiming to address any of these wider problems, but may offer a
resource to reach people who can disseminate that knowledge to primary
healthcare workers who may not have or desire access to primary papers (we
are aware that translation from academic literature to practice is a huge
barrier to the potential effectiveness of increased access but HINARI gives
a good example with Hepatitis E "The key outreach is done by the Uganda
Gastroenterology Society...It gathers information from HINARI and transmits
it to the country through radios, healthcare workers and any person who
handles blood as they are most exposed to the virus."
http://www.research4life.org/casestudies_4_aids.html ). While the healthcare
use case has many challenges that must be overcome, availablility of primary
literature to researchers has more immediate benefits. Barbara Aronson
addresses the issue well:

"Will improved online access have an effect on health in low-income
countries? It is probably impossible to show a direct connection either
between the lack of access to information and poor health or between
improved access to information and improved health. There are many other
reasons why health in these countries is poor and will not improve quickly.
These include poor health services infrastructure, poor nutrition, lack of
clean water, and poor sanitation, as well as war, drought, and political
corruption. Most global health and medical research remains focused on the
problems of wealthy nations. But low-income countries also have medical
schools and universities. They have researchers and research institutes that
carry out essential work on local problems and government offices that try
to set effective policies. Warren Stevens of the Medical Research Council
Laboratories in the Gambia has noted that intellectual isolation represents
an important hindrance to the development of world-class researchers in
African countries. Access to timely, relevant, high-quality scientific
information represents a substantial gain for the researchers, students,
teachers, and policymakers in low-income countries. Can this be called
anything but progress?"
Improving Online Access to Medical Information for Low-Income
Countries, Barbara
Aronson, N Engl J Med 2004; 350:966-968

Although it can't be concretely backed up with data, the idea that open
access saves lives is not confined to HIFA, As Brian Glanz pointed out -
quotes to that effect are not hard to find:
HINARI has collected case studies of the impact that free access has on
healthcare and devlopment and 'saving lives', 'improving quality of life'
are mentioned multiple times:
http://www.research4life.org/casestudies_2_diarrhea.html (Educating people
in good hygiene practise)
http://www.research4life.org/casestudies_4_aids.html (Prescribing correct
antiretrovirals and monitoring)
http://www.research4life.org/casestudies_1_watersheds.html (Developing
filters and storage systems for drinking water)
During our talk, Peter explained why he feels 'free' is not sufficient and
open access is better, but easy access at all is the point

SOROS Open Society Institute had in it's 2006 Annual Report the article:
Open Access to Scientific Research?Sharing Information, Saving Lives
They also have case studies of harmful medical decisions being made due to
lack of access to the full text medical literature
http://www.soros.org/initiatives/information/focus/access/articles_publications/articles/openaccess_20070419

Virginia Barbour, Chief Editor of PLoS Medicine states of Springers decision
to offer free access to E.coli research during the recent outbreak in
Europe:
"Springer knows how important open-access publication is - they own Biomed
Central, a large group of open-access journals. By acknowledging that open
access to the literature can save perhaps 10s or 100s of lives in this
outbreak, they surely can't deny that opening access to the entire medical
and scientific literature has the potential to save many millions of lives."
(HIFA forum - 3 Jun Press release: Springer offers free access to research
articles on E. coli bacteria
http://dgroups.org/ViewDiscussion.aspx?c=e95b885f-14b0-4452-a819-06cf188ee6b0&i=38f192cf-bd2e-4afb-8710-620a538dfb1e
)

Therefore, I'm not sure the general message that open access to biomedical
literature can save lives, and conversely a lack of it can cause preventable
deaths through incorrect or outdated treatment is that radical within the
global health community.

As above, there is an intersection in health research addressing local
problems, which one would think could lead to better local policy and
improved healthcare, although again there is no data to offer. I'm glad you
brought up the lack of evidence and that others on the list have joined in
the discussion of how relevant open access is to developing countries,
hopefully this will be the focus of more research in the near future.

Leaving aside developing countries as a use case for ORRs, patient advocates
who have been consulted on ORRs believe Peter's statement to be the case for
some diseases in the developed world. There are no doubt also anecdotal
examples of the opposite, and a separate debate would be the scientific
literacy of the general population and their ability to interpret the
literature, but misinformation and poor science reporting by the media is
far more dangerous than access to the primary literature, which would at
least give those with the inclination a chance to check the facts and the
place of findings within the broader field of study. In the case of MMR, the
paper was closed access and not a single study I've seen suggests that
parents based decisions on anything in the scientific literature, they were
listening to the media and, where they trusted them, healthcare
professionals. This would have been the case regardless of the open or
closed nature of the publication - the vast majority of the population will
not access the primary literature even if openly available - but the fact
remains that some people want to, can make good use of it and there are
cases where they have, which as Peter mentions he will try to compile with
the help of patient groups.

I appreciate your point about the nature of anecdotal evidence, but in the
cases supporting the idea that open access can save lives, there is a direct
link between access to the primary literature and changes in clinical
decisions/treatment being beneficial, or closed access being harmful e.g.
changing practices innappropriately due to only having access to an abstract
as in Alma's source http://www.hhrjournal.org/index.php/hhr/article/view/20/88
. <http://www.hhrjournal.org/index.php/hhr/article/view/20/88>I'd be
interested to know if the evidence from doctors that you mention is patients
making harmful decisions due to information from the media/quack
websites/other sources of information (as was the case with MMR) or directly
from the literature.

Sorry this ended up being so long, it's been a useful exercise :)

Hi Adam

Thanks for the interest and glad you're here. Expect some robust debate but also the good insights that comes out of it. I wanted to speak specifically to your point about a lack of a good site to find things online.

Building on some ideas of Heather Piwowar's I've been knocking around some ideas on what we might do about this. It seems that we need three things. A site that pulls together and/or indexes all the best content on open research from around the web as well as aims to organise it so that people can find what they're looking for. A means of getting that content indexed so that it appears when people aren't looking for it but perhaps should be (i.e. PubMed, WoK etc etc). And finally a way to motivate people to take the ideas that aren't quite yet formed, or aren't quite yet as well laid out as they could be, and turn them into well finished pieces.

The answer to this for me is something that is a website that looks from one angle like a journal (contains peer reviewed content with DOIs, the whole deal) but that would also bring more general material in from the wider web, like a community aggregation website. There is a model for this in PLoS Hubs but that doesn't provide the whole answer (indexing etc).

We've got some ideas on how to do this and possible angles on how to make it happen but I'm wondering whether people feel that this would be a good step. The bottom line is it would be quite a lot of work, both to get it off the ground, but also to sustain it so it would need strong support to be viable.

Cheers

Cameron

Bad, opaque, interest-driven science continues to be the predominant information medium, despite the shift to practice-by-numbers medicine. Now, however, we physicians more complacently practice, weilding bad science unquestioningly because we can remind ourselves we are under the aegis of evidence. Unfortunately, in medicine, our careless application of evidence-based principles kills people.

Ok, to comment/summarize/clarify things:

1. Peter mentioned that the statement in question was of political
nature. I think this is very important as it explains couple of
things, especially some disagreements of whether this statement is
"true enough" (more on that below). It also explains my strong
reaction, as I had read it as "scientist-to-scientist" communication,
instead of "activist-to-scientist". It is an important lesson (also
for me) to evaluate assumptions about which mode of communication is
in use at a particular time.

2. It seems we have no enough data to support the scientific statement
"OA saves lives", although we might have enough anecdotal evidence to
back up an equivalent political statement. "Knowledge dissemination
saves lives" is an easy one for a comparison.

3. I can imagine that strong political statement of "OA saves lives"
might be potentially useful in all but "scientist-to-scientist" modes
(at least that's what I understand from some of your emails), however
heavily relying on that might actually undermine actions of those
interested in "more than free" scholarly literature. Two days ago,
attending one of OA Week events, I heard Elsevier executive saying
that they will move to "Universal Access" (equivalent of "free" but
not "open") as soon as data shows it is financially sustainable (so
far hey had ca. 2% level of participation in "author-pays" model). It
is not hard to imagine situation in which large publishers actually
fuel "OA saves lifes" meme, only to "solve" the problem by giving free
access to the literature instead of text-mining-level access. In some
ways it is already happening. For that reason, and considering this
outside of "backed by data" issue, it might not be the best idea to
endorse this statement at all. But that's just an opinion.

4. Jenny asked about sources used by patients making harmful decisions
in Poland. Well, in at least two cases I heard about patients delaying
cancer therapy on the basis of information found in scientific
literature (they came with reprints of articles to a doctor). I hear
it happens more often, but didn't ask for more details. Also, as far
as I know, some pratictioners of EDTA chelation therapy for
cardiovascular disease in Poland are giving patients reprints of a
paper presenting results of one of the earliest (and one of the only
two favourable) randomized controlled trials. These are probably
reasons some physicians here loudly state: "yes to knowledge
dissemination, but no to OA" (controlled lay summaries instead of
work-in-progress in full research papers), however I have no idea how
representative these voices are. The overall scale of the effect of
scientific literature is very hard to quantify here (beyond anecdotal
evidence), because the literature is in English. In English namespace
at least you can get a feeling of a scale: one of the most popular
sites within memespace of "elites are pushing global depopulation by
vaccines, gmo, cancer and diabetes" (and a popular site in general -
within 4000 most visited websites in the world, 19k Facebook likes,
several thousands Tweets pointing to the main site, etc.) cites a few
hundreds PLoS articles (and very few articles from closed access
journals), usually in alarmist tone and in support of the main meme.
Interestingly, the site welcomed open access warmly, as it helps them
to "challenge corrupt medical system", as they say.

Given multiple levels of OA and the fact that OA doesn't have to be an
integral element of knowledge dissemination strategies (a number of
people are arguing about that), choice of PR tactics isn't an easy
one. My personal preferences, however, are to keep the image of the
community as scientific as it is right now, and if there's a need for
more "activist" tone (in a sense of making strong political
statements), the preferred solutions would be to either make it clear
about the type of the message, or fork it outside of the community
(either to some more "radical" group if one is found by Brian, or to
"activist" branch of OKF if there's one).

PS

PS. The collection of links, quotes and source articles summarized by
Jenny should be published in some form (at least a blog post - it's
too valuable to keep it closed inside mailing list). It would improve
"learnability" of the subject, as suggested by Egon Willighagen on
related FF thread.

Backing up claims with solid data is indeed very important. But I
would just like to reiterate here that many scientific fields work
with anecdotal evidence on a daily basis. This does not just include
social sciences like cultural anthropology, but also biology, where
about every second paper is anecdotal (bold claim by a chemist :).

And to just add my anecdotal evidence. My mother died of cancer two
years ago, purely based on misinterpretation of symptoms. Were those
symptoms properly recognized, she would have still lived. Health care
even in western countries is not taking advantage of all knowledge
there is in the field... something is failing, and Open Access is an
rather important role here.

So, it's up to the field scientist to run the experiment and show PMRs
claim is wrong... (or not).

For broadly this reason I see Peter's assertion, although blunt, as
the null hypothesis.  *Of course* we should expect a restriction on
information flow to cost lives.  Can we show that it does not?

I am enjoying this thoughtful discussion, which is a very healthy (and perhaps overdue) one to have in an organization that is at the nexus of science and policy advocacy.  I too was initially taken aback by the messaging of the OSS presentation, though upon reflection it's not clear to me that this group should aim for a politically neutral message.

That said, a variety of evidence may be brought to bear on a policy issue: experimental, anecdota, theoretical, etc, and rational interpretation of that evidence need not be 'political' even though subjectivity may be more difficult to avoid when the evidence is fragmentary, as in this instance.  

We have mostly been discussing problems that arise through access to results from one or a small number of studies at a time.  I wonder if it is not possible to make an evidence-based case that computer-aided knowledge extraction from the literature is less efficient than it could be due to access restrictions generally and text-mining restrictions specifically.  

Then, to the extent that more efficient scientific discovery leads to improved human welfare, it is reasonable to go one step further and make the case that open access is one possible means of improving health-care, global stewardship, efficient allocation of R&D funds, and other public policy objectives.  

It would only get political, in my book, when you start to assign relative *value* to that benefit compared to the benefits of toll-access and restrictions on text-mining. 

But if we consider the case solely on the grounds of the efficiency of scientific discovery, then the data-informed approach to this policy would be to also consider to what extent changing the way publishers currently fund and restrict access to journals would have unintended negative effects on knowledge discovery (and dissemination) in the public interest.

An apolitical weighing of evidence of this nature seems to be within reach, even if precisely quantifying the net overall improvement in healthcare outcomes, etc, from OA to the currently closed literature would be tremendously difficult.

Message-ID: <CAGaH0=3VMb5f4gSdKgtyjncsXRaWQkuoSFxANi_OadPocHyn1A@mail.gmail.com>

Economist review of "Human decision-making: Not so smart now" The father of
behavioural economics considers the feeble human brain [Oct 29th 2011]
Review of *Thinking, Fast and Slow.* By Daniel Kahneman. *Farrar, Straus &
Giroux; 352 pages; $30. Allen Lane; ?25.*

The review reads:   *"He also shows that it is more threatening to say that
a disease kills
'1,286 in every 10,000 people?, than to say it kills ?24.14% of the
population',
even though the second mention is twice as deadly. Vivid language often
overrides basic arithmetic."

*A propos our recent consideration of the distinction between the
"political" ("rhetorical"?) and "scientific" statements.
I wonder to what degree rhetoric impacts the presentation and acceptance of
scientific results?

Seems our most fundamental problem is firm grounding in evidence [data] --
as defined by logical validity with respect
to well-formed hypotheses?
