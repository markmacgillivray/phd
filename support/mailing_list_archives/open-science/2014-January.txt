Subject: [open-science] Is anyone attending the RECODE workshop
Message-ID: <CABOTVX91gg1Bhh98yw3Y=FRU1E+1cxwhzvAkpH2b6eGWTyeH6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I was wondering if anyone from the OKF community was planning to attend the
RECODE workshop in Geneva on 14 Jan:
http://recodeproject.eu/events/recode-workshops/. It's called 'Perspectives
in understanding open access to research data ? infrastructure and
technology challenges'

I'd loved to have gone - but sadly I'm already busy that day.

If anyone is going, I'd love it if you could let me know was gets said -
either as an email to the open-science and open-access lists, or possibly a
blog somewhere?

Best wishes,
Michelle

CFP: 11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org    
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Program Chairs:
- Claudia d'Amato (Department of Computer Science, University of Bari, IT)
- Fabien Gandon (Wimmics, Inria, I3S, CNRS, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, FR)

ESWC is a A rank conference according to CORE classification and a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and technology innovations related to the Semantic Web. The 11th edition of ESWC will take place from May 25th, 2014 to May 29th, 2014 in Anissaras, Crete, Greece. Besides a main focus on advances in Semantic Web research and technologies, ESWC 2014 is seeking to broaden its attention to span other relevant research areas in which Web semantics plays an important role.

The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a Web of knowledge and services in which the semantics of content is made explicit and content is linked to both other content and services. This arrangement of knowledge-based functionalities is weaving together a large network of human knowledge, and making this knowledge machine-processable to support intelligent behaviour by machines. Additionally, it supports novel applications allowing content from heterogeneous sources to be combined in unforeseen ways and support enhanced matching between users needs, software functionalities and online content.

Creating such an interlinked Web of knowledge which bridges between heterogeneous content and services requires collaboration between several computer science domains. Also, within this hybrid space that the Web has become, where humans and software interact in a complex manner, fundamentally requires an inter-disciplinary approach to find novel solutions to the problems generated.    

ESWC 2014 will feature twelve thematic research tracks (see below) and an in-use and industrial track. Submissions of interdisciplinary research papers, covering more than one thematic track, are also encouraged. In addition, the in-use and industrial track will provide an opportunity for dialogue and discussion on industrial applications, tools, deployment experiences, case studies and usage analysis.

Submitted papers should describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation. We strongly encourage and appreciate the submission of papers incorporating links to data sets and other material used for evaluation as well as to live demos and software source code.


We therefore encourage submissions addressing several conference research topics. However, each paper should be associated with at least one of the topics of the conference. The main research topics this year are:
- Vocabularies, Schemas, Ontologies;
- Reasoning;
- Linked Open Data;
- Social Web;
- Web Science;
- Data Management, Big data, Scalability;
- Natural Language Processing;
- Information Retrieval;
- Machine Learning;
- Mobile Web;
- Sensors;
- Streams;
- Services, processes, and cloud computing.

Additional special research topics this year are:
- Cognition and Semantic Web;
- Policies, Rights, Governance;
- Semantic multimedia web.


*Important Dates*

Abstract submission: Wednesday 8th January 2014 (sharp) - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Full-paper submission: Monday 13th January 2014 (sharp) - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Authors' Rebuttals: Wednesday 19th-Friday 21 Feb 2014
Acceptance notifications: Wednesday 26 February 2014
Camera-ready papers: Monday 10th of March 2014


*Submission  Information*

ESWC2014 welcomes the submission of original research and application papers dealing with all aspects of representing and using semantics on the Web. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications papers. The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

This year three of the best papers presented at the conference will have the opportunity to submit an extended version to a special issue of the journal "Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability, Applicability" (IOS Press).

Papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be formatted according to the information for LNCS authors. Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format. Papers that exceed 15 pages or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be automatically rejected without a review. Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission - details of this process will be given on the conference Web page at the time of acceptance. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference. More information about the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) are available on the Springer LNCS Web site (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors).

Submissions and reviewing will be supported by the EasyChair system: https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=eswc2014

==== Final Call for PhD Symposium ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/phd-symposium

** Deadline: 
**     Monday 13th January 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time


11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
PhD Symposium Chairs:
- Steffen Staab (Institute for Web Science and Technologies - WeST, University of Koblenz-Landau, DE)
- Mathieu d'Aquin (Knowledge Media Institute, The Open University, UK)

The ESWC 2014 PhD Symposium is a chance for PhD students working in all areas of Semantic Web research to present their work, meet with peers and experienced researchers, obtain feedback and learn from each other's experiences. It aims at helping future researchers in building up the skills and confidence required to conduct and promote their research, as well as providing them with an opportunity to attend one of the most important research conferences on the Semantic Web.
 
The ESWC PhD Symposium will give to students the opportunity to:
1. Learn from a mentor: Established researchers and PhD student advisors will provide direct feedback. Each selected student will be assigned a member of the programme committee with whom they will interact on the revision of the paper and the preparation of the presentation.
2. Learn about research in general: Doing good research goes beyond writing a good paper; it includes perspectives on research as an endeavour and a career. Besides the presentations, coffee breaks and the PhD Symposium lunch will be used to exchange ideas and ask questions about all aspects of conducting a PhD and a research career in general.
3. Learn by constructive criticism: Thinking and writing about strengths and weaknesses of other research contributions shapes your own research capabilities.  As a participant to the PhD symposium, you will be expected to also review submissions from others, allowing you to juxtapose and learn from convergence and divergence of opinions.
4. Learn by presenting: Accepted contributions will be presented in the PhD symposium. All accepted contributions will also appear at the general poster session of ESWC. Students' posters will be presented alongside posters and demonstrations of the main conference.
 
Submissions will be considered from two different categories depending on the advancement into the PhD:
- Early Stage PhD: For students who may have identified the main research problem they want to address, the relevant literature, and are building their research methodology, but might not yet have obtained significant results, or only preliminary ones.
- Late Stage PhD: For students who have already defined their approach (even if incompletely) and obtained significant results (e.g., that might already have been published).
These categories do not affect the chances of being selected. They will however be taken into account by reviewers in their feedback, and in the length and format of the presentation. The organisers might decide to move a submission from one category to the other, if they think it is justified.


*Submission Information*

PhD students in all areas of Semantic Web research are invited to submit papers having 5 to 10 pages describing their PhD research, in the PDF format following the LNCS template (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0) Submissions should be sent using the PhD Symposium submission system (https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014ps), through which participants will be also asked to decide on the category of their submission and to write a paragraph regarding their motivation for participating in the ESWC PhD Symposium.
 
Submissions should follow the following template of sections:
 
1. Introduction/Motivation
Give a general introduction to the domain/area/topic and indication of its importance/impact in Semantic Web research or other domains.

2. State of the Art
Describe existing work in the area, work focusing on the same/similar problems or that might be useful to realising your PhD.  

3. Problem Statement and Contributions
Based on motivation and state of the art, formulate the problem you intend to solve, and how you intend to contribute to Semantic Web research. This section should include a clear formulation of one (or very few) research hypothesis (what you will validate through your methodology, approach and evaluation) and the research questions that need to be answered. Late Stage PhD submissions should focus on contributions to such a hypothesis.

4. Research Methodology and Approach
Describe the research methodology you will apply in your research, including the different steps from the formulation of your research questions to answering them. Also describe the approach you are taking (or you intend to take for Early Stage PhD submissions) to instantiate the research methodology, hence contributing to solve the problem described in Section 3 and confirm or reject your hypothesis. Discuss how this approach is innovative and novel, and how it is (might be) implemented.

5. Preliminary or Intermediate Results
In a full conference paper, the approach would be fully described (in section 4) and fully evaluated (in section 6). Being at an intermediate stage, you should report here about the results achieved up to now in applying your approach that might not yet be sufficient for a full evaluation. .  

6. Evaluation Plan
Describe your evaluation plan, which is the way you intend to validate your hypothesis, your results, and the value of your approach. For Early Stage PhD submissions, this might be only partially defined, and details might be ommited. For Late Stage PhD submissions, you might have partial evaluation results.

7.Conclusion  
Describe how your results will or might impact research or the world at large.


*Important dates*
 
Submission deadline: 13th January 2014
Notification: 10th February 2014
Revised version of submission to mentor: 24th February 2014
Final version: 10th March 2014
Draft presentation to mentor: 12th May 2014

 on Jan 21, 15:00 CET
Message-ID: <52D1215D.9070706@informatik.uni-leipzig.de>

Dear all,

On January 21st at 15:00 we are organizing a hangout introducing
SlideWiki.org:

https://plus.google.com/events/cd6gqh3qk66i0636crtofivka6c

SlideWiki.org is a platform for OpenCourseWare authoring and publishing.
Similar as Wikipedia allows the collaborative authoring of encyclopedic
texts, GitHub of sourceode or OpenStreetMaps of maps, SlideWiki enables
communities to create comprehensive open educational resources.
SlideWiki is open-source software and all content in SlideWiki is Open
Knowledge. In this hangout we want to introduce SlideWiki's rich feature
set and explain how SlideWiki can be used for educational projects and
teaching.

We aim to make SlideWiki an official OKF Germany project and would also
be excited to see other OKF projects (such as School of Data and/or the
various handbooks on open data, journalism etc.) using SlideWiki for
OpenCourseWare.

Would be great if you joined the hangout. Meanwhile feel free to play
with SlideWiki (http://SlideWiki.org) and to look at the documentation
(http://slidewiki.org/documentation/).

On behalf of the SlideWiki team,

S?ren

Subject: [open-science] Transforming Peer Review Bibliography
Message-ID: <52D33D30.2030809@digital-scholarship.com>

Digital Scholarship has released the Transforming Peer
Review Bibliography, which includes selected
English-language articles that are useful in understanding
significant transformations to the peer review process.

http://digital-scholarship.org/tpr/tpr.htm

It is concerned with major changes to peer review, such as
open peer review (excluding just revealing the identity of
traditional peer reviewers) and post-publication review.

Most sources have been published from January 2010 through
December 2012; however, a limited number of earlier key
sources are also included. The bibliography includes links
to freely available versions of included works. If such
versions are unavailable, italicized links to the
publishers' descriptions are provided.

Subject: [open-science] [Science Lab] Launching a second pilot on code
	review in science
Message-ID: <13F0D98F-2354-444F-BDEC-5320F7BACB71@mozillafoundation.org>

We are launching a second pilot study of code review in science this February, and want you to take part. The main findings of our first study were:

everyone involved thought it could be useful, but
a drive-by review after work is ?finished? isn?t.
This time, we?re pairing experienced mentors with small groups of scientists who are ready to start giving code review a try. The mentor will do a few reviews at the outset to get things rolling, but after that will act as a coach to help the scientists learn how to do reviews themselves.

Our goal is to find out whether code review will have the same benefits in science as it does in open source and commercial software development. More importantly, though, we want to see whether integrating code review into the research cycle will spur scientists to work in more open, more collaborative ways in general. Once researchers are used to reading one another?s code, will they be more likely to re-use it as well? Will adoption of code review encourage them to use more open tools in writing their papers, and help them see how to make data more reusable as well?

If you would like to take part (either as a mentor or as a team being mentored), please get in touch ? we?d be grateful for your help.

	Jan 18:00 UTC
Message-ID: <CABPM+wpb-O1jSW8KxfTJkQO9PtZVP7NjsXV3eSnyqEM6i5A=9w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Thank you to those of you who got in touch following my email late last
year to offer your help coordinating the open science group and starting
new local groups. Below is an update on the next steps and a further
invitation to get involved if you would like to do so.

*Local Groups*

   - We are excited to be exploring new activities in Italy, Romania,
   India, Germany and China!
   - Do get in touch if you'd like to act as an open science ambassador in
   your region and begin to form a local group.
   - Watch this space for an upgrade to the working group website to make
   it much easier to find and view local groups and activities around open
   science. If you're a whizz with javascript and would like to help out with
   this we would love to hear from you :)

*Working Group Coordinators*

   - The email copied below this one listed several roles for which it
   would be great to find volunteers. Thanks to all those who responded so
   far! If you would be happy to assist but haven't responded yet, get in
   touch or add your name and interests to the spreadsheet [1]
<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtV3tIqIu0UZdHg0NDFkRy1POWhwQ2tsOEdTa2kyNlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0>
   - Those who are interested in coordination are welcome to join a
call on *Monday
   20 January 18:00 UTC* (agenda and details at [2]), if you can't make it,
   do comment either before or after the meeting and feel free to get in touch
   with me. We are likely to run another call in the near future for those in
   different timezones.
   - Look out for an update after this meeting on coordination going
   forward and introductions from the new coordinator team!


Thanks again and I'm really looking forward to working with you through
2014 :)

Message-ID: <52DAD899.2090703@scinoptica.com>

Dear lists,

perhaps this might be of interest: Yesterday an anthology on Open 
Science was published: "Opening Science - The Evolving Guide on How the 
Internet is Changing Research, Collaboration and Scholarly Publishing". 
It has been edited by S?nke Bartling from the German Cancer Research 
Center in Heidelberg and  Sascha Friesike, researcher at the Alexander 
von Humboldt Institute in Berlin. The anthology knows four 
manifestations: it is available as a printed book,  as an Open Access 
e-Book or PDF collection under a CC BY-NC license, and as an editable 
living document via Github. for further information please visit:

Sounds useful.

One comment. CC-NC is not Open Access under BOAI- and OKD- definitions. I'd
urge you to make the book CC-BY. If there are reasons that you can't do
this, please drop the term "Open Access" and call it "free-of-charge".
CC-NC forbids many forms of redistribution and re-use

I will try to join the call tomorrow. I like to see (and participate
in) a NL local group, but cannot coordinate that at this moment...

Discrimination based on field of endeavour I thought was the problem.

Even if some copyright exceptions allow use in situations in which the
license didn't *intend* to allow such use, the license still discriminates
based on the type of activity ("field of endeavour") - doesn't allow
commercial use.

The legal ability to use something for commercial reasons and being told
not to by the license are two separate things, though obviously related.
Being told not to by the license makes it a non-open license according to
OKD.

This isn't to say non-commercial licenses are evil in all situations, I
can't pass that judgement. But if you use a non-commercial clause, you
certainly can't call the thing "open access" - it's accessible to some part
of the population, but it is not "open". Like this anthology (which by the
way looks like it's quite nice).

Greetings,
Emanuil

I don't think it does. From the CC-BY licence:
"No additional restrictions ? You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits."
A paywall that everybody can just walk around is no more than an invitation to make a payment, a donation. Which a potential user can ignore. 
NC is a control mechanism. It has no place in a knowledge environment that is publicly funded for the benefit of society at large.

I guess what it boils down to (for me) is that what matters is how people
perceive CC-BY. If they think it "makes my article free to read (and to
text mine) [and open access]", then that's what will happen - eventually -
regardless of how somebody else interprets the license to suit a perhaps
ageing business model. They'll just think RightsLink is plain wrong to do
what they do.

It is of no significance that RightsLink can use the OA articles to profit,
as the resulting ill will will force the creation of more ... accurate
alternatives.

Say a medical start-up mines all of the medical papers they can get their
hands on in order to obtain information that aids new research, and then
sells that information back to medical departments? I'm sure opinion will
be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and
convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience
or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of
business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best
sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to
support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is
important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.
However, it's my understanding that CC-BY-NC would prevent this kind of
scenario. And as I said, not all scholars would be against this kind of
scenario. But they aren't going to think about it when picking CC-BY-NC
because "I don't want RightsLink to sell my article".

Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go
- we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to
exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual
mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful
every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all
research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like
those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as
the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most
scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)

There's an entirely separate issue that's usually conflated with the
published work itself - the metadata about the work. Where is it located,
what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that
info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally
this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the
originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though
the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)

Again, even if we somehow created this data from scratch (scraping and so
on), then how would we publish it? CC-BY - no problems for downstream
applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an
attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much.
If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could
they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of
CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?
DOAJ kind of illustrates this in fact, since their data is under CC-BY-SA,
which means that if I were to combine their dataset with other data, I'd
have to release the result under CC-BY-SA, which may hurt MY downstream
data consumers in ways I can't imagine.

So yes, CC-BY comes with no strings attached for downstream usage because
that hurts the flow of information and makes people deal with unintended
(sometimes to the point of being silly) scenarios when they should be
focussing on running their business or otherwise enhancing society.

Additionally, attaching restrictions to data use is practically useless
unless you can back your copyright infringement claims up. People serious
about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their
experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't
look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain
the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not.
People just take what they need when it's published, and we should
recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in
some cases even -SA).

The reason we can't go and download all the papers from publishers'
websites like Aaron Swartz did is not because their incredible restrictive
website ToS says so, it's because they have enough cash to back up their
ToS. And maybe (depending on personal values) because whoever does this
would be concerned they'd hurt real people (they do work at publishing
companies ..).

So attaching restrictions on downstream use just:
1. kills little innovative side projects people think up, because they
actually paid attention to the licensing and it forbade them from using the
data, and they were afraid enough of copyright law / potential bad
reputation not to go ahead
2. kills big serious innovative projects like companies, because older more
established ones use the restrictions they put on downstream usage of their
data against them

#2 is sometimes acceptable, we can't tell businesses not to compete or give
all their data away! But I'll certainly think more of a business which
publishes at least some good useful data with no strings attached, or even
everything sans business intelligence over the data (& tries to compete on
other vectors, not exclusive data access).

Greetings,
Emanuil

So in your scenario, Heather, CC-BY-NC secures that there won't be the possibility of a fast lane at all. How can that be better?

For example, imagine that Elsevier buys out or is bought by an Internet Service Provider and net neutrality is legal in country X.

Hi Heather,

The 'requirement' is that what one calls open access IS truly open access. Any licence that covers open access works should reflect that. Of the CC-licences, only CC-BY does. NC is an impediment to use scientific works to their full extent, and thereby renders works under an NC licence unsuitable to the label 'open access'. It may be called 'free', 'gratis', etc., but calling works 'open access' when under an NC licence makes the very term 'open access' ambiguous and confusing to the point of being useless. I'm reaching the point where I am considering using only the terms 'CC-BY-Access' or 'BOAI-compliant OA' when referring to what used to be simply 'open access'.

Of course, free, gratis, access is not in itself a 'bad' thing, certainly compared with paywall-access, but is not as good as it could be if it were truly BOAI-compliant OA, and not sufficient for optimum usage in science.

Hi Heather,

The 'requirement' is that what one calls open access IS truly open access. Any licence that covers open access works should reflect that. Of the CC-licences, only CC-BY does. NC is an impediment to use scientific works to their full extent, and thereby renders works under an NC licence unsuitable to the label 'open access'. It may be called 'free', 'gratis', etc., but calling works 'open access' when under an NC licence makes the very term 'open access' ambiguous and confusing to the point of being useless. I'm reaching the point where I am considering using only the terms 'CC-BY-Access' or 'BOAI-compliant OA' when referring to what used to be simply 'open access'.

Of course, free, gratis, access is not in itself a 'bad' thing, certainly compared with paywall-access, but is not as good as it could be if it were truly BOAI-compliant OA, and not sufficient for optimum usage in science.

Best,

Jan

I've got nothing to add to Mark's description of Cottage Labs. I'm a
software developer, not a currently active scholar. I'd rather that all
scholars and the public could access each other's work. I'd also like to
see good business and not-for-profit initiatives building on top of that
work and making it even easier to access, relate, analyse and derive value
from (and drive research forward). I want all the text, all the data and
all the metadata open (as per the Open Definition ideally) so that this
kind of innovation can develop, coming both from scholars themselves and
others who wish to help scholarship.

The GPL is a great example. The GPL is copyleft, i.e. -SA. Turned out,
though, that companies can't always share all their code for competitive
reasons.
"Amazing! Sharing is forever encouraged and *required*!", said those who
liked GPL.
"Err..", said the software developer who received tens of requests for dual
licensing from companies wanting to use his GPL code in great commercial
applications that he would have allowed without asking. They couldn't
open-source their core products though.
"I just wanted to share my code and I was told this is how you do open
source by a friend. I don't really want to deal with all this admin work.
Rejecting them all is bad too, I like some of them a lot. Maybe I need to
change my license."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- Now dual-licensed under MIT ( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) and GPL

"Hm, we don't like this. You should have just left them in the mud if they
wouldn't share their enhancements to the code." - said supporters of the
GPL.
"Well, actually they did share some *other* code and other stuff, because
they felt compelled to and it has so many benefits, like attracting
talented developers. Also it got really bad really quickly - I never
realised other open source projects would be prevented from using my code
and now I'm really angry!"
- "Huh? How come?", asked the GPL supporters.
- "Well if they've picked MIT to be commercially friendly or because they
didn't care about forcing sharing, they can't use the GPL. It's copyleft,
remember? They have to release a GPL version of their code if they use any
of mine! I never meant to force other developers to pick a license for
their work!"
- "Well, they should make this little bit of effort and join the true
sharing community and make sure their work is forever shareable.", retorted
GPL supporters.
- "I'm angry now I'm even spending time on this issue. I wanted to code and
share my code. And discuss this with others. Not discuss licenses. I am no
longer participating in this discussion."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- No longer licensed under the GPL. If you want to use the GPL code for
some odd reason, go back to the version which had it. Beware, no support of
any kind will be offered for old versions. Use the latest version to report
any problems or bugs.

And so, except in some exceptional cases, nowadays the majority of open
source code is not GPL, but one of the other ones listed here under Popular
Licenses: http://opensource.org/licenses , all created to serve different
needs, but none containing blanket restrictions like -NC and -SA. (There
are still quite a few GPL projects.)

Obviously papers are not code and one wouldn't necessarily mix & match text
from papers to produce new papers. However, the lessons learned from trying
to apply downstream restrictions still hold true. (And besides, who am I to
say there isn't a truly good and innovative idea to be had in mix &
matching scholarly papers.) Newly minted software developers like me
usually know this: Do. not. restrict. usage. of. your. open. source. code.
without exceedingly good narrow reasons forced by a very specific situation
on you. You will end up hurting causes and projects you like, and will not
stop those who only wish to take and not contribute back.

I feel that there's such a big push for CC-BY because people are concerned
about fragmenting the scholarly sector in superficial legal ways. The
cracks take a lot of time and frustration to close, and we'll end up
consolidating anyway, because the benefits of consolidation so greatly
outweigh the negatives in practice. If we don't flock towards one (any one)
license or a small group, look what happens:
http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical . This situation is frustrating
- how can I tell if any 2 or 3 licenses are compatible? What if I'm given
the task of combining materials licensed under 2 or 3 of them? I'm not a
lawyer, I don't know! So I just won't perform the task.
Or if it's critical, I will combine the materials and ignore the licensing.
I have no other choice. I've no time to deal with this!

I'd really rather that this situation does not repeat from the software
sector into the scholarly sector.

I'm definitely against forcing a license on people. However, I don't
consider it necessary to pick a different license to what everybody else
has picked if that serves my needs too. CC-BY seems to serve scholars'
needs (I'm not one, hence "seems").

Greetings,
Emanuil

I've got nothing to add to Mark's description of Cottage Labs. I'm a
software developer, not a currently active scholar. I'd rather that all
scholars and the public could access each other's work. I'd also like to
see good business and not-for-profit initiatives building on top of that
work and making it even easier to access, relate, analyse and derive value
from (and drive research forward). I want all the text, all the data and
all the metadata open (as per the Open Definition ideally) so that this
kind of innovation can develop, coming both from scholars themselves and
others who wish to help scholarship.

The GPL is a great example. The GPL is copyleft, i.e. -SA. Turned out,
though, that companies can't always share all their code for competitive
reasons.
"Amazing! Sharing is forever encouraged and *required*!", said those who
liked GPL.
"Err..", said the software developer who received tens of requests for dual
licensing from companies wanting to use his GPL code in great commercial
applications that he would have allowed without asking. They couldn't
open-source their core products though.
"I just wanted to share my code and I was told this is how you do open
source by a friend. I don't really want to deal with all this admin work.
Rejecting them all is bad too, I like some of them a lot. Maybe I need to
change my license."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- Now dual-licensed under MIT ( http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT ) and GPL

"Hm, we don't like this. You should have just left them in the mud if they
wouldn't share their enhancements to the code." - said supporters of the
GPL.
"Well, actually they did share some *other* code and other stuff, because
they felt compelled to and it has so many benefits, like attracting
talented developers. Also it got really bad really quickly - I never
realised other open source projects would be prevented from using my code
and now I'm really angry!"
- "Huh? How come?", asked the GPL supporters.
- "Well if they've picked MIT to be commercially friendly or because they
didn't care about forcing sharing, they can't use the GPL. It's copyleft,
remember? They have to release a GPL version of their code if they use any
of mine! I never meant to force other developers to pick a license for
their work!"
- "Well, they should make this little bit of effort and join the true
sharing community and make sure their work is forever shareable.", retorted
GPL supporters.
- "I'm angry now I'm even spending time on this issue. I wanted to code and
share my code. And discuss this with others. Not discuss licenses. I am no
longer participating in this discussion."

HypotheticalSoftwareProject changelog:
Most recent version:
- No longer licensed under the GPL. If you want to use the GPL code for
some odd reason, go back to the version which had it. Beware, no support of
any kind will be offered for old versions. Use the latest version to report
any problems or bugs.

And so, except in some exceptional cases, nowadays the majority of open
source code is not GPL, but one of the other ones listed here under Popular
Licenses: http://opensource.org/licenses , all created to serve different
needs, but none containing blanket restrictions like -NC and -SA. (There
are still quite a few GPL projects.)

Obviously papers are not code and one wouldn't necessarily mix & match text
from papers to produce new papers. However, the lessons learned from trying
to apply downstream restrictions still hold true. (And besides, who am I to
say there isn't a truly good and innovative idea to be had in mix &
matching scholarly papers.) Newly minted software developers like me
usually know this: Do. not. restrict. usage. of. your. open. source. code.
without exceedingly good narrow reasons forced by a very specific situation
on you. You will end up hurting causes and projects you like, and will not
stop those who only wish to take and not contribute back.

I feel that there's such a big push for CC-BY because people are concerned
about fragmenting the scholarly sector in superficial legal ways. The
cracks take a lot of time and frustration to close, and we'll end up
consolidating anyway, because the benefits of consolidation so greatly
outweigh the negatives in practice. If we don't flock towards one (any one)
license or a small group, look what happens:
http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical . This situation is frustrating
- how can I tell if any 2 or 3 licenses are compatible? What if I'm given
the task of combining materials licensed under 2 or 3 of them? I'm not a
lawyer, I don't know! So I just won't perform the task.
Or if it's critical, I will combine the materials and ignore the licensing.
I have no other choice. I've no time to deal with this!

I'd really rather that this situation does not repeat from the software
sector into the scholarly sector.

I'm definitely against forcing a license on people. However, I don't
consider it necessary to pick a different license to what everybody else
has picked if that serves my needs too. CC-BY seems to serve scholars'
needs (I'm not one, hence "seems").

Greetings,
Emanuil

Hi,

I would like to second Emanuil's concerns, and am in a similar
situation. I have done a lot of work in open source, including many
GPL communities. The open source community abandoned NC, ND etc very
early on as they do not fit in any open landscape - commercial
activity can be so ambiguous and you are restricting certain groups
from taking part. Copyleft/SA make requirements on everything, not
just the licensed work, leading to discussions/analysis/time spent
figuring out compatibility etc.

I favor permissive licenses now for software, and hope to see the same
for scientific works and data. I really hope that open access can be
defined simply as CC-BY or equally permissive, without having to
figure out you meant the CC-BY-SA-NC-ND version. I am pleased to see
Creative Commons went ahead and made it clear that NC, ND etc are not
free cultural work approved too.

These concerns are real, and I sincerely hope that the open access
term can be reserved for works with no restriction on where/how they
are used, just like open source is. I disagree that the licensing
questions are very different, and in fact feel there are many
commonalities in the debate. I totally agree that software licenses
should be used for software, and CC licenses are better suited to
publishing, but access and reuse are important commonalities shared by
both communities.

CC BY-SA (and CC0) are also OKD conformant.

Remember, if possible in your jurisdiction, you can always use CC0 for pretty much any and everything.

Certainly, although MIT/BSD is generally better recognized and
understood in the context of software. I won't push the topic
off-track too much, I think the OKD definition of open access nicely
mirrors the OSI's definition of open source. CC0 does not appear in
their list of OSI approved licenses, which would make its application
in software problematic for many.

Yes, perhaps. All depends on whose religion you want to believe in. FSF does recommend CC0 for PD dedication (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CC0) and CC mentions the same in their FAQ as well (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ#May_I_apply_CC0_to_computer_software.3F_If_so.2C_is_there_a_recommended_implementation.3F)

CC is interested in possibly working on removing the one hitch that caused OSI to not recommend CC0 (http://opensource.org/faq#cc-zero), but that concern may not apply to many software developers.

Religion is a bit of a loaded term, but for many commercial developers
the OSI analysis is an important one as they invest the time to
analyze licenses for potential pitfalls. If it is not OSI-approved,
then it is often a non-starter as legal teams at companies will often
employ that as a minimum bar. See for example Google's Summer of Code
program FAQ as a public example,

https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page#2._What_licenses_do_I_have_to_choose

Perhaps not, although it speaks to a certain amount of brand
recognition. I trust the OKD list of open access licenses, and the OSI
list of open source licenses.

I would say part of it is recognition, many of us in software know
what we are getting with MIT, 3-clause BSD, GPLv2, GPLv3+, etc. In
addition, the MIT, BSD, Apache licenses have been around longer, legal
teams recognize them pretty quickly and many debates have already been
had and settled. This may change over time, part of it is likely a
marketing/communication issue for Creative Commons. These are purely
my opinions as a developer working for an open-source scientific
software company in the US (previously academia in the UK), and I work
with many who still feel GPL is needed to ensure freedom...

Sincerely,

Marcus

Dear All

Just a reminder about the call in a little over 15 mins for anyone who
wishes to join!

It's been brought to my attention that a 0 got appended to the agenda URL,
which should have been http://okfnpad.org/p/science-coord-20jan2014

Do check this out at your convenience if you can't make the call and I look
forward to speaking to some of you shortly.

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] Open Science WG 2014 - Tasks and Team!
Message-ID: <CABPM+wrdhPJZWOkX7Mhg+pqB-Ro6MQ6RMSrOzVKyVnxAGQ5t=w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Thanks to those who joined in the meeting yesterday evening [1], we
discussed what the working group should focus on for 2014 and also having a
coordination team to make sure everything runs smoothly - a special thanks
to all those who volunteered to help out with this and all those
coordinating local groups and projects. We'd love your feedback and
suggestions on the ideas below or new projects you would like to propose.

*Open Science Working Group 2014 Projects* (followed by specific
activities/tasks and initial coordinators)

   1. *Content-mining* (Puneet Kishor, Peter Murray-Rust, Ross Mounce)
   - Case studies/awareness raising
      - Workshops (inc. possibly one at OKFest)
      - Interested in joining? There is a new mailing list [2]
      - Look out for a separate call on this project
   2. *Local groups* (Graham Steele)
      - Expanding the number of open science ambassadors and local groups.
      - Local group starter kit (howto, mailing list, wiki, website,
      visibility in global working group).
      - Map and directory on WG website to help people find local open
      science activities.
   3. *Open Science Census* (Local groups)
   - Mapping local open science landscape - relevant law and policy,
      funding, initiatives, attitudes etc
      - A Brazilian example
      https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Pesquisa:Ci%C3%AAncia_aberta_no_Brasil
      - To be led by individuals or local groups - get in touch if you are
      interested in writing and finding collaborators to work on a report for
      your country!
   4. *Open Science for Development* (Jenny Molloy)
   - This year we were involved in a scoping project around open science in
      the global South and will continue to engage in community building and
      collaboration with the partners we gained from that.
   5. *Building Open Science Manuals *(Anyone interested in coordinating
   this?)
      - Improving English Wikipedia pages on Open Science
      - Compiling resources e.g.
      http://digitheadslabnotebook.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/guide-to-open-science.html

      - Sharing knowledge from local groups e.g.
      https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Manual_de_Ci?ncia_Aberta
   6. *Open Science Training *(Anyone interested in coordinating this?)
      - Panton Fellow Sophie Kay developed a fantastic training initiative
      http://www.opensciencetraining.com/
      - We would like to start a conversation and compile further open
      materials for teaching aspects of open science or using open science in
      teaching.

*Working Group Coordination*

Mailing list: Ross Mounce
Blog Editors: Kathleen Luschek, Rayna St and Scott Edmunds
Website and Social Media: Brian Glanz and Graham Steele
Local Groups: Graham Steele
WG and Advisory Board Meetings: Stefan Kasberger, Keren Limor, Suchith
Anand, Sridhar Gutam
General Coordination: Jenny Molloy

If anyone else would like to get involved, you are still welcome to sign up
on the volunteer sheet [3] - the more the merrier.

Thanks very much and look out for communications from the new team very
soon, we are also hoping to see an overhaul of some of the website features
so it is much easier to add yourself as a working group member and find
others interested in open science in your area or specialism!

Jenny

Hey everyone,

Thanks much for the wrap-up apologies I couldn't attend, but am travelling
these days and it's a bit tricky to reconcile everything :-)

A question that doesn't seem to have had an answer: who'll ttake care of
the board and tech liaisons?

Message-ID: <mailman.9.1390325476.6293.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Second Call for Posters ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-posters

11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Poster and Demo Chairs:
- Raphael Troncy (Multimedia Department, EURECOM, FR)
- Eva Blomqvist (Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, SE)

		
The poster track of ESWC 2014 will provide an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, on-going research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Posters are intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect with each other and to engage in discussions about the work.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Web that address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track. Theoretical or technical posters, reports on semantic systems (however, demonstrations of such systems should be submitted in the demo track), descriptions of completed work, and work in progress are equally welcome.

Papers submitted to the research track will NOT automatically be considered for the poster track. A separate poster submission must be made. For example, a poster can be used to present work that was insufficiently mature for the research track.


* Submission Guidelines *

Authors must submit a 4-page paper (PDF, Springer LNCS style) with a short abstract for evaluation. The paper must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ESWC 2014. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

Submissions should be uploaded using the Easychair system:
	https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014pd


* Important Dates *

Submission Deadline: March 16, 2014
Notification of Acceptance: April 10, 2014
Camera-Ready Paper: April 25, 2014


* Important Notes *

Poster papers will appear in supplementary post-conference proceedings to be published by Springer in the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS).

Participants with an accepted poster must register for the conference and present their work during the Poster Session. A space will be allocated for each participant. The organizers should be contacted well in advance of the conference in case of any special requirement.

http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-demos

11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)

- Raphael Troncy (Multimedia Department, EURECOM, FR)
- Eva Blomqvist (Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, SE)

	
The demonstrations track of the ESWC 2014 complements the overall program of the conference with demonstrations of real-world, applied-and-tested advances of semantic technologies. In addition to papers and posters presenting latest theoretical achievements, the ESWC 2014 is seeking demonstrations of novel applications of semantics in various sectors, including: eGovernment,  eEnvironment, eMobility and smart cities, eHealth, Life Sciences, Sensor networks and RDF Stream Processing, Linked Science, Media and entertainment, Telecommunications, Cultural heritage, Financial services, Energy and utilities, Manufacturing, Digital libraries, Cloud applications, Personal Information Management, Decision support, Emergency and crisis management etc.

The demonstrations track is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their innovative prototypes, practical developments, on-going projects, lessons learned and late-breaking results, relevant for the topics of interest of the main conference and the research and poster tracks.

Submissions to the demonstrations track should make clear what will be demonstrated, and in particular point out what makes the demonstration a novel showcase. A video of the demo should be provided if a link to the demonstrator is not available. Submission should also specify:

* What is the research background and application context of the demonstration, and what makes this a novel showcase for semantic technologies.
* What is the key technology used, and how does the demonstrated system, application or infrastructure relate to pre-existing work.
* What exactly will be demonstrated? What exactly will a visitor of the demonstration learn?
 

* Submission Guidelines *

Submissions to the demonstrations track must be in the form of a textual description of the demonstration to be given at the conference (which may include screenshots and must include either a link to the online demo or a video presenting it). The submissions must be at most 5 pages long including reference list (Springer LNCS style) and submitted as PDF. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web area, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

Submissions should be uploaded using the Easychair system:

Hey Stefan

Just to say that this sounds fantastic - if anyone is interested in doing
something similar in other languages get in touch, whether you're a member
of a local group already or not.
It would be fantastic to make these kind of updates available more widely
across different regions.

Absolutely agree, das ist wirklich super! I would love to hear more about
what's going on in various countries and linguapheres - many of us can read
some additional languages, but do not have the capacity to follow numerous
blogs, mailing lists, etc, so such a master list is incredibly useful.
(Also content in other languages tends to be excluded from common "hubs").
Of course, very brief summaries in English might be useful too.

This is perhaps pushing the issue a bit, but I have thought a lot about how
to coordinate the spreading of information better within organizations or
communities across languages. I really liked what Global Voices do for blog
posts for example. I wonder if it could be crowd-sourced somehow - I
personally don't know much about what goes on in Open Access in Germany,
but given a few blog posts, I'd be willing to volunteer my time to write
quick summaries in English (or Norwegian/Chinese etc) if there was a demand
for it...

The Open Access Tracking Project (OATP) does much of what Stian describes.
It tries to tag OA news and comment in every country and field, and asks
taggers to post descriptions in English. (Some taggers do and some don't.)
Here for example, is the feed for OA developments in Germany. This is the
HTML version of the feed, but it's also available in RSS, Atom, and JSONP,
and of course the RSS feed can be converted to a Twitter or email feed as
well. Of course all the feeds are OA.
http://tagteam.harvard.edu/hubs/oatp/tag/oa.germany

Here's the overall OATP feed (all new OA developments regardless of country
or field).
http://tagteam.harvard.edu/remix/oatp

For more detail, see the OATP home page
http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_tracking_project

I'd be happy to say more for those who are interested in creating OATP
feeds (as taggers) or subscribing to them (as readers).

     Best,
     Peter

Hi Peter,

I used to be a very avid follower of your blog and still read your longer
newsletter (usually by forwarding them to my Kindle). I think it's
interesting to think about the difference between a "human-curated" and
presented summary, and a more automatic approach. I am aware that all the
items added to the OATP are of course tagged by humans, who choose tags
etc. However, even though I know about the project very well, and have on
occasion submitted items, I don't regularly follow any of the tags. I
wonder if part of it is just the interface (and perhaps I just need to add
some of the RSS feeds to my reader). Perhaps some of it is that it's hard
to distinguish importance (I see about 12 items added just today, with no
other information than the title on this page:
http://tagteam.harvard.edu/remix/oatp)... Or maybe the short commentaries
from someone you get to know over time, and whose choices you grow to
trust, are important.

A few examples of such "summaries" that I use a lot are Stephen Downes'
daily summary of open education news, Hacker News, and r/haskell on Reddit
(the two later ones add discussions of course). I would love to know of
more sources like these in other languages, for fields that interest me.
I've several times mentioned to Chinese colleagues that it would be great
if someone set up a blog there which summarized developments in open
access, open education, distance learning etc. There is a lot happening,
and almost nothing is exposed to the outer world. (And by doing so, the
person would automatically become the go to for Western academics and
journalists who want to learn more/collaborate).

Sorry if these musings aren't entirely on topic, but I guess the question
of how we spread ideas and information about research globally is related
to "open-science"...

Stian

Hi Stian,

OATP runs on TagTeam, an open-source tagging platform we're developing at
Harvard primarily for OATP. When TagTeam version 1.5 comes out (in just a
few days, I hope!) it will have a way to address the problem you identify.
Right now, all the items tagged with "oa.germany" (for example) are in a
single list with no indication of their importance. Like a blog, the most
recent items are at the top of the list. But if a person you trusted were
tagging the German OA developments *important to her*, then you could
easily follow her judgments. She could create a sub-feed of the
"oa.germany" items she had marked as important. And if she didn't, then you
could create one yourself.

Among other things, TagTeam allows users to create feeds based on arbitrary
boolean combinations of keywords or tags. In version 1.5, it will be very
easy to create a feed with the property "has tag TAG *and* was tagged by
USER". Then the trick will be to get people you trust to tag items within
their area of expertise.

     Peter

Having said that, the background about Cottage Labs is very interesting, and makes a good case study, and IMO a compelling case for more open licenses on research output: plainly Cottage Labs provides important and valuable services to the research community, and obstacles, such as NC licenses, which make those services harder, and therefore more expensive, are undesirable and act as a taxation on other researchers.  This equally applies to other organisations providing services to researchers and educators (like, say, Kitware, or the CCF): people ought to be paid for their work, they will have to do more work to overcome such obstacles, and that money is obviously going to come out of research and education budgets.

I work on science software process improvement, under the CCF umbrella.  CCF is a non-profit organisation, and I am not paid for the work, but it could certainly be held to be ?commercial? in a court.  If I find I have to read NC-licensed research (for instance, a social science paper on the growth of the use of alt metrics in institutional systems of professional recognition and advancement) as part of my CCF work (say: to prepare a workshop presentation on the importance of open-source licensing of scientific software), then I might either 

(a) ignore the license and read it anyway;
(b) disregard the research and find something else to make my point;
(c) spend time figuring out whether there?s a paywall alternative, how much it might cost, and whether it?s worth it (based on the abstract); or
(d) contact the rights owners and beg an exemption.

NC advocates appear to want me to do (c) or (d).  Frankly, I rarely make those choices, and I doubt whether other people working in similar organisations make them either.

As it happens, part of his work product is software, which is open-source licensed (for instance, a quick look at the Cottage Labs site suggests that DSpace has a BSD-like license), but AIUI that is not relevant to his main point here.  If Mark needs to read a research paper in order to do his work, then an NC license on that paper inhibits him from doing so.  The same would be true were he a plumber or a chef.

>>> In response to the question of conflict of interest:
>>> 
>>> I am Mark MacGillivray, an academic at the University of Edinburgh, currently completing my PhD entitled Studies in open scholarship. I have shared information in relation to my studies on these lists previously. It is in this capacity that I engage in these lists, as I have done so both prior to my PhD course but in other studies, and prior to the existence of Cottage Labs.
>>> 
>>> I am also a Founder and Senior partner of Cottage Labs LLP, where Emanuil is an associate. Cottage Labs itself has no interest in this matter - it is an LLP, set up solely as an administrative entity specifically for the purpose of enabling people who want to trade their skills to those that wish to purchase them. Cottage Labs has no capability to express interests nor to generate a profit for itself, as a limited liability partnership in the UK is unable to do so - income minus costs equals payment for those involved, and that is all. However, we are still a commercial entity and what we do is a commercial enterprise, and we earn a living from it.
>>> 
>>> Cottage Labs develops open source software for a range of people, most commonly academic or academic-related people and institutions. We get paid for our skills and time, which we openly negotiate on every project we work for, and the output of our work is made freely available to be used by anyone at no extra cost, for whatever they want.
>>> 
>>> However, despite making the output of our work freely available, and demonstrating and documenting how to use it, and helping people install and set up services using that material, we have found that there are a large number of people and organisations who simply do not have the technical capability to be able to run their own services. Hence, we have found that even though they are freely available to do so themselves, they often want to hire us to do more than just develop software. For example, they want us to run services.
>>> 
>>> So as far as Cottage Labs has an interest in these discussions, it is the as yet hypothetical interest of myself and others to do just this. I would like to be able to use my skills to help scholarship advance, but to do so I need to get paid or I cannot stay alive. The same is true of most academics. Therefore I would like to build the services that people need - e.g. that support the values they desire - and run them at a price that is reasonable.
>>> 
>>> So let's say I build a service that distributes content at a reasonable price - and by reasonable I mean whatever it costs us to run it, including paying ourselves (and I would be happy to make that public too). If the service is valuable people will pay me for it, and there is nothing wrong with that. If I try to increase the price too much, people are absolutely free to take all the content, and replicate the service - they could even use the code I wrote if they wish, because it is freely available too. Therefore it is in my interests to offer a reasonable trade. I am holding myself to account.
>>> 
>>> That is what I want to be able to do, but I cannot run the thing for free. So can I personally profit from running the service (pay my bills, buy food, etc) if I am using NC or even SA content or tech? Yes, but not without at least getting into an argument about it. However if the content or tech is unrestricted and usable for anything, I have no concern and neither do consumers of my service because they are not locked in to it, nor to the content, nor to any prior decision about how it should be used.
>>> 
>>> Here is an interesting point I am freely willing to admit: in every project I have been involved in to date, the only thing that licensing demands have done for the project is to increase its complexity. This means that managing the additional licensing requirements asked of me does nothing to improve the quality of the software nor that of the service that the software provides to the target audience - no scholar has ever said "please can you make sure I cannot access X". However, I do make more money because increased complexity equates to more requirements and more work, and in the case of the hypothetical service described above it would justify a higher cost. So, once again, the manufacture of scarcity results in increased profit.
>>> 
>>> By taking the conflict of interest that is the restrictions on usability of scholarly (or any) content out of the equation altogether, what we have left is a complete freedom to act on our willingness to work together with people who share our goals, and to collaborate and trade based on the skills we have to offer rather than the products we can stockpile.
>>> 
>>> In my personal opinion, restriction simply places demands on other people despite having no idea what it is they may want to do, and no idea of how it may benefit or hinder any particular goal. It is a fearful approach to what would otherwise be an inclusive and joyous activity. I would not even argue for BY. I think that the application of copyright and licensing is pollution, and so we should minimise how much of it we spread about in the first place.
>>> 
>>> If an academic of the future were to find something of interest to them, would you prefer that they pay close attention to the licensing conditions of said item when deciding whether to prioritise it for scholarship and their public good, or that they make their evaluation based on the qualities of the item itself? I would hope that they treat the licensing as nothing more than dirt to be swept off the cover.

If they think it "makes my article free to read (and to text mine) [and open access]", then that's what will happen - eventually - regardless of how somebody else interprets the license to suit a perhaps ageing business model. They'll just think RightsLink is plain wrong to do what they do.

I'm sure opinion will be divided - but some will definitely support the buying of added value and convenience if it can truly aid their research. Added value / convenience or saved time in exchange for money is the underlying premise of a lot of business after all, and it can even be argued that it's one of the best sustainability models and innovation drivers. Pulling in enough money to support a team to work on such an obviously non-trivial project is important if it's to be kept alive and upgraded significantly.
>>>> However, it's my understanding that CC-BY-NC would prevent this kind of scenario. And as I said, not all scholars would be against this kind of scenario. But they aren't going to think about it when picking CC-BY-NC because "I don't want RightsLink to sell my article".
>>>> 
>>>> Downstream usage with no strings attached seems like the obvious way to go - we don't know what the downstream usage WILL be. So, we guess, we try to exclude a use case we don't like, and we create a big legal and conceptual mess. Useless. We're making your research and ALL research less useful every time we include a special condition in the licensing. (The "all research" reason is that we make aggregators' lives very difficult, like those hypothetical medical text mining people, or even cases as simple as the DOAJ. So we're unintentionally hurting causes and use cases most scholars wouldn't have even heard of.)
>>>> 
>>>> There's an entirely separate issue that's usually conflated with the published work itself - the metadata about the work. Where is it located, what's its license, what's its identifier, etc. You can collect all that info and none of it would fall under the work's license itself. (Naturally this metadata is quite hard to get in a consistent way if you're not the originating publisher and copyright has been claimed over it, even though the underlying works are CC-BY or some other open license.)
>>>> 
>>>> Again, even if we somehow created this data from scratch (scraping and so on), then how would we publish it? CC-BY - no problems for downstream applications, they can use us together with other data sources and slap an attribution link somewhere sensible. CC-BY-NC or CC-BY-SA .. not so much. If downstream users wanted to combine our data with some CC-BY data, could they? What if they republished the combined dataset? What does the sum of CC-BY + CC-BY-NC datasets produce, legally?
>>>> DOAJ kind of illustrates this in fact, since their data is under CC-BY-SA, which means that if I were to combine their dataset with other data, I'd have to release the result under CC-BY-SA, which may hurt MY downstream data consumers in ways I can't imagine.
>>>> 
>>>> So yes, CC-BY comes with no strings attached for downstream usage because that hurts the flow of information and makes people deal with unintended (sometimes to the point of being silly) scenarios when they should be focussing on running their business or otherwise enhancing society.
>>>> 
>>>> Additionally, attaching restrictions to data use is practically useless unless you can back your copyright infringement claims up. People serious about their causes / businesses will just do what they have to to get their experimental software / data flows / whatever off the ground and they won't look at your license a single time if it's physically possible to obtain the data. Then they may start caring about licensing, though probably not. People just take what they need when it's published, and we should recognise this and expect it instead of shun it with -NC clauses (and in some cases even -SA).
>>>> 
>>>> The reason we can't go and download all the papers from publishers' websites like Aaron Swartz did is not because their incredible restrictive website ToS says so, it's because they have enough cash to back up their ToS. And maybe (depending on personal values) because whoever does this would be concerned they'd hurt real people (they do work at publishing companies ..).

I see dangers to open access itself through CC-BY, in addition to these arguments that this focus on licensing ignores steps which would be much more effective in achieving the kind of re-use many CC-BY advocates argue for (attending to formats and metadata standards, for example).

An entry point into this argument that all proponents of CC-BY as default should pay attention to: there is nothing in any of the CC licenses that obligates either licensor or licensee to make materials free of charge. It is true that you cannot add DRM to a work downstream to enforce downstream property rights, but you can put up a paywall before the person gets to the work.

hey,

I'm really interested in point 5+6, and already done some things in this.

  * workshop for students how to work the open way in science & research
    (scientific writing)sy
  * several documents to do courses with open source tools and open data
  * organized an course with 15 students on openscienceasap.org


My opinion is, that one of the key strategies must be to educate 
multiplicators, like teachers and trainees, to teach open methods on 
universities and in education. we should make it as easy as possible for 
them to use zotero or libre office and share it in an open format.

so would like to hear your experiences and see some other work on this. 
maybe an workshop/meetup at okfestival would be be a good idea.

cheers, stefan

publishers. Nothing more. It adds no value to the author or user - in facts
it adds negative value by preventing easy re-use.

Publishers such as BMC and PLOS do not route users to RightsLink. They make
is clear in many obvious places that the reader has almost complete rights
- except that they have to acknowledge the author (CC-BY).

By contrast many publishers (especially of hybrids) put a prominent
"Request Permissions" on the splash page which takes people to RightsLink.
If the paper is CC-BY then RightsLink SHOULD display a notice saying "You
are free to use and reuse and redistribute this article without charge for
whatever purpose - see CC-BY licence". In practice many of them issues
charges via RightsLink for CC-BY articles. This is unacceptable and similar
to the many companies (as in UK PPI) who offer charged services for content
or services that the government make freely / openly available.

The commonest offender is Elsevier where CC-BY papers frequently link to
RightsLink and are charged. I have highlighted many examples on my blog (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr) and Elsevier says it's "technical problems"
and "please give them time to fix it". It should never have happened. I
have no idea whether they refund money.

Although the first port of call is usually an Elsevier website. As there
may be other routes in to RightsLink, it would be good to fix that -
however Elsevier really haven't got an excuse for not making the rights of
an Open Access article clear on their own website and not routing through
to RightsLink in the first place.

Message-ID: <CABOTVX-Kr6hHGxDcZ8jMo8QZ5hgrJ9CtHB7kjUngbPW01D+cAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I'm creating a list of people who are happy to talk about Open Access at
events. This will act both as an internal resource for us (the Open
Knowledge Foundation receive a lot of requests for speakers) and an
external/online resource for people who are looking to put on events and
don't know who to approach.

The Open Knowledge Foundation will be catalysing more events about Open
Access in the UK over the next few months, and hopefully we can do the same
around the world. Having a list of people we can approach to talk is a
great start to doing this!

A short blog post and link to the form can be found here:
http://access.okfn.org/2014/01/24/looking-for-open-access-speakers/

Please pass it on among your networks - and do sign up yourself. It commits
you to nothing right now :-)

Best wishes,
Michelle

Hi Heather,

You are completely correct in saying that something like the RightsLink
mess is not legally preventable if everything is licensed CC-BY en-masse.

But then there are 3 issues of practical importance that merit
consideration:

1/ Can we enforce our legal rights even if we chose a different license for
our scholarly works?
In short, I believe that the answer to this is "no". You're not going to
sue RightsLink on your own, because you have things which are actually
worthwhile to focus on, such as the actual work which underlies the outputs
you produce.

A group of people might be able to do it. But this requires significant
time to be sunk into organisation and even persuading others to back you.
Again, this is a problem of resources in practice.

What actually prevents businesses from doing what RightsLink is doing is
the immense reputation damage which this will cause. If they are a new
company (start-up size) in the scholarly or more narrowly, the OA sector,
they may be destroyed completely! Nobody with enough knowledge about Open
Access would invest time or money in such a high-risk, low-profit
enterprise.
Also, as this paragraph implies, I do think that RightsLink will either be
fixed or go down, once the costs of running what's almost a scam outgrow
the profit.

2/ What else did we just prevent?
We've tread on this topic enough in this tread. We don't know what
downstream restrictions might prevent, regardless of whether they're NC, ND
or even SA-style (or any other type). I don't really think that scholars
can enumerate the sensible ways (commercial and otherwise) in which their
work can be used, or that they would care to try. Research to do, papers to
write, etc.

3/ Does it matter that things like RightsLink can sell Open Access
materials for exorbitant sums of money?

No, not at all. If we, as a community of people interested in the progress
of scholarship, dislike what RightsLink are doing we shouldn't *just* point
a finger and condemn them (though that's also not bad). We should come up
with an equally good way of distributing OA articles!

* * *

We have to ask "why are they able to do this?", not "how can we stop them
from doing this?". Well, why are they able to do this? They have a big
audience. They have thousands of scholars checking pages on which
RightsLink is promoted every DAY. Money has been poured into the software
development, hosting and integration of that service with a variety of
systems that really large publishers hold. As a consequence, they can do
whatever they like!

But distributing OA articles and making them discoverable costs money and
time + big publishing houses may be quite unhelpful. Presumably RightsLink
requires quite a bit of metadata to operate. I don't think they'll hand
this over to the OA community (just yet) - yet they are doing exactly that
with RightsLink. So if we want to build this better alternative to
RightsLink, we may need even MORE resources than them, because the
publishers will be unhelpful.

Where should those resources come from? We could charge readers directly ..
for OA content .. which would be doing the same as RightsLink.
Hmmm. Not very appealing.

We could also think about taking a gradual approach:
1/ Think about what such a system will involve.
2/ Think about current sources of data and papers (Open University CORE
system, institutional repositories and lists of such repositories, the
DOAJ...).
3/ Build proof of concept tools which perform small parts of the work. E.g.
http://howopenisit.org/ is kinda like RightsLink in the sense that it tries
to tell you what the license of an article is, except that PLoS funded the
initial development and the hosting and now it's free to use, though it has
severe problems with identifying article licenses. It's getting improved
next month.

We will also need some more parts, like a catalogue, a dissemination
mechanism, a cheap hosting mechanism and quite a few other bits.

But who is going to pay for this? Not the readers. So our best bet are
organisations interested in OA. The various foundations (Mozilla has strong
open science involvement now), publishers who would like their content
distributed to more scholars for less money than it'd take them to do it,
others I haven't thought of. Maybe even universities (maybe ones that don't
have an institutional repository and don't want one right now).

So there we go, we have a commercial project which builds, maintains and
expands clean and well-made mechanisms for distributing Open Access
content. It deals with nothing but metadata and openly licensed PDF-s.

Now, I know you're not arguing for CC-BY-NC specifically. However, anything
that is not on CC-BY's level of openness ("freedom given to downstream
users") is going to create UNexpected difficulties. NC will make it legally
bad, SA may create legal compatibility problems with simple -BY articles.
If you imagine yourself as the creator of this service, you've already got
a really difficult job ahead of you. You don't want any more difficulties
than absolutely necessary! And we as a community don't *want* to place
unneeded burden on this hypothetical service builder & maintainer.

I can't speak for the OA community, but I think this kind of scenario is
closer to what Mark was going for than "let's make another RightsLink".

Business is a way to solve practical problems, how "well" a business
behaves will *ultimately* depend on the values of its creators.
Doing business with OA content is just a way of solving the severe
difficulties the OA movement has in expanding its influence and bringing
tangible benefits to society, it's not "bad" per se. The question is - is
the business bound to the profits of an established publisher, or is it
free to prioritise the needs of scholars and the public above all else?

But maybe those ideas are worthless. Maybe I'm just not imaginative +
experienced enough to be able to envisage good solutions. If that is the
case, I'd still rather that all scholarly content was licensed in a way
which did not prevent somebody better than me from having a go.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Hi Michelle,

The Open Access Directory (OAD) has long maintained an OA speakers bureau.
http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/OA_speakers_bureau

Some potential speakers might not know about it and therefore might not
have signed up. But wouldn't it be better to enlarge OAD list than start a
new one?

OAD is a wiki. To prevent spam, contributions are limited to registered
users, but registration is free and easy.

Indeed, which is why I don't think they're in a good position to be the
caretakers of a good Open Access dissemination mechanism. I do think they
should try to do better with regards to their own OA content, but can
understand why this is proving difficult for them.

We may simple need to avoid the publicly traded model for the time being. I
don't want to imply that this is the best model for the technical and
social solutions that Open Access needs. It could be a non-profit too. Or a
private company, if more suitable (then the values-of-the-creators idea
would really hold true). But we don't know which approach is best. I would
really rather keep options open than just kill any potential commercial
innovation in this area.
(A non-scholarly example: http://tosdr.org/about.html - they manage to do
useful work and get funding. They don't say what kind of legal body they
are and I suspect they may not have one, i.e. just loose collection of
individuals. It doesn't have to be more complex than that, although a
(private) LLC has some advantages in limiting personal liability.)

The fact that people could behave unethically or in a way which we don't
like does not mean all of them will. I don't want to stand in the way of
those who do try to have a wholesome approach for the best interests of
scholars AND the public. And my point is that it doesn't matter that some
*other* people will behave in a way with which we disagree.

The fact they're anti-competitive doesn't mean we should kill any chance of
competition in this field by endorsing -NC or any other downstream usage
restriction and end up in a "no person, no problem"-style situation where
we sit and congratulate each other on the successful prevention of some
activity.

There is also the issue that commercial organisations *are* part of the
public (indeed, much of our current society has been built on the back of
commercial innovation). Open scholarship means open to use by the public,
and that includes businesses - private, public, small, big, partnerships
and sole traders. This seems to be the heart of the Open Definition
principle of "does not discriminate against fields of endeavour".

It just isn't open otherwise - and not just theoretically. I do think that
in practice -NC scholarship intentionally limits its beneficial impact on
society.

"Businesses" includes even non-profits (who, albeit non-commercial on paper
or with *ultimate* non-profit goals, obviously need to "conduct business"
in their daily operations). Also I realise that non-profits may be affected
differently by -NC, but I don't think they'll be immune to its chilling
effects in practice.

One last thing - you have a more than excellent grasp of copyright,
licensing and intellectual property. But not everybody does, including
myself, and I feel that way even though I've spent about 8 years trying to
understand copyright, licensing and intellectual property law (such as the
patent system). Obviously this is not full-time, but rather I've always
tried to take a proactive learning stance as far as practically reasonable
in the course of my work.

I feel there is a rather large number of scholars and individual members of
the public who are in a similar position. We need to know "I am allowed to
do the thing I want to do by the author" without having to understand the
precise definition of "commercial" or copyright law (i.e. licensing applies
to the copy, not the intellectual property presented in the copy).
I do not feel that it's worth sacrificing this clarity of indirect
communication between millions of people (scholars and all kinds of
consumers of their outputs) for the asserted ability to potentially stop
somebody from selling scholarly outputs.

CC-BY does not need to prove its benefits. It has profoundly changed the
way humans deal with the written word for the better, especially as far as
reuse is concerned - and has eliminated the need for clarification and
requesting permission from the author, saving an incalculable (literally)
amount of effort. It has also been a band-aid for the copyright and IP
systems due to simplifying the exchange of information so much that
individuals don't have to know legal details in order to get on with their
work. I cannot say the same for -NC, -SA, -ND or any other downstream
restriction.

Greetings,
Emanuil

For those of you who were not able to participate live last week, the
video recording of our SlideWiki.org webinar is now available:

http://youtu.be/r6cPQGij5Wo

As mentioned before, SlideWiki facilitates the translation of courses
through Google Translate API integration and crowdsourcing of the
required revisioning process. From my perspective the use of SlideWiki
could facilitate the creation and translation of OKF's various Open X
Books ;-)

Best,

it happens all the time, I've recently had this situation with an Informa paper where we've paid them the money but there is no indication anywhere on the paper or in the html that its open, and it becomes an extra thing to chase up and these are only the papers that I have come across, I'm sure there are many more that should have the information displayed correctly

Hey all,

I'm really keen to promote the whole 'open science' stuff with non typical
audiences.In fact it's one of my key aims for 2014.

I wondered if people here had seen Soapbox Science:
http://soapboxscience.org/ (UK based only I'm afraid).

They are looking for female academics to talk (part of an ongoing
'increasing diversity in science agenda') - and I was wondering if there
was anyone in the working group who would be willing to pitch ideas
including an 'open science' angle.

Best,
Michelle

There will always be reasons for people to *worry*. This is completely
disconnected from reality though. I may worry about a lot of things which
will never happen, but I try to deal with reality in such a way that my
worries don't get in the way of others.

It just becomes a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
Somebody could print my paper and cause arson using the copy as kindling,
so let's license the copy under My Own License Attribution NoArson and make
indirect communication between millions of people (== licensing) more
difficult. Adding support for that license to the various systems which
deal with scholarship does cost *real* resources, others may not understand
if NoArson is compatible with other conditions in other licenses and it
just contributes to the chaos. I literally did nothing useful and managed
to make other people's lives more difficult for no good reason.

And scholars are free to do this, a right that I do support. They can
publish it under NoArson themselves on their own web page or anywhere they
can get it to. But they certainly can't expect the maintainers of widely
used systems like repositories, aggregators and so many others, to spend
resources on supporting this particular restriction.

If CC-BY works, then just use it. Doing otherwise has a direct negative
impact on the whole of the scholarly world. Forget any hypothetical
problems. When real problems arise, deal with them by actually talking to
the parties involved and starting discussions like this one. Any kind of
restrictive licensing will very, very, very rarely help you and will make
everybody's life more difficult, including yours, ALL the time. So the vast
majority of the time there's just no point in using anything else other
than CC-BY, worried or not.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Thanks Andrew,

I completely concur with your concern.

In my view this is close to breaking Trade Description Acts. If someone
pays for a service they should get it clearly labelled. I have blogged
about this repeatedly - with "OA" papers covered with All rights reserved,
links to RightsLink, etc.

There are legal, ethical and moral duties on publishers. We might have
hoped that in scholarly publishing companies accepted all these as
compelling. Certainly if a scholarly society fails to honour its OA
commitment they are break all three. If a for-profit breaks it then it is a
sad day for the industry. Unfortunately every week is full of sad days.

If we are really fighting the publishing industry some of whom are trying
to take advantage of our goodwill and reluctance to chase this up, then we
need regulation. Regulation that says - you guaranteed to make this Open
Access - there are basic *trading* standards you must adhere to. If it's OA
it must be labelled as such and misleading labels and links should be
removed. Otherwise it's no different from cheap shops offering "free"
products with hidden strings.

IMO the failure to honour the OA contract by mislabelling is far more
serious than "predatory OA publishers"

Well, Heather, there may be an interesting distinction there in how your
derivative is incorrect.

Under CC-BY, if you've modified the work (such as inserting a zero), then
you are required to state that the work has been modified (and even
indicate how). Failure to do so would be a breach of the license.

Furthermore, creating a derivative from a trusted source does not magically
imbue the derivative with trustworthiness. Nobody should ever be trusting a
derivative more than the level of review and checking that the derivative
itself has received.

And in the case of not pre-authorized derivatives, how many derivatives are
authorized based on checking the content of the derivative? In many cases,
it will simply be a purchased right, for a fee.

I have to agree with Mark. The biggest danger with misquoting /
misrepresenting work does not come from pre-authorizing derivatives, it
comes from not being able to check the original source. Whilst that does
not specifically require CC-BY, it does need a minimum of free distribution
and reading. And as that needs to be at least by the time a derivative
appears, it needs / might as well be immediate, and CC-BY,

G

I've been following this discussion with increasing bemusement. Frankly, it's getting ridiculous, at least in my humble opinion. A discussion such as this one about licensing and copyright only serves to demonstrate that copyright, once conceived as a way to stimulate and enable science and the arts, has degenerated into a way to frustrate, derange and debilitate knowledge exchange.

I'm not the first one to point out that absolutely anything, under any copyright licence or none, could be abused for evil purposes or, in more mild circumstances, lead to misunderstandings and accidental abuse. I agree with all those who said it.

The issue here is what science and scientific results stand for. Their purpose is emphatically not "to be copyrightable items". Copyright, invented to combat commercial abuse, has become a means of commercial abuse. The purpose of science and scientific results is to enrich the world's knowledge. Any commercial advantage ? appropriate for industrially funded research ? can be had by 1) keeping results secret (i.e. not publishing them), or 2) getting a patent. Science, particularly modern science, is nothing without a liberal exchange of ideas and information.  

Ideally, scientific publications are not copyrightable at all, and community standards take care of proper acknowledgement. We don't live in an ideal world, so we have to get as close as we can to that ideal, and that is by ameliorating the insidious pernicious effects of copyright with CC-Zero and CC-BY licences.

The existence of the NC rider or stipulation for CC licences is unfortunate and quite damaging. Mainly because of the vagueness and ambiguity of what 'commercial use' means. Ideas in published articles can be freely used for commercial purposes of any kind, as ideas are not copyrightable. Only "the way the ideas have been formulated" is covered by copyright, and thus by the NC clause in copyright licences. In my interpretation that means that most usage of published material that is not a straightforward selling of text or images can be freely done. But that's my interpretation. And that's exactly where it rubs, because all the NC clause does is introduce hypothetical difficulties and liabilities. As a result of which, NC practically means: "stay away from using this material, because you never know with all those predatory legal eagles around". In other words, it's virtually useless for modern, sophisticated scientific knowledge discovery, which doesn't just consist of reading papers any longer, but increasingly relies on the ability to machine-process large amounts of relevant information, as human ocular reading of even a fraction of the information is not possible anymore. At least not in most fast-moving areas of the sciences. Read this article, or similar ones, if you want to be convinced: "On the impossibility of being expert"  BMJ 2010; 341 doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.c6815 (Published 14 December 2010 ? unfortunately behind a paywall).

The taxpayer angle ("must be open because the taxpayer paid for it"), leading to Kent Andersonian notions of knowledge protectionism ("results of research paid by US taxpayers should not be available to non-US citizens unless they pay for it"), is a most unfortunate, visceral and primitive reaction and a complete red herring. For many reasons, not least because the taxpayer, or vicariously the taxman, isn't the party that pockets any money payed for paywalled information. Besides, how far do you go? Americans not being allowed to stay alive due to a cure that was developed with public money in Switzerland unless they pay through the nose for it to the Swiss tax authorities? The "as-long-as-I-am-well-the-rest-of-you-can-go-to-hell" personality disorder. The whole idea is so against the ethos of science that those even thinking in that direction must be taken to be utterly and entirely unsuitable to any role in the scientific community. 

Access control and restriction via copyright was at best a necessary evil in the print era; the 'necessary', though, has disappeared in the web environment.

Have a nice day!

Mike's e-mail to the list falls under copyright, so yes, you could make the argument that I have infringed his rights (both the exclusive right to authorize derivatives and possibly his moral rights). On the other hand, an argument can be made that this use is perfectly legitimate under fair use / fair dealing as quotation for the purpose of criticism.

However, if people are using CC licenses to grant blanket rights to create derivatives of their works to anyone, anywhere, it is possible that people creating adaptations may think they understand the words of the original author but the original author might not agree with their interpretation. I am using this illustration to explain why not every scholar is keen to grant blanket permission to anyone, anywhere to create derivatives of their work.

The proactive encouragement of positive derivatives would seem to be a good
thing.

As for negative derivatives, it still comes back to:

1) Any derivative that does not note that it is a derivative, and does not
note changes (which might be negative) is breaking the terms of the CC-BY
license.

2) Any derivative should also be subject to peer / editorial review in
publication. Allowing a negative derivative at that point would be a fault
of review (not of the original or derivative author).

3) If you trust a known derivative without knowing that it has been
checked, and without checking the source yourself, then that is a fault of
the reader.

You gave an example of "what if the wrong dosage is stated". Well, there
are far more problems that are created in health care by non- or restricted
disclosure of information than could ever be caused by "harmful"
derivatives.

Doctors know how to read literature. What they don't always have is access
to the literature, or effective ways to search it. It can easily be argued
that failing to require CC-BY is leading to more wrongful deaths than
incorrect derivatives which can be checked, rejected and refuted ever could.

And I argue that scholar perception has nothing to do with it. If you are
funding the research, then you have every right to expect that the scholar
publishes in a certain way (e.g. deposit in a repository). And if you are
funding the publication (that is, you are paying the APC) then you have
every right to demand a license that maximizes the value of that
publication.

Nobody is going to continue to demand CC-BY licenses if the risks do
outweigh the benefits. But we can't be paralyzed by inactivity - there are
over 700,000 articles in the Open Access subset of PubMed Central alone,
accumulated over almost 15 years. Has there been any discernible harm from
incorrect derivatives caused by this yet?

I completely agree with all that Jan Velterop said..
copyright has nothing to do in the scientific enterprise today
The benefits of having all information accessible without any restrictions,
and re-usable, the same, are enormous.
When we look at knowledge as something we have to protect, you have to ask
protect from what? From risking the chance that your work is improved by
being licensed under CC-BY?
If I remember correctly Mike Taylor at Berlin11 argued that many more
billions of dollars are in fact wasted by not being able to share
information to the full extent, than can be earned by protecting pieces of
info in order to be able to sell them.
I also particularly oppose the notion of protecting the taxpayers property
in one country from being used freely by citizens in other countries. The
idea of open access restricted to one country is non-sense. How
shortsighted can you be? People playing with these ideas probably
implicitly suppose that their country will produce all (the good science).
The problem with any licenses is that they can be abused and that people
can and will find ways to serve their own interests best. But as said
somewhere in this thread that is not the problem of the licensing, but more
of quality assurance in science.
Having open access CC-BY fully unrestricted , reusable etc in itself
however is not enough to speed up and improve science to the extent
possible, we do need networks (of scientist, citizen scientists) and ways
to access the open access information more easily and efficiently.
for this a service like described by Mark MacGillivray would be great value
and in my view even indispensable As well as the fact that we urgently need
a better framework for quality assurance in science..

But in the wider context, I would not advocate changing the default nature
of copyright protection. I might have a few things to say about how long
you are allowed to assert copyright for, but that's another matter.

For science, having copyright protection is not a bad thing - it's what you
do with it that counts.

Without *any* restriction? That's quite a large brush stroke. I would
certainly advocate that any reasonable use / re-use of a publication should
be permitted, without question or payment. But there are plenty of
unreasonable uses too - not recognizing the original work, not alerting
users to modifications of the work, etc.

You could place the work directly into the public domain, but that may
leave it open to additional risks, with few additional benefits over a
permissive license like CC-BY.

Copyright can still be an important protection, even when you are
permissively licensing the use and re-use of the content in all reasonable
ways.

I am delighted by the breadth of contributors and the intensity of the
discussion. This is not only helping to clarify ideas but also working
towards concrete action. The OKF works to make knowledge open and to make
it useful.

I'm very interested in estimating the cost of research and the cost of not
sharing it. I don't think there are any solid figures, but I'd like to work
with the following:

The human genome cost ca 4 billion USD (spent globally  US, Europe ...) and
yielded ca 800 Billion USD downstream (Battelle's analysis,
http://web.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/publicat/BattelleReport2011.pdf).
That was in considerable part due to the Bermuda principles where all
data were published Openly and immediately. The data were also annotatable
by anyone. Genomes are vastly more valuable when annotated (== derivative
data)

It is difficult to argue hypotheticals but if the knowledge had been
restricted either in scope or speed then the effect would have been much.

The bioscience community has largely not needed licences - it operates
primarily on "community norms" - a set of explicit or implicit principles
where appropriate behaviour is encouraged and non-cooperative behaviour may
result in community reaction - anything from public criticism to
non-refunding of grants. Licences are legal documents and legal action is
almost unknown in this area - thankfully.

The reason that licences are necessary in scholarly articles is that the
primary method of revenue generation for some companies and organisations
is by *restricting* access. In many cases goodwill and community norms have
vanished so the only way forward is legal/contractual. This is regrettable
because it leads to the difficulties we have already seen, but these are
preferable to non-distribution of knowledge or restriction in its use.

I calculate that the opportunity cost of closed access publication runs
into many billions and that the failure to allow - say - unrestricted
text-mining is a considerable part of these costs. I think it's really
important that we try to estimate this and we need to be able to counter
the argument of "everything is OK now and we don't need to change it".

We do need to change it, and massively.

Mark raises relevant questions about the use of posts to this list in a research project.

As it's a little bit off-topic, even considering the general nature of the thread where it appeared (Open Science Anthology published), I renamed it if some wish to go further into this subject.

As in any research-ethics related matter, there is no clear-cut answers to Mark's questions, but rather general principles and guidelines upon which ethical review committees base their analyses and decisions.

In the specific case of posts to forums or discussion lists, these can be:

- The extent to which the forum or list is private (vs public).

- Expectations of the participants about both privacy  and use of their contributions for research purposes?

- Risks (or possible harm) to which participants are or would be subject to if non-anonymized results (not the original posts, but rather their analysis) are made public?

In my opinion (and I must say that I sit on an ethical review committee), it wouldn't be difficult for Mark to convince an ethical review committee that what he intends to do doesn't require participant consent, and maybe not even anonymization.

As to copyright issues, it's true that any text we write, be it a blog post or a 12-volume treatise, is protected by copyright if it's original (I won't enter here into the subtleties of the legal definition of "original").

However, I believe that no authorization is required from the copyright holders (the participants) for this kind of use, considering:

- what would be in fact be retained of the original posts in the final publication;

- exceptions (fair use, fair dealing) or provisions in copyright law concerning the use of copyrighted material for research purposes.

So, I would say that although ethical concerns and copyright matters must be addressed in such a research (as in any other research), they don't necessarily impede the research activity in a significant way.

Things could be different in other seemingly similar situtations, for instance discussion lists about individual health problems. See for instance Eysenbach G. (2001). Ethical issues in qualitative research on internet communities. BMJ, 323, p. 1103. http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.323.7321.1103 (Toll-free).

Subject: Re: [Open-access] [open-science] Open Science Anthology published

I have a particularly relevant example for the members of these lists, in regard to the topic this thread has now focused on.

We have seen in this discussion various points of view about whether or not copyright of various (or any) sorts is good or bad for scholarship.

We have even seen questions arise as to the use of the content of the emails on this thread as sources to quote or derive from.

And we have seen disagreement on whether or not copyright restrictions harms scholarship.


So here is a concrete example:

My current research is about how people access and share information to make decisions. As part of this research, I have taken the public archives of these mailing lists and analysed the interactions between list members, and I would like to publish these analyses in my research. What this means is that the interactions I wish to observe in order to perform my scholarship are interactions that - because of the definition of intellectual property and copyright laws - have been polluted with rights restrictions without the consent of those involved, despite the fact that I can observe these interactions in a public forum and in a public archive with no access restrictions and with no statement of restrictions of any kind.

It therefore seems not only that the output of my research can be placed under restrictions without my consent, but also that the observable events upon which I wish to perform my scholarship can be placed under restrictions with or without consent.


And here are two questions about what I should therefore do next:

If I were to publish my research, including the names of the people involved in the discussions I analysed, would I be breaking the law? If so, need I ask for consent from everyone exposed in the research - despite the fact that they are already observably exposed by having voluntarily contributed to a publicly archived mailing list? If so, why is it that their comments made on a public mailing list using public identifiers and archived in public were put under copyright restriction in the first place?

Secondly, if I were to publish my research but remove all identifying features of the data, would I still need to ask for consent, or am I then just performing an analysis of observable events without making use of the reserved content of those events?


Finally, the key questions:

Is it right that our intellectual property and copyright frameworks should make it possible for people to own the observable events upon which our scholarship must be founded? Does it seem like a good idea, particularly when so much of the interesting interactions between human beings is now taking place in mediums that provide an opportunity to observe and learn far more than we ever have done before, that those same mediums should be the ones to carry such a polluting effect upon the observations we can make?

Regardless of any right that any of us have to protect our works, is that right greater than the right of other scholars to make clear, accurate, comprehensive observations? Should we be free to restrict our works and still claim that we are scholars?

Could it be the case that intellectual property and copyright laws - in their concept, rather than particular formulations of them - are (now) fundamentally incompatible with scholarship?


Please note that these are not questions about privacy or making observations into purposefully hidden events. I am talking here only of observations that are occurring in a public arena, of people performing public actions, without making any effort to hide their identities. Privacy concerns may arguably override any right to make observations, but here I am interested specifically in the cases where such observations are public.

I would greatly appreciate answers to these questions, along with a statement explicitly placing such answers in the public domain so that I may publish my observations and analysis of them in my research findings.

Exactly. The problem we face is that accountants can calculate the
money that's to be made by hiding information, but the enormous
benefits of NOT hiding it are much harder to estimate (and, really,
impossible to know). The cost to worry about in academic publishing is
not subscriptions, page-charges or APC. It's the incredible
opportunity cost of NOT freeing our research.

I don't think anyone really supports this notion. It's a bit of a
straw-horse that people sometimes throw in for rhetorical purposes.
Even Kent Anderson can't actually believe that's a good way to go
(even if it was possible, which it's not).

No evidence for this. Nearly all CC-BY works are available free of cost. CC

Regardless wthat people say Ms. Morrison is spreading misinformation. There
is an immense bulk of CC-BY licensed scholarly articles with authors
apparently having NO concerns with CC-BY.

In the context of commercial publishing NC is a joke because NO re-use is
possible. The hypothetical possibility that someone is selling a work
should be the reason to de facto only grant gratis OA?

This isn't true at least for image re-use.

I am in doubt that nothing can convince Ms. Morrison.

A license can not manage scholarly misconduct. No evidence for harmful

Indeed. The license very clearly states that you, the licensee, "may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits." (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en_US)

Unless all copies of the work vanish from the face of the earth except for the ones remaining in the vault of an evil publisher who then decides to charge for access to the vault, what Heather states above is not possible. And, even in the unlikely scenario I describe, once someone pays for access to the vault and then downloads the work, that work is once again free like the original.

Heather, I know that you believe in open scholarship and want to protect it from possible harm from commercially motivated evil interests, but what you are saying above is simply incorrect.

Very different things. The BOAI is about open access to scientific, scholarly publications. CC-BY is a BOAI-compliant licence that attenuates the damaging power of copyright that is automatically foisted upon any utterance a scientist makes, particularly if written up.

> It is particularly important for open access advocates to be aware that CC licenses, including CC-BY, do not mean that works must be made available free of charge.

This is a very peculiar argument. The CC-BY licence exists to cover an open access, freely available work. It simply makes no sense to attach a CC-BY licence to a work you want to charge for. 
the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and
produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
Just think of the practicalities if you should want to charge. You may even be able to do that once, but since you can't stop further free dissemination in any way, that would be fairly pointless.
 
> CC-BY policy has a huge, potentially systemic loophole: the possibility of re-enclosure.

How would you possibly do that? The licence is irrevocable. Have you heard of the genie and the bottle? Well, it's like that.

They could charge what they want, but they won't be able to stop the material being available for free. 
>

Such exclusive licence to publish is needed for CC-BY-NC, as republishing can be seen as a commercial activity, which is forbidden without a special licence from the copyright holder, who is presumably the author. For a CC-BY licence, such a special licence is vapour and has the value and enforcability of a special licence that allows you to breath air. 
> 
> 3.	There are downsides to permitting commercial re-use that could result in a backlash by researchers. The more that researchers equate OA with CC-BY, the greater the probability that the backlash will be against OA rather than against CC-BY. Recent concerns expressed by scholars about people selling works they have licensed CC-BY should be taken as a reason for caution.

The consequences of profit-spite should be on the researchers own head. Researchers publishing with NC clauses will just have a much greater risk of being ignored, and that risk will increase with the availability of more proper OA (BOAI-compliant, CC-BY).

How would you do proper meta-analyses without 'derivative' rights? How would you do any science without 'derivative' rights? 'Derivative' suffers from the same vagueness and ambiguity as does 'commercial', resulting in FUD which equates to the material being rendered practically useless for proper large-scale modern science.

Let's take a practical, and fairly oft occurring, example, and say that the 'derivative' is translation in another language. Let;s assume a minority language. Euskara, for the sake of the argument. Or Welsh. Or Frisian. Who decides if the 'derivative' is correct? Phantasmagoric, is the word, if I've correctly translated that from the Dutch 'hersenschimmig'.

An authority if there ever was one, of course.

That's like saying the ocean and ships overlap but don't match.

Nobody is forcing CC licences. If anything is 'forced', it is open access. And proper, BOAI-compliant open access just happens to be best covered by a CC-BY or CC-Zero licence. Until an even better licence is formulated.

From time to time I participate in the CC community list and have raised the question about CC and free of charge. The short answer is that there are many people in the Creative Commons community for whom freedom means freedom to put up a paywall and charge for works. Consider the difference between open source software, where the code is free for anyone to manipulate, but software creators are free to charge for the software, and open access with its "free of charge". Klaus, I very much encourage you to sign up for the CC community discussion and check in with them about this question:

There is nothing to stop a downstream user from putting up a paywall before you get to the work. Indeed, it would not be possible to do this, as most of us need to go through a paywall to connect to the internet (whether we or someone else is paying).  We are already seeing that people are using articles to compile books for sale - people have to pay to get the book. 


Perhaps it was another case of premature summary, but you completely missed the subsequent para in my email where I wrote, "Unless all copies of the work vanish from the face of the earth except for the ones remaining in the vault of an evil publisher who then decides to charge for access to the vault, what Heather states above is not possible. And, even in the unlikely scenario I describe, once someone pays for access to the vault and then downloads the work, that work is once again free like the original."

Indeed, if I download your CC BY work, I have all the right in the world (no matter how misplaced one may think it is) to charge for that work. On the other hand, others have all the right in the world to ignore my offering and get your work directly from you or from other sources completely free if it is still available. The only reason a sane person would pay me for an otherwise freely available work is if I add something of value to that work.


Puneet.

We have to understand that putting research results in the public domain is the most effective way of ensuring the free flow of information. CC-BY is a way to secure acknowledgement for researchers, without which the 'system' won't recognise their contributions and they won't be able to make a career out of science. The CC-BY licence does not exist for the sake of the openness of the information it covers, but for the sake of researchers' need for attribution.

What I am, and others are, arguing is that even if a work covered by CC-BY is not made available for free initially, it will be completely free for further distribution subsequently. Thus rather defeating the object of charging the first time around. In a way, you could regard the APC as a charge for that first time around.

No, downstream selling is fine. Anyone can try to sell it. And in some cases that might be beneficial, for instance a local entrepreneur in an emerging economy selling a print version to people without bandwidth or even an internet connection of works that are only electronically available, thus reaching an audience that would not otherwise be reached. An anthology of CC-BY articles brought together in a textbook for use in classrooms in Mongolia, say. Perfectly allowed. What is not allowed is to remove the free availability of the original, CC-BY-covered work, by any legal or technical means.

I am not saying I can prove it, but having thought about this for a few years I do not think that the author needs CC-BY nor any form of insurance that attribution will occur - at least not intrinsically for the sake of the proper functioning of scholarly practice.

I actually agree with you. Attribution is a 'cultural', community custom. CC-BY is only a kind of 'assurance' for authors. People generally want assurances, even though they don't strictly 'need' them. Provenance and attribution are kind of intertwined, though.
Another reason to choose CC-BY over CC-Zero is some assurance for the integrity of the work. Even if you change it, you'd have to cite the original work, so you can't ? theoretically at least ? drift too far from its original content without being found out.

I disagree with Heather's stance and conclusion, but I do very much appreciate her belief in Open as a preferred state of being. I will err to assume our disagreement is based not on dogma but on a misunderstanding of how licenses work and their role as both a legal instrument as well as a sociocultural signal for behavior. From that assumption stems my belief that if I (we) can get our message across constructively and patiently, we will only be doing good service to the cause of open scholarship.

I speak all of the above (and below) for myself, but undoubtedly I am influenced by and influence the organizations I may be associated or employed with.

Dear Heather, I'm not calling you names (unless I totally misunderstand what that expression means in English). What I mean by 'voice in the wilderness' is your nigh biblical passion for a lone position in this discussion.

Best,

Jan

Hi All

I think this particular thread has run its course so I would request that
any focused follow on discussion is started on another thread.
Thanks for posing these questions Heather and feel free to begin another
thread if you feel the list can work towards answering some of them.

Jenny

Hi All

Just a couple of list etiquette points

1) We were far away from the subject line in the previous thread, if those
starting new topics could change this to something more relevant and
reference the original subject it is much easier for subscribers to follow
(or not!) and later to find topics in the list archive. The previous
discussion could have been several distinct threads.

2) There are obviously strong personalities on this list and for that we
are very grateful because it makes for lively discussion about an area
where there is still considerable debate and a lot of thinking to do
(that's why we're all here!). In general you're great at self-regulation
but please bear in mind that if only a few people are contributing and
headway is not being made for whatever reason, it may be time to politely
discontinue, take discussions off-list or start a new thread on a more
constructive topic, citing this reason.

Thanks very much!

Jenny

Question for you:

Are you suggesting that a single entity (e.g. publisher) can take a CC-BY
licensed work, and arbitrarily determine to sell it - in so doing,
eradicate all previously distributed, stored, freely available CC-BY
versions of the same work, such that they can force people into paying for
the version that is being sold?

CC-BY does not prevent somebody from selling a version of the work, but it
does prevent it being sold without acknowledging the CC-BY version, and as
long as you know that there is a CC-BY version, then the only thing that
prevents you from being able to obtain (and use, and re-use) it freely is
carelessness. As long as you take the CC-BY version, and redistribute it -
e.g. via a number of institution or subject repositories - then it will
forever be available at no cost.

Nothing can be done to change that, and it's not simply a theoretical point
- exactly the same conditions have been tested time and time again with
open source software (with derivatives being taken into a commercial
license).

Thanks Jenny,
It's also worth pointing out that there was no need for cross-posting to
two lists (Yes, I was guilty). The last > 50% had no primary relation to
science and it could be off-putting for people wanting to get a feel of how
to start discussions there.

But since there's lots of enthusiasm I'm posting another (topical)
thread.... on content-mining.

on the appropriate list:
https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-contentmining
where we can discuss Elsevier's announcement on content mining

Hello All

Just to highlight this conference and encourage contributions from working
group members - especially those in India as the conference is based in New
Delhi!

Do use the list as a sounding board for session ideas or to find
collaborators and fellow organisers if you feel it would be helpful. We'd
also be delighted if anyone attending would be prepared to blog or tweet
from the event for us as I'm sure the topics covered will be of interest to
many in the working group.

If enough people are going, we can try and arrange an open science meetup
during the event.

Subject: Call for SciDataCon 2014 International Scientific Programme
Committee Candidates
To: DATA-PUBLICATION at jiscmail.ac.uk



*CODATA (ICSU's Committee on Data for Science and Technology)
http://www.codata.org <http://www.codata.org> and the ICSU World Data
System http://www.icsu-wds.org <http://www.icsu-wds.org> are collaborating
to organise a joint conference, SciDataCon 2014
http://www.scidatacon2014.org <http://www.scidatacon2014.org> in New Delhi
on 2-5 November 2014.   *
Highlighting the theme of 'Data Sharing and Integration for Global
Sustainability', this will be a major international conference addressing
various issues relating to data and international research.

*CODATA and WDS invite applications for expert members of the International
Scientific Programme Committee.  Further details are below and in a pdf
attachment.  Please submit applications no later than 14 February 2014
using the online form
at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hie81RpuLZZLK-9V1MR9fanSr7d1MxcnXyvNNdWVgaA/viewform
<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hie81RpuLZZLK-9V1MR9fanSr7d1MxcnXyvNNdWVgaA/viewform>*

With very best wishes,

Simon Hodson, Executive Director CODATA, and Mustapha Mokrane, Executive
Director WDS.

*SciDataCon 2014: Invitation for International Scientific Programme
Committee Candidates*

*Below is the text of the Call for Candidates issued jointly by CODATA and
ICSU-WDS. *
Dear Colleagues,

Data are essential to all scientific endeavours. The emerging cultures of
data sharing and publication, open access to, and reuse of data are
positive signs of an evolving research environment. Nevertheless, several
cultural and technological challenges are still preventing the scientific
and research community from realizing the full benefits of these trends.

The *Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA)*
http://www.codata.org and the *World Data System (WDS)*
http://www.icsu-wds.org, interdisciplinary bodies of the
International Council for Science (ICSU) http://www.icsu.org are supporting
and encouraging these positive changes by actively promoting effective data
policies and good data management practices in the scientific and research
community, to produce better science, which ultimately benefits society.
Likewise, the challenges and opportunities of 'Big Data' may have
ramifications for the conduct of science: the value and importance of data
are being recognized more than ever before.

As a major contribution to this effort, the two organizations are
co-sponsoring and organizing a high profile international biennial
conference on scientific research data. SciDataCon will provide a unique
platform bringing together international experts and practitioners in data
sciences, technologies and management; researchers from the natural,
social, health and computer sciences, and from the humanities; research
funders; policy makers and advisors.

The sustainability challenges facing society today cannot be solved without
multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research on global sustainability
that requires the use, sharing and integration of data across scientific
disciplines and domains and from international sources. The effectiveness
and credibility of this research will rely on the availability to
the scientific and research community of quality-assessed and interoperable
datasets.

To facilitate the work of international research undertakings--including the
Future Earth international research programme on global sustainability
launched by ICSU and its partners in 2014--and amplify the message of
like-minded global data initiatives promoting data sharing and
interoperability--including the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and the
recently established Research Data Alliance (RDA)--SciDataCon 2014
http://www.scidatacon2014.org will highlight the theme of Data Sharing and
Integration for Global Sustainability.

*The conference will take place on 2-5 November 2014 in New Delhi,
India and will be hosted by the Indian National Science Academy.* With
high-level keynotes, a mix of plenary and parallel sessions, and a
stimulating poster session, SciDataCon is conceived as a focussed--yet
inclusive--conference to address the issues most important to the global
scientific and research community as they pertain to data and information.
The International Scientific Programme Committee will play a key role in
implementing the scientific programme with innovative online consultation
and input from research and data science communities worldwide.


*We invite applications for expert members of the International Scientific
Programme Committee.  Please submit applications no later than 14 February
2014 using the online form available here:

Hello All,

As I am near to Delhi, I would like to attend this Conference. Being a
scientist from Agricultural Sciences, I would like to talk on behalf of
Open Data in Agricultural Sciences.

I hope many who are in this list from India would also be interested to
attend the conference.

Any joint proposals?? count me in...

Thanks & Regards
Sridhar

Hi Jenny!

Thanks for the summary :)

I've translated your message into Portuguese, it's now on the Brazilian
working group's blog, I'm hoping it will attract more volunteers:

http://www.cienciaaberta.net/relato-do-grupo-de-trabalho-global-em-ciencia-aberta/

((I wonder if there are people from other Portuguese speaking countries
on this list.))

Beyond the BR WG stuff, I might volunteer myself to help with open
science manuals globally if no one else shows up, though I still got to
check with some other commitments I've made this semester. :|

Cheers, - I should go make some tea now...

Subject: [open-science] H2020 Open Access Guideline:
Message-ID: <52EB10A0.7090606@stefankasberger.at>

hey,

i've made some short research about the H2020 Open Access mandate, and
unfortunately all I found was not satisfying. as read in this document
http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf
the framework defines open access only in access, not in rights to use.

page 6:
"In order to comply with this requirement, beneficiaries must,at the
very least, ensure that their publications, if any,can be read online,
downloaded and printed. However, as any additional rights such as the
right to copy, distribute, search, link, crawl, and mine increase the
utility of the accessible publication, beneficiaries should make every
effort to provide for as many of them as possible."

do I get something wrong, or was the open access thing all the time not
compliant with the opendefinition? thought this will also include
stringent copyrights and mandatory real open access policy. sadly it
seems not so...

cheers, stefan

Yeah, that is what happens if such a clear definition is missing.
Reading your quote from the "mandate" does not surprise me, and if in
2020 everything must be Open Access in this way, we have merely waited
6 years...

We have a lot of educating to do still....

In page 2 there is a definition of open access:
"Open access can be defined as the practice of providing on-line access to
scientific information that is free of charge to the end-user and that is
re-usable."

However, the mandate or requirement of the Comission includes the "green
road", that is not actually "open" because publishers limit the reuse

That is a consequence of puting so many labels to the concept "open access"
Currently we have green, golden, platinium... and in my opinion we have
lost the real definition or the ultimate goal.

Quite so. What matter is basically just these user rights:

- redistribution
- modification
- sell it

It's really not that hard, but still too many people can mess it up.
The "sell it" is bascially the omission of NC clauses, which have an
unclear legal status. Is a private university that sells education
(high education fees) commercial or not?

Hi,

sorry for the delay, but two weeks ago I already get in touch with Sophie Kay to
starting translate her amazing course into portuguese. I didn't start yet due
technical problems.

Please let me know the news related to the Open Science Training so I can help.

OKFN has good relations with EC staff, I am not sure whether we have
formally communicated this issue to them. On "Open-Access" (Licences for
Europe) we have been fighting a battle to be allowed to mine content
without explictly requesting permissions (The right to read is the right to
Mine). This was bitterly contested by publishers. The current position is
that the proposed "licence" approach will not go forward (good) and that we
shall need to find another way. I think any careful submissions on this
will carry weight with the Commission.

May be related. The OKFN is having an Editathon in a week to improve the
OKF wiki. This could be an opportunity for us to attend to the Science
pages. There's an Etherpad at:

http://pad.okfn.org/p/okfwiki

I have signed up.

To respond to the conversation about the H2020 OA guidelines, OpenAIRE has been supporting the FP7 OA mandate for some years now,  and while we have had some say in suggesting that all content should be as openly licensed as possible, there are some reservations as to mandating this from the EC perspective (mainly political, since there is a lot of aligning to do in national policies). We realize more can be done on this front and we continue to push for such open licenses, certainly at the point of origin (e.g. providing advice to researchers, repository managers, research admins, publishers and others).
I'd like also to point readers on the list to a recently published legal study which is a very thorough examination of the legal rights in reusing research data  and is especially useful for open access infrastructures and providers to know to what extent they are allowed to gather, expose, and reuse  data. The resounding conclusion is for a community-wide push for a CC 4.0 licensing framework. The EC have supported this study, which will certainly have some impact on the future licensing decisions they take.  We strongly believe that this study can be a useful awareness tool as we collectively approach any decision makers. The links to the study and summaries can be found here: http://www.openaire.eu/en/component/content/article/9-news-events/515-safe-to-be-open-openaire-legal-study-has-been-published

Betreff: Re: [open-science] H2020 Open Access Guideline:

OKFN has good relations with EC staff, I am not sure whether we have formally communicated this issue to them. On "Open-Access" (Licences for Europe) we have been fighting a battle to be allowed to mine content without explictly requesting permissions (The right to read is the right to Mine). This was bitterly contested by publishers. The current position is that the proposed "licence" approach will not go forward (good) and that we shall need to find another way. I think any careful submissions on this will carry weight with the Commission.

Quite so. What matter is basically just these user rights:

- redistribution
- modification
- sell it

It's really not that hard, but still too many people can mess it up.
The "sell it" is bascially the omission of NC clauses, which have an
unclear legal status. Is a private university that sells education
(high education fees) commercial or not?
