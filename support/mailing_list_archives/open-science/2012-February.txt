Message-ID: <4F31428C.9030806@sub.uni-goettingen.de>

** Apologies for cross-posting **

OpenAIRE has recently released its "Studies on Subject-Specific 
Requirements for Open Access Infrastructure". Designed as a comparative 
study covering five disciplines (Health, Climate, Agriculture, ICT, 
e-infrastructures) it provides in-depth insight into researchers' 
behaviour and current practices. With a focus on research workflows, 
literature and data management the case studies address key questions on 
how subject-specific needs can be represented in an Open Access 
infrastructure. Moreover, each case study provides a vision and 
principles for future information services to further exploit OA 
principles from a disciplinary perspective as well as advices to future 
directions for funding agencies.

The study is available both as an ebook and in individual chapters, 
consisting of an introduction, six subject-specific case studies from 
highly qualified subject specialists and a comparative conclusion.

About OpenAIRE
OpenAIRE (Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe) is a 3-year 
European Commission (EC) funded initiative that supports the 
implementation of the EC's Open Access Pilot and the European Research 
Council's Guidelines for Open Access. Together with the recently 
launched OpenAIREplus project both initiatives work towards the goal to 
develop an Open Access participatory infrastructure for scientific 
information.

Subject: [open-science] Citizen Cyberscience Hackday
Message-ID: <CABPM+wpRgkbhDMXU6teVYGRez6xZTh572c=ttdq9AZyng5Vv2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

If anyone can make it to London on Saturday 18th Feb the Citizen
Cyberscience Summit is hosting a hackday
http://cybersciencesummit.org/35-2/the-hackday/ featuring multiple
challenges http://cybersciencesummit.org/challenges/ including one focused
around PyBOSSA which was developed by OKFN folk:

---------------
Create your own volunteer thinking project with PyBossa
http://cybersciencesummit.org/portfolio/create-your-own-volunteer-thinking-project-with-pybossa/
Develop volunteer thinking projects based on the new open source PyBossa
platform that the Citizen Cyberscience Centre has developed with the Open
Knowledge Foundation.Do you have a project where you need human
collaboration? Humans are very capable of reading handwritting, identifying
objects in pictures, doing transcriptions, thinking in 3D, collaborating,
etc. For instance, if we ask a person if he can see a human in a photo it
will be easy to answer, but it could be complicated for an algorithm.
________

Another suggested challenge encourages non-coders to add information on
citizen cyberscience projects to Data Hub so strong OKFN involvement would
be fantastic to see!

"How many citizen cyberscientists are there in the world?"* *
Participants in this challenge will  hunt down and enter relevant data
about the numbers of citizen cyberscientists participating in various
projects, in an effort to quantify the level of citizen cyberscience
worldwide. Data will be stored and visualized using OKFN's DataHub. The
core challenge of gathering and entering data is suitable for participants
who are not major league hackers. For participants with relevant software
skills, the work can extend to developing ways of automating data
collection from sites that publish citizen cyberscience stats regularly (eg
BOINCstats).
------------

Do you have ideas for further challenges? Send them to the list and we'll
forward them to the summit team.

You can register for the hackday and the rest of what looks set to be a
fantastic event here: http://cybersciencesummit.org/register-2/ - drop me a
line if you're going and especially if you have experience with
CKAN/DataHub and would be willing to assist with the challenges!

Best wishes

Jenny

Hi all,

** The application deadline for the Panton Fellowships is 24th February.
Visit the Panton Principles
website<http://pantonprinciples.org/panton-fellowships/>for details **

Panton Fellowships offer *?8,000 *to scientists who promote open data in
science. Fellowships can be held whilst you are working or studying, and
should supplement your current funding.

Fellowships last for one year. The scheme is designed to be flexible, and
there is scope for Fellows to carry out a range of activities. Fellows may
wish to:

* Initiate discussion about the role and value of openness,
* Explore practical solutions for making data open
* Catalyse the scientific community and for push change.

Panton Fellowships are open to all, and are particularly suited to graduate
students and early-stage career stage scientists. The scheme is overseen by
a distinguished Advisory Board of scientists and open data advocates.

Panton Fellowships are not intended to cover full economic costs, and are
not full-time positions. Fellows should continue to work and/or study at
their current institution for the duration of the Fellowship. You should
ensure that you have permission from employers/funders before applying.

Applicants should send a CV and covering letter to jobs [@] okfn.org by
*24th February*. In your covering letter, you should explain as a Panton
Fellow, what you would do, make or change.

To be eligible, applicants must have the relevant rights to work in the UK,
and should reasonably expect to be working and/or studying in the UK until
March 2013.

See the Panton Principles
website<http://pantonprinciples.org/panton-fellowships/>for full
details. If you have any questions, please contact laura.newman
[@] okfn.org.

Please circulate this email to any relevant mailing lists, and to anyone
who may be interested.

	March, London
Message-ID: <CABPM+wqwqb2fk+Yju-eEmaGs2hWYuifv9_1oncH6HnzP=sAaiw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

At the last working group meeting it was decided that we should run a
hackday on open science, spending the day driving forward coding projects
and coming up with new ideas.
So, come along and join us in person in the London Barbican foyer or
virtually via Skype, IRC and Etherpad!

There are several tasks which don't require the ability to programme so
don't be put off if you're not a coder, we'd still love to have you along!
All that's required is enthusiasm and interest.

Date: Saturday 31 March 2012
Time: 10am to 6pm (and later for those who want to carry on)
Location: Barbican Foyer and online
Sign up for numbers here: http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-mar12

Possible ideas we could work on are below, although feel free to add some
to the pad linked above or bring your own on the day and we'll pick a few
to focus on:
- Open Research Reports (continuation of work from SWAT4LS hackathon).
- Generating a Data Watch website.
- Pulling data from citizen cyberscience projects straight into CKAN.

Hope to see you soon!

Jenny

My big plan is to work to upgrade data digitizer to be a proper table
transcription system.

Can I suggest you boot an issue on the issue tracker where we can
discuss and plan this work:

Hi All

Just a reminder that the Citizen Cyberscience Summit kicks off tomorrow!
There are a few tickets remaining for the plenary day at the Royal
Geographical Society, the Friday Session is sold out but you can still
register for the hackday on Saturday. All tickets available here
http://cybersciencesummit.org/register-2/

Two challenges relate to OKFN projects (you can see the complete list and
more details here http://cybersciencesummit.org/challenges/ )
---------------
Create your own volunteer thinking project with PyBossa
http://cybersciencesummit.org/portfolio/create-your-own-volunteer-thinking-project-with-pybossa/
Develop volunteer thinking projects based on the new open source PyBossa
platform that the Citizen Cyberscience Centre has developed with the Open
Knowledge Foundation.Do you have a project where you need human
collaboration? Humans are very capable of reading handwritting, identifying
objects in pictures, doing transcriptions, thinking in 3D, collaborating,
etc. For instance, if we ask a person if he can see a human in a photo it
will be easy to answer, but it could be complicated for an algorithm.
________

*How many cyberscientists can you count?*
Search and gather data about the world?s Citizen Cyberscientists, to be
stored in the OKF Data Hub.* *There are many brilliant cyberscience
projects out there but they are widely dispersed. The Challenge is to
search and gather relevant data about the numbers of citizen
cyberscientists participating in various projects, in an effort to quantify
the level of citizen cyberscience worldwide.
------------
If you can't attend in person but would like to participate in the
challenges above remotely either on Friday afternoon or Saturday, fill in
your details here and we'll make sure you have the links to the challenge
documentation and are in contact with someone at the hackday:
http://okfnpad.org/cccs2012-hackday

Subject: [open-science] Response to Hargreaves proposal on copyright reform
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Nu2YoM8OqmT-X96-Br86CBrWgFWxpCju946yyJ1ehCmA@mail.gmail.com>

Ben Hawes from the Uk's Intellectual Property Office (ipo.gov.uk) picked up
my blogging on problems of textmining and invited me to IPO in Bloomsbury -
we talked for about an hour. Ben is formally neutral but wants to see
cogent arguments from the Open community that can be included in a
response. Briefly the Hargreaves report has recommended changes to UK
copyright law which inter alia would allow text- and data-mining for NC
uses. (The NC comes from European law - if we feel strongly (as I do) then
it's worth pursuing it).  The response will be collated by IPO, offered for
public consultation and then drafted for legislative changes.

I THINK IT'S CRITICAL THAT THE OKF RESPOND - we have till March 21. - see
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/consult-2011-copyright.pdf

Although this is a UK activity it will probably have important impact
esleweher in Europe which - as far as I know - is not as far down this road.

I'v copied 3 lists. It's not just science, but that's an important area and
has the features that none of the work is for profit - this may be
self-evident to us, but the point needs making. I've included discuss, to
pick up general views. It also overlaps with current thinking on access.
We'll need to identify a coordination mechanism soon.

Hi,

sorry if I'm spreading old news but I couldn't find any mention
of this on the list so maybe people find this interesting:

http://scoap3.org/

SCOAP^3 - Sponsoring Consortium for Open Access Publishing in Particle 
Physics <http://scoap3.org/index.html>
Towards Open Access publishing in High Energy Physics

While limited in scope to high energy physics I think the
business model can serve as role model for other fields
as well - if not the future of scientific publishing in general.

Hi all,

does anyone here have some experience with the legal interpretation of
the ShareAlike clause of the Creative Commons licenses?

In particular, I was wondering if the SA that applies to derivatives,
works like the copylefting in the GNU GPL, or as in the GNU *Affero*
GPL?

The context is data behind a website providing functionality based on
that data (for example, any website that allows you to search that
data, visualize slices, etc). Now, I am not interested into getting
into the argument that data should not be using CC-SA at all, and just
face CC-SA data, where this issue comes up.

IANAL but there's a fundamental problem here. You can ask two different questions here. One is what is the legal position? This will differ by jurisdiction but basically hasn't been tested anywhere I am aware of for data. The likely case is that a court would through out a case based on CC-BY-SA for Darwin most jurisdictions. In any case it would be a mess and difficult to predict.

The other question is what is the intention? Well the drafters of the SA licence didn't want to consider data really so in a sense their intentions aren't relevant. If you look closely at the CC terms in 3.0  you will see that people are largely giving any non copyright rights up, which doesn't leave much for data. So then you're reduced to respecting what you think the wishes of the data providers are. So you can either ask them, or take the most conservative path, erring on e side of caution. I would guess that when people apply SA terms what they mostly are thinking of is GPL style protections.

It would be great if you could document what you end up doing and why. We need real stories of how these different licensing choices interact with reality so we can stop talking so much about abstract possibilities and look at real evidence when we encourage people to take certain approaches.

Cheers

We already have asked to providers, but that is kind of asking for
additional rights... so, my question is indeed a bit theoretical, and
I am seeking real-world stories indeed. I will document whatever
replies I get.

> I would guess that when people apply SA terms what they mostly are thinking of is GPL style protections.

Yes, but like GPL *or* like Affero GPL...

The difference for source code is tremendous... the GPL is only
"infectious" if the software is distributed. So, what people started
doing was take GPL software, host that online, modify and improve, but
not share those improvements. Since they are not distributing the
software, they are not required to open source their improvemens.
That's what the "Affero GPL", ummm, solves.

Now, the same can happen to data. Someone picks up some CC-SA database
from chemistry, host this, enrich that with cool new stuff, fixing
typos in the original database... but, would those typo fixes need to
be shared under CC-SA?

Possible answers:

Yes, SA works like the Affero GPL.
No, they are not redistributing the data as such, and the SA bit does not apply.

I can imagine many answers, and many intentions. But what I am looking
for mostly, is how others have put the SA clause into practice.

> It would be great if you could document what you end up doing and why. We need real stories of how these different licensing choices interact with reality so we can stop talking so much about abstract possibilities and look at real evidence when we encourage people to take certain approaches.

Yes, and those stories I am indeed seeking :)

But, given the state of Open Data, I am a bit skeptic in getting any
reply at all :/

Hi,

For all the Polish-speaking memers of this list (are there any others?), here is a new petition organized by Warsaw University/ICM, calling for the open publication of publically funded research:
http://otwartymandat.pl/

Unfortunately, there is no English translation yet.

Thanks for the share. It's already a big news in academic circles.

To make it clear for non-Polish members - it's not a petition for some
precise solution (it calls for open mandate without specifying any
details). It's rather an attempt to start a final (see below)
discussion on the subject (using petition authors' report on OA -
which is probably the best publication in Polish on the subject that
was released so far - as a starting point).

For those of you who are not familiar with OA subject in Poland,
here's a piece of a bigger picture: there's an ongoing discussion on
nation-wide OA mandate (or/and its field-specific versions similar to
NIH mandate) since 2009. A proposal of a legislation never reached the
green table (for reasons you are all too familiar with: variations of
disagreement on gold vs green), however already twice the office of PM
introduced into different legislations requirement for open PhD
theses. Respective paragraphs were removed before the voting due to
resistance of academic community (PhD students especially). In the
meantime, during signing a new "big deal", Ministry of Science agreed
to cover Springer Open Choice fee on each publication from Polish
institution (if applicable). However, no news yet on covering the PLoS
or BMC fees. The current atmosphere suggests that some decisions are
going to be made relatively soon - even economists are calling for OA
(more specifically: for OA plus open data).

Best wishes
PS

Dear All

Info on an event on scientific publishing in Oxford featuring Cameron
Neylon and with myself and Peter Murray-Rust in the audience - if you're
available please do come along and let us know so we can make sure to say
hi!

If not, I'll let you all know when the video is out. There is a flyer
available at www.EvolutionOfScience.org<https://legacy.nexus.ox.ac.uk/OWA/redir.aspx?C=46bfecd718d541d69c2d536cf84bc33a&URL=http%3a%2f%2fwww.EvolutionOfScience.org>
if
you happen to be in a position to post it somewhere.

Jenny


On leap-Wednesday the 29th Feb, a rare chance to meet an eminent panel of
speakers and debate

The Scientific Evolution: Open Science and the Future of Publishing

The panel includes speakers from Nature, Elsevier, and the Wellcome trust,
together with Lord Robert Winston, Cameron Neylon and Victor Henning, CEO
of Mendeley.

We'll address question like,
Do we still need science journals in the internet age?
Is there something better than peer review?
How will scientific papers evolve?
Is the Elsevier boycott (thecostofknowledge.com) the start of something big?

The change has already begun: SOPA and the RWA, the boycott of Elsevier.
Science is evolving to become more open. How will you make the most of the
change? Come to discover, to debate, and come to take action.

Something dodgy happen with the link to the website there, the URL

Do any of you know of a journal that recently switched from
toll-access to open access and may be in a position to provide a

Does  it have to be a journal that switched? Or do you just want CTAs under
Open licences (for the CTAs)? I wouldn't have thought that was too difficult

Hi Daniel,

See the Open Access Directory list of journals that converted from TA to OA.
http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Journals_that_converted_from_TA_to_OA

The list is fairly comprehensive but not completely current. For more
recent conversions, see the items tagged with "oa.conversions" for the OA
Tracking Project.

Thanks, Peter - this list is instructive, especially in the cases
where some explanation is provided for the conversion. Nothing sprang
to mind in terms of illustration, though.

The movie itself has no declaration of rights (unless I have missed it).
Embedding the movie in Wikimedia pages is fragile declaration of rights. A
simple CC-BY or CC0 on the credits is needed.

We discussed this on open-access meetup yesterday. Can we come up with a
simple digital means for stamping images and movies as CC-BY/0/PDDL? It's
not difficult to see how it could be done for images (create a bitmap,
replace the pixels with "@access CC0" or whatever. I'm sure I'm not the
first to think of it.

Not sure whether I follow you, Peter - surely, embedding on a
Wikimedia page doesn't say much about copyright and licensing terms,
but if you click on the video's preview image (rather than the play
button), you are brought to the page with the metadata. That is
standard on MediaWiki, and I thought you were aware of that.
Or what am I missing?

The video has been taken down as a supposed copyright violation,
primarily because of unclear provenance.

It is still cached at http://www.webcitation.org/65hebsXVT (just viewed it 10 secs ago), and, it is quite nice actually. In vein of those Geico commercials.

Just slap a CC0 banner on top (easy to do with home movie programs such as iMovie) and put it up again.

Really nice job.

Hi all,

In one of our national newspapers Volkskrant of today I read an article on
the new company United Academics, who want to build communities of
scientists with their own lit databases and new models of publication. It
has to grow into a facebook for scientists.
There is at least one comparable company ReserchGate, as far as I know
Our ideas (@ccess) of building communities are different as we don't focus
on scientists only. But we do want to build communities, implement new
publishing systems, provide platforms for interaction. provide access to as
much information as possible. For all this we have the poassible
collaboration in the Github Science projectand the new Bibsoup system,  big
advantages.
When entrepreneurs are seeing possibilities, I am the more convinced that
we have something going that can become very successful indeed

Hi Bjoern,

more or less, yes. They () have clearly as a main objective to do
business.and see opportunities.
As long as we have the better cards, as I think we have, it's OK. We should
be careful however to guard some of the less developed ideas that we just
started working on.

Next twist to the story - the file has now been nominated for deletion:
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Deletion_requests/File:Scientist-meets-publisher-English.ogv

Could it be that Alex didn't have the right to release the video under
CC0 if it was produced using the Xtranormal software, even though he
paid for using it?

Xtranormal's terms of service are at http://www.xtranormal.com/tos/ .

Regrettably, it looks like that's the case. Note that it's not just
produced using Xtranormal software, it's produced using their
characters, scenes, animations, and voices. I imagine all those
elements are subject to copyright, so you only have what rights they
grant you:

"As a Commercial User, you are granted a limited, non-exclusive,
revocable, non-transferable right to create, display, use, play and
download Xtranormal Videos during the Term and within the Scope of
Use:..."

Clearly that grant isn't sufficient to release the result as CC0.

I asked them yesterday:

So did Alex, I think.
No reply either way so far.

Hi Open Science,

A few weeks ago Creative Commons submitted the CC0 license to the Open
Source Initiative (OSI) for approval as an open source license.  Three days
ago they withdrew the application after concerns that it's fallback licence
explicitly stated that it refers to copyright, not patents,  (section 4a).
 I am forwarding their withdrawal message below.  The full thread can be
found on the OSI archive:
http://projects.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-February/

I think this is very unfortunate. I do not know of a widely recognized open
source license that is appropriate to share data, code, figures,
documentation and text may be found in a single object, such as my lab
notebook, R packages, or dynamic document (in which code and data are
embedded).

Subject: [License-review] CC withdrawl of CC0 from OSI process
To: license-review at opensource.org


Hello all,

We've discussed this internally, and unfortunately we agree that it's
best to withdraw CC0 from the OSI review process at this time.  There
have been several issues raised around the language declaring patents
out of scope in the tool (that they weaken equitable estoppel defenses
against patents or that they heighten risk by putting someone "on
notice" about patent risks in the associated code).

There have been questions about why that lanugage is there.  First of
all, speculation that we did not anticipate CC0 usage for software at
the time is true.  The patent language that exists comes out of
conversations with the scientific data community, whom were a large
target of adoption for the tool.  This community felt strongly that
there was a need to clearly waive something into the public domain
without also waiving patents in the process.  Hence the language.

It has been suggested that CC simply remove this text from the CC0
legalcode.  This would of course require releasing a new version, as
we can't change the 1.0 legalcode once it has been released.
Unfortunately, even doing a small versioning of something with as
straightforward of an action as this is not as simple as it might
sound.  First of all, releasing a new version of a legal tool,
including CC0, requires a large conversation between many parties and
experts, and thus inevitably is not a quick task.  On top of this, the
CC 4.0 process is in full swing, and there is not enough bandwidth
within the organization to do a CC0 revisioning at the same time.
Thus, beginning the process for a new version of CC0 would have to
wait until CC 4.0 is out, which means that won't start until at
least 2013.

That said, this experience has certainly been informative, and will be
taken into consideration in possible future CC0 versioning, should
that happen.
