Subject: Work/Hack session on LODD / IsItOpenData
To: public-semweb-lifesci at w3.org


Hi all,

on February 16 there was an OpenScience Workgroup [0] meeting of the
Open Knowledge Foundation, where we scheduled a work session for
Monday March 7th at 19:00 GMT, for about an hour, to work on
clarifying the data licensing of LODD data sets, such as those listed
on CKAN. For some data sets the license is clear, others have
non-commercial clauses (which is not considered "Open Data"), and
others do not specify the terms, or are not open at all. For example,
the below diagram a CAS node which is not open data at all:

http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG/LODD/Data

In fact, the unclear license issue was one of the referee comments on
the LODD contribution to the thematic issue on RDF in chemistry
(coordinated by Matthias).

Please let me know if interested in joining the meeting,

Egon

Great thanks for your support Egon! We'll certainly bear this in mind
when drafting the application - and make sure we explicitly mention
open data in science as an area where we may have mentors and would be
interested in doing something! :-)

Dear All

We had a very productive hack session on Monday night regarding linked open
drug data. You can see the full notes here:
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-loddhack-201103

In summary, we reviewed the openness of several LODD data sets in CKAN and
identified those whose maintainer's should be sent an Is It Open Data?
request. We drafted letters  to send to the World Health Organisation Global
Health Observatory and the maintainers of two datasets at the US National
Library of Medicine:
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-who-letter
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-rxnorm-letter
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-nlm-letter

Before we send them via http://www.isitopendata.org/, it would be great to
get more signatories from the group, so please add your name to the end of
the generic letter on http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-loddhack-201103 if you
are happy to be included. Unfortunately, we didn't remind all of the hack
session participants to do this before they left, so if you helped on Monday
then please do sign!

We will be sending the letters on Monday 14th March during a follow up
session, of which more details are to follow.

If there is a group on CKAN, or a general topic area that you feel would be
a good target for future sessions of this nature, then please let me know!

Hi,

I am a PhD student at the University of Leipzig working with the AKSW group
[1] and as part of my project [2], we converted the WHO-GHO dataset to RDF.

To answer the question about the licensing/copyright issue, according to
WHO, if extracts from WHO website of publication are used for research,
private study or in a noncommercial document with limited circulation (such
as an academic thesis or dissertation), then it is allowed to do so without
seeking permission [3]. WHO encourages the use of its information materials
for information purposes i.e. when the purpose of the use is to share
objective information, whether free of charge or for sale. Only if the
material is to be used for commercial purposes, it requires a license.
However it does have a copyright notice: Copyright World Health Organization
(WHO), 2011. All Rights Reserved [4], so maybe this copyright could be
added.

Also, the dataset is available at this SPARQL endpoint:
http://db0.aksw.org:8895/sparql and can be downloaded from here:
http://aksw.org/Projects/Stats2RDF#h13390-5 .

Hope that is sufficient information regarding the open-ness of the dataset.
Let me know if any other information is required and suggestions are welcome
:)

That leaves three datasets where we have not been able to find a clear
licensing/copyright/waiver statement, and for these three letters are
now written, see Jenny's email, to inquire under what conditions those
data sets can be redistributed, which the LODD wg is already doing.
This involves DailyMed, RXNorm, and the WHO-GHO data sets. Input from
those who composed is helpful here. One thing that we want to get
clear is if people can pull the data from the SPARQL end point,
use/modify it, and even redistribute it.


Thank you.
Regards,
Amrapali J Zaveri

First of all, thanx for sending these pointers!

If I read this, however, I am tempted to think that this data is
really not Open. Making the whole available as RDF does not sounds to
me as 'extracts' or 'limited circulation' to me...

Yes.

Have you asked permission to 'circulate' the whole of the database?

I think Jenny and I will have to update the letter with respect to
these new details, and I'm really happy you pointed me to [3].

Hmm, since GHO is only one of the WHO datasets and also the RDF data *
currently* only contains the "Mortality and Burden of Disease" data, we
considered to be an extract but maybe you are right. We do intend to convert
the entire dataset too.

Since it is for non-commerical purposes, we haven't asked for permission
yet. They have this form for the request for permission:
http://www.who.int/about/licensing/copyright_form/en/index.html which I'll
fill out.

Dear All

See below for a summary of key points from the WG meeting on Feb 16 2011,
followed by a list of interesting events that are coming up. If you?d like
more detailed updates on projects or to view the full minutes, visit the
meeting Etherpad at http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-9Mar2011.
The next meeting will be Wednesday 13th April, 17:30 GMT. You can sign up
and add agenda items here http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-13Apr2011.

UPDATES:

LODD hack session (Mon 7th March):
This was very productive, with 12 datasets reviewed and three Is It Open
Data? requests drafted. Please see the notes here
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-loddhack-201103 and here
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2011-March/000663.html and sign
the Is It Open Data? request if you wish.

OKF Science home page:
Amrapali distributed some brilliant word cloud 'Wordle' images, one of which
will be replacing the picture on http://science.okfn.org/ very soon. We will
also be embedding a calendar listing meeting dates and open data in science
relevant talks and events. More details on contributing events to follow!

If you haven't done so already, please register on the OKFN Wordpress site
at http://okfn.org/register and join the Science group. Then, if you'd like
to be able to post stuff on http://science.okfn.org/, such as event
announces, blog posts on open data in science related issues or other
updates then email me to be added to the list of blog authors. It would be
brilliant to get some more content up that really reflects the great work
members of the group are doing and flags up things others might be
interested in.

Panton Principles:
Writing of the Panton Papers remains underway. There was a suggestion in the
12th Jan meeting of having a list of best practice case studies; people,
projects or papers which are putting the Panton Principles into action.
Please contribute to suggestions or compose a short paragraph on your
favourite example here:
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-PPcasestudies

Is It Open Data?: http://www.isitopendata.org/
Many requests have now been made, and it would be great to improve the site
and add extra features for users. If you have some Python. HTML, CSS or
similar coding skills, we need your assistance!
Please get in touch if you would be interested in helping out, there may be
a discussion happening on Friday about what could be improved.

Also, if you have made an enquiry, please make sure you revisit to flag up
it's status as resolved or not (or one of the other options available).

Subject: Work/Hack session on LODD / IsItOpenData
To: public-semweb-lifesci at w3.org


Hi all,

on February 16 there was an OpenScience Workgroup [0] meeting of the
Open Knowledge Foundation, where we scheduled a work session for
Monday March 7th at 19:00 GMT, for about an hour, to work on
clarifying the data licensing of LODD data sets, such as those listed
on CKAN. For some data sets the license is clear, others have
non-commercial clauses (which is not considered "Open Data"), and
others do not specify the terms, or are not open at all. For example,
the below diagram a CAS node which is not open data at all:

http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG/LODD/Data

In fact, the unclear license issue was one of the referee comments on
the LODD contribution to the thematic issue on RDF in chemistry
(coordinated by Matthias).

Please let me know if interested in joining the meeting,

Egon

Again I congratulate the commercial sector in making core code available for
the community to use and if necessary re-use and repurpose. It is difficult
to show the world the value of Open Source and Open Data and this is a very
valuable example.

Do you have a public justification for this business model? That would be
useful in helping us build a general case for this type of action.

I know that it hasn't always worked in science. It's very successful in IT
(ever since Cygnus) but it was disappointing that the Lion model of selling
public services into companies didn't work out. I have no inside knowledge
why, but there is no reason why the model should not work. Redistributing
information  is hard even with modern tools and issues like security are
even harder.

I believe that all the members of the Blue Obelisk (of course there are no
formal members) welcome the use of their software by commercial companies,
including being sold. It's always useful to know when this happens because
it strengthens our case and gives us additional personal resolve. It's
useful to know that at 0200 when your software is still crashing that there
are people out there who appreciate it and who apprecaite it enough to sell
it and services based on it. It's not freeloading - it's the basis of open
source - but it helps the culture if it's encouraged.

Good software takes a long time and I think a number of BlueO products are
now maturing. (We are putting together some of this at Daresbury next week
for automating compchem).

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=PVF5f0nzBtSG5jCNrqGsUosV2JwbQQHomQRBO@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

The Linked Open Drug Data follow up hack session on Wednesday resulted in
three new IsItOpenData? requests, which you can view below:

WHO Global Health Observatory:
http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/dd96476c-1a04-4f8a-b7de-903c93e6ce7d/
RxNorm at US National Library of Medicine (NLM):
http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/dfcd613b-f637-4715-a549-125680afa2aa/
DailyMed at NLM:
http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/37135c72-a330-416f-bf7a-0a2aaba53b18/

We look forward to the responses to these requests, and to clarifying their
openness.

One of the aims of the hack sessions is to involve people from specific
subject areas or interest groups who are not regular working group members,
therefore the original session  raised the need for a guide for people who
are not familiar with CKAN, IsItOpenData? or OKF definitions on openness.
I've put together the guide below with step by step instructions for running
and taking part in a similar hack session:
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hacksessioninfo

It is very detailed, as it's aimed at people who may never have visited the
relevant websites before. Please add anything I've missed and your own hints
and tips!

I am giving a talk on Panton at the ACS at 0910 LOCAL California time on
MONDAY (have the clocks changed this weekend?). I am hoping we can get
internet and can maybe have a live demonstration of the Etherpad - perhaps
we can help to create the Panton paper on Textmining that I am meant to have
written! It would be great to have 3-4 people editing away on the Etherpad
and taking this as an opportunity to create something as well.

I will also show IsItOpenData online ...

*27 - Open Data and the Panton Principles*

* Dr Peter Murray-Rust. * *Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge,
Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom*

Although an increasing amount of chemical data is becoming visible on the
Internet it cannot be re-used without explicit permission to avoid
potentially breaking copyright. The Open Knowledge Foundation and Science
Commons have collaborated on a definition of Open Data and produced a set of
principles and practices (Panton Principles) to help authors and publishers
assert that their published data is truly Open. An example of fully Open
Data is shown in Crystaleye http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye with over
200,000 crystallographic datasets from the literature. Several publishers
are adopting Panton, and this presentation will show the advantages of doing
so
