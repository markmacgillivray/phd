*Announcement*

The Open Knowledge Foundation & Citizen Cyberscience Center are going to
hold regular meetings about Citizen Science & microtasking every Thursday
at 5pm (BST) via a public Google+ Hangout.

In the upcoming meeting tomorrow we will be talking with Micha? Kubacki
(@mkubacki) about his Misomorf application (
http://www.etaoikeyboard.com/misomorf/), and its relation to the graph
isomorphism problem http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_isomorphism_problem

Discussion of all things Citizen Science, Crowdcrafting & Microtasking in
an open context is thoroughly welcome and participation is encouraged.

If you would like to join in with these discussions on the day, please

I am afraid I shall be on the road otherwise I would love to come. Just to
start, I thought the code for graph isomorphism was very nice and very
usable.

Hi Peter,

Don't worry, there will be other opportunities :-) We will be having these
meetings regularly.

I think there is a real opportunity for crowdsourcing the metadata for
scholarship (see #scholrev) and then for content mining. We have to make
the use of our tools lightweight even if the tools themselves are heavy. I
suspect there is a need for simple webservices here. But it can wait a week
or two

Message-ID: <CABPM+wqaWhZzJ3qrTHvjkA9cNYoJrx1Q8qJT8FLZftmOaMA8Jg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All

Open Science Austria's Coordinator Stefan and I are getting together on
Saturday (0900 UTC via Google Hangout) to work on science.okfn.org. The
website content is in need of an update and there are some features we
could add.

Specifically, we want to launch an open science calendar to which anyone
can contribute events and which will be a great resource for finding out
about open science conferences and meetings all over the world, this would
obviously be re-useable on anyone's websites and we would encourage you to
embed it if you run an open science group!

If you want to join us, or you can't make it but would like to contribute
suggestions or offer to work on a page/feature at another time, please
check out the pad!
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-webhack

Thanks and we look forward to hearing your ideas for improving the working
group's web presence and providing useful resources for anyone interested
in open science.

Jenny and Stefan

Dear All,

Here's a link to our upcoming Citizen Cyberscience Workshop at Uni Geneva on Monday-Tuesday 22-23 April.

http://informatique.cuso.ch/activities/detail-activity/item/courses/citizen-cyberscience/

Should be a great chance to learn about some of the citizen science software that OKF is involved with through Crowdcrafting.org (Pybossa, Epicollect, CernVM?) and hack on some neat new apps.

Several of the key developers will be there, and a range of scientists (CERN/particle physics; UN/disaster mapping UNI Geneva/ bioscience?).

Also an excellent opportunity to brainstorm with local experts about the OKF Festival in Geneva later in the year, and making the most of that for Open Science.

The event is free, but you must register as space is limited. For anyone currently studying in French-speaking Swiss universities, good news: travel and accommodation are covered, too. Contact the local organizer for details.

Please encourage members of OKF chapters in Switzerland and nearby (France, Germany, Austria) to come along.

Francois

PS Jenny: I've posted all this on pad for updating the open science web page, too :)

That's an extraordinarily skimpy article. The full survey report (uncited
by the article) is at
http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pdf/open-access-survey-march2013.pdf

It's worth reviewing because it includes almost 15,000 responses from the
83,000 authors who published in Taylor and Frances journals in 2011.  It's
certainly biased (as are all surveys) because it only includes those who've
already chosen that publisher, but still a good read.

There's much more detail in the the survey than just a laundry list of
licenses, including questions about authors views on various types of
reuse, importance of data vs text, etc.  It includes not only author
preferences but also author answers about their institutions policies and
those of their funders.

It's a 30 page report and includes an additional 16 pages containing the
complete text of the survey.

Tom

Thanks for the pointer, Tom. This survey is interesting from a number of perspectives.

First, the fact that this for-profit multinational conglomerate, informa.plc, working under its scholar-friendly-sounding 'brand" name Taylor & Francis, is conducting social science research which appears to be designed to inform public policy, and has control over distribution of surveys to 83,000 scholars. 

It is completely appropriate for publishers to conduct research to improve their services. However, social science research should be conducted by social scientists. It is telling that we scholars have given so much power to this commercial company that they can now conduct research on us scholars in a study of a scale that few social scientists would be able to complete with. This is more than a little biased, this is fox researches hen research and scholars need to understand that we are the hens in this scenario.

I have begun a series critiquing this survey. Another interesting aspect is that the question bias reflects more of a pro than anti-open-access bias, a refreshing change.

My posts to date:

Taylor & Francis Open Access Survey: Critique
Overall comments and links to other commentary
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/03/taylor-francis-open-access-survey.html

Attitudes and values regarding research communication
Note that I see here support for the access problem - 38% disagree or strongly disagree with the statement that "Researchers already have access to most of the articles they need".
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/03/attitudes-and-values-regarding-research.html

Attitudes and values regarding the dissemination of your research
Shows that respondents strongly favour more restrictive CC licenses, with CC-BY-NC-ND being the most popular.
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/04/attitudes-and-values-regarding.html

List members may also be interested in the March 31, 2013 Dramatic Growth of Open Access update:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/04/dramatic-growth-of-open-access-3013.html

Possibly of interest: since posting this about midnight yesterday I've received two substantive comments which have caused me to do some corrections and clarifications. Can this now be considered a peer-reviewed blogpost? Should I file it for the T&P committee?

Hi All

I've been involved in organising this conference, for which there are still
some last minute spaces left if anyone would like to attend or knows of
someone who might be interested. We are also hosting a free public debate
in the Oxford Union entitled 'Evolution or Revolution in Science
Communication?' to which all are welcome and I would encourage you to
spread the word!

We'll be tweeting at #openoxford and hope to have videos of sessions up on
youtube and iTunesU very shortly after the event so watch out for these if
you can't make it yourself.

Metrics are power and companies will continue to control them. That is why
we have to have bottom-up Open Knowledge

Hi All

Many of you will have seen this recent press release, but for those who
haven't:
http://www.nature.com/press_releases/scientificdata.html

This ties in with a recent blog post on doing science with open data, from
Tom Heath at the Open Data Institute, looking at the questions
* What are the implications of 'doing science' with open data?
* What changes are required in how we approach scientific methods and
findings based on open data?

NPG to launch Scientific Data to help scientists publish and reuse research
data

Nature Publishing Group (NPG) today is pleased to announce the Spring 2014
launch of Scientific Data. Open for submissions this autumn, Scientific Data is
a new open-access, online-only platform for the publication of descriptions
of scientifically valuable datasets. Scientific Data will initially focus
on experimental datasets from the life, biomedical and environmental
science communities with future plans to expand to other fields in the
natural sciences.

Scientific Data will introduce and publish a new type of content called
Data Descriptors: peer-reviewed, scientific publications that provide
detailed descriptions of experimental and observational datasets. Data
Descriptors will be a combination of traditional scientific publication
content and structured information curated in-house, and are designed to
maximize reuse and enable searching, linking and data mining. Data
Descriptors may be associated with articles from a broad range of journals.

"Over recent years researchers, funders and learned societies alike have
been calling for new ways to make scientific research, and research data,
more available, reusable and reproducible," says Jason Wilde, Nature
Publishing Group Business Development Director. "Scientific Data's central
mission is to help foster the sharing and re-use of the data underpinning
scientific research."

"Scientific Data will allow for the formal peer-review, publication and
citation of data sets and will provide a real opportunity to promote open
data and promote the re-use of data held by NERC and other research
organisations," says Mark Thorley, Head of Science Information at the
Natural Environment Research Council and Chair of the Research Councils UK
Research Outputs Network.

Scientific Data gives credit through a citable publication, for depositing
and sharing research data. Data Description will be accessible and
searchable via the Scientific Data online data platform, under a Creative
Commons license. The actual data files will be stored in one or more
public, community-recognized systems. The full release of Data Description
and associated data will be verified as part of the peer-review process.
Where a community recognized repository does not exist, Scientific
Data supports
the deposit of the data into a more general repository such as Dryad and
Figshare. All accepted data descriptors will be published on payment of an
article-processing charge (APC) that will also cover the Data Description
curation process.

Susanna-Assunta Sansone, Associate Director and Principal Investigator at
the University of Oxford e-Research Centre, has worked with the NPG team
for the past months to define the Data Description?s concept; she has now
been appointed Honorary Academic Editor of Scientific Data. She will work
closely with the Advisory Panel which is comprised of senior scientists,
data repository representatives, bio-curators, librarians, and funders who
guide the policies, standards, and editorial scope.

"The ongoing conversation around data curation, sharing and publication has
become increasingly exciting as various organisations have moved to
encourage and in some cases support the sharing and reuse of data in
context," says Honorary Academic Editor Sansone. "To inform the internal
development of Scientific Data, I will continue to stay abreast of the
fast-paced fields of data management and scholarly communication."

This is great news. Perhaps we should put something about this on the main
OKF blog - in particular noting how we hope this will be explicitly
encouraging researchers to publish data openly, as per the Panton
Principles?

It's not all great news...

They're doing their usual NPG quirk of charging more if the
author chooses to publish under CC BY rather than CC BY-NC (they're
offering a 'choice' of licences).
see http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/open-access/

?585 for more restrictive licencing & ?650 for CC BY.
This will of course help authors to choose the cheaper more restrictive
option :(

I've blogged about this before:
http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/11/07/gold-oa-pricewatch/

There's also no absolute guarantee the data will be open data as per
http://opendefinition.org/ either. The data will go to appropriate
community databases in some instances, and some of these may not be open.


So, yes it's good that Nature care about data, and may offer some of it as
open data - but unfortunately I think it's quite likely that it won't all
be open, and there are better more open, less expensive data journals out
there.

Best,

Ross

I am with Ross.

Why wouldn't I just put my data in figshare or Dryad and be done with it? Creating these "Data Descriptors" seems like inventing a new kind of publication that wasn't necessarily needed. And the differential pricing for different licenses is just goofy signifying god knows what -- are different licenses worth different amounts? This sends just the wrong kind of message.

Hi Ross and Puneet,

good to see discussion; I am happy also to collect feedback, given that 
my role is also to provide an outward facing side to accelerate the 
communication.

Hi Ross, just to point out this text too: "Metadata in the Data 
Descriptors will be made available under the CC0 protocol to promote 
maximum reuse." (http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/open-access/)
The Data Descriptors (see 
http://www.nature.com/scientificdata/for-authors/data-descriptor-content-and-submission/) 
will consist of both traditional narrative publication content and 
structured information, including key experimental metadata, that 
describes the dataset in a standardized, searchable format to aide reuse 
and discovery. Wearing my _Un of Oxford's hat_, it is my opinion that 
the structured/searchable information is CC0 and for the more 
traditional narrative content the author is given the choice (but note 
that the ND option is _not_ among these). Scientific Data will work only 
with open community databases; so far Data Dryad and FigShare are indeed 
open.

Hi Puneet, just to clarify that Data Descriptors are not mean to replace 
e.g. DataCite metadata for traditional articles; but are meant to 
describe the experimental steps. There are many many 
(researchers-driven) community standardization efforts that want these 
experimental steps richly described and standardized (fyi, see list for 
biosciences at: http://biosharing.org/standards) so that when a dataset 
is shared it can be understood, reused and in principle reproduced. 
Therefore helping publish these experimental descriptors (using 
community-0standrads as much as possible) is addressing a real need.

Btw, for those attending the http://rigourandopenness.org/ I will be 
there for more discussion.

Thanks,
Susanna

Yes, any discussion of this should definitely mention the solutions which
are already in place like Figshare (and even OKFN's own CKAN/TheDataHub).
 Highlighting the growing recognition of the importance of data publishing
would be a useful blog post, but it would be better to survey the landscape
than focus on Nature.

There's also something a little perverse about their idea that to be
"citable" you need to be blessed by a big publishing house. DOIs and even
plain old garden variety URIs are eminently citable.  Of course, what they
mean is "citable in a way that will grant you ivory tower kudos," which
ties back in to the whole altmetrics discussion.

Researchers could be deposited their data in their local repositories at no cost to them; most research institutions already have the repositories, so this is a bit of extra work / computer space but in most cases not much more. The peer review as usual will be done by researchers at no cost to the publisher. Publishers moving into this arena on a for-pay basis is not great news. 

This whole system - free gifting of academic work in the form of research results and reviewing - rests on the assumption of secure academic positions at universities. What impact will trends such as MOOCs and automatic grading have on this system? 

If we move forward towards transitioning scholarly communication to open access without addressing this question, are we in effect killing the goose that is laying those golden eggs?

Susanna,

Thank you for your comments.  It is indeed welcome that metadata are
provided under CC0, just as Nature has done with metadata for it's other
publications [1].  Such efforts deserve applause as an example to other
publishers; and it is telling that it seems we must look
to business-driven publishers (Nature, PeerJ) rather than our own
scientific societies (AAAS?) for such innovation.  The perverse incentives
in licensing costs that Ross draws attention to are perhaps the sad price
we pay for that.

I was wondering if you or others might comment in any greater length upon
Tom's question about "citable".  We hear frequently how a DOI makes
something "citable".  Journals have their own requirements about what can
and cannot be "cited" -- perhaps they are driven by what sources are or
aren't indexed by Thompson Reuters or others?  For instance, it is curious
that Nature will frequently provide links in articles, but these are not
indexed as citations.  Who controls what is "citable" - the DOI providers?
the citation counters? the journal? the researchers themselves?

Cheers,
Carl

Data, charts, and word versions of my latest Dramatic Growth of Open Access issue are posted in the SFU SUMMIT here:
http://summit.sfu.ca/item/12645

Cite away!

This took me seconds, costs nothing at all to me, saves me time as compared with working with a charging publisher (just upload, no fiddling with payment), and saves the university $ that could go towards actually paying scholars to do the work.

At 600GBP ($935 Cdn), a hundred datasets like this would cost $93,500 - or a decent salary for a junior to mid career academic. It's about time we started to connect the dots in this way - more money flowing from universities to commercial entities means less money for the actual work of the university, less for faculty salaries and to support students.

Well, I'm not an "academic," but I'm going to weigh in anyway.

I suspect that they actually view it as market/customer research, not
"social science" research and they certainly don't control distribution of
anything other than their own materials.  I'm sure those 83,000 people are
free to receive email and postal mail from whoever they like.

Very strange to see an argument for less data on an open science list.  If
you think a different kind of study should be done than DO IT, don't try to
discourage others from doing their research (and graciously making the data
available).

Of course, there are many more insights to be gained from the raw data
since they asked for organization names and email addresses and can look at
how the responders compare to non-responders as well as differences across
journals and disciplines, but I think it's great that they published as
much as they did.

Perhaps these examples will help non-academics to understand:

If we want good research done on the public's perception of the performance of banks with respect to the 2008 fiscal crisis, who should conduct the research? Academics or government staffers with a primary loyalty to uncovering truth and serving the public, or the banks most responsible for causing the crisis in the first place?

How about a survey on public perceptions of oil industry performance and the environment? Should British Petroleum, Exxon or Enbridge conduct the survey? 

best,

Forwarding from the Genetic Alliance by means of comparison with the example of giving elementary kids' data away without even asking. This is a model that puts the control where it belongs, in the hands of the consumer. There is an appropriate role for the private sector here, providing services that people can opt to participate in.

Genetic Alliance Announces
Registries for All

WASHINGTON, DC ? April 5, 2013 ? Registries for All (Reg4ALL) was introduced today at the 3rd annual CanLiv Research Symposium. Genetic Alliance is proud to present this exciting new resource, which enables individuals to participate in clinical trials and registries on their own terms. By giving people the tools to safely participate, we can expedite research and create more treatments for the benefit of all.

Researchers working to discover treatments face a problem: despite living in a world in which corporations use massive amounts of information on public spending habits to predict buying trends, behavior, and recently, even pregnancy, there is little available data on the diseases with which people live. The dichotomy may be driven by a desire for privacy about health information, but a new tool called Registries for All is building a consumer-driven, cross-disease health registry platform in which individuals have complete control over who sees what. Using a gamified interface, individuals can see how they compare to others.

By allowing individuals to share the information they specify, with the researchers and research organizations they chose, from specific academic medical centers to advocacy groups, Registries for All unlocks a trove of data of immense public health value. It will build communities of patients ready for the right trial to come to them.

?Right now millions of people desperately need treatments for diseases from liver disease to diabetes, from heart disease to arthritis. The path to those treatments is clinical trials. Clinical trials are woefully under-enrolled ? hundreds are shut down every year because only one or two people are signed up for them?, said Donna Cryer, patient advocate and Genetic Alliance advisor.

?Enter Reg4ALL, a system in which the right trial comes to the participant?, Robert Shelton, CEO and founder of Private Access, explained. ?Private Access? technology enables individuals to set their own sharing and data access preferences. This then provides the mechanism for the researcher to find the right group of individuals quickly and cost effectively.?

?By merging respect for their privacy wishes with access to relevant and actionable medical information, Reg4ALL is giving participants more control over their destinies,? explained Sharon Terry, CEO of Genetic Alliance, the 26-year old non-profit organization that owns Reg4ALL. ?This collaboration has the potential to accelerate medical progress by putting patients' needs front and center."

Reg4ALL ultimately creates a living, dynamic registry, allowing individuals to log their experiences over time. This will accelerate translational science by creating well-characterized ready cohorts of individuals and communities that can participate in, and even initiate, clinical trials.

For more information, please visit www.reg4all.org.

A curious case of open access "research" from "Oxford Biotech Roundtable":

Thanks to Peter Suber for the tip about yet another misleading open access survey. Following are my comments. In brief, this appears to be a curious case of two layers of smoke and mirrors about who is behind the survey that could make for an interesting question for a research methods class. The survey preamble says that this is a student-led organization. The about page claims that this is the health care and life sciences industry. The description of gold and green OA reflect the biases of the toll access scholarly publishing industry, which are at odds with those of the health care and life sciences industry. Who are you really, OBR?

this other than commercial interests of Nature. If tthe scientific
community (Wellcome, NIH, NSF, RCUK, etc.) is arguing for CC-BY then it's
irresponsible (at best) for NPG to do otherwise.

Comment:
 
The Wellcome Trust, NIH, NSF, RCUK, etc., is the funding agency community, not the scientific community. There are some scientists arguing for CC-BY, but what little evidence we have on this suggests that the majority prefer more restrictive licenses - details and links here:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/04/attitudes-and-values-regarding.html

This is not to say that I support NPG on this. The license should be the author's, not the publishers, in my opinion. In other words, NC should mean "no blanket commercial rights granted to any third party", not "commercial rights reserved by NPG". Requests for commercial uses should go to the author, not the publisher, with "commercial" understood to be limited to resale of the content of the work per se. For example, if someone pays to print an article they might well pay for the printing service. This is not commercial use if no royalty is collected for the work.

Because the Nature 6-month embargo is sufficient to meet the terms of OA policies, my suggestion to NPG would be to offer authors the choice of any CC license, not make any distinction in price, and encourage authors to rely on the green method to participate.

Dear Heather ? I just read your paranoid notes below (and blog) about the
Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable (OBR), a student led organization - instigated
by our act of conducting a survey into Open Access Publishing (how dare
we?) and not living up to Paul Zuma?s standards of scholarship?

Heather: you asked: ?Who are you really, OBR??  (In what appeared to be a
McCarthy-esqe tone.)

Look, if you were capable of even the bare minimum of research into OBR and
looked at our executive committee you would see we?re led entirely of PhD
students and post-docs:
http://www.oxbridgebiotech.com/about-obr/executive-committee/

As the founder and President of OBR (and PhD *student* at Oxford) I do not
take exception towards Zuma for finding our survey methodology imperfect
(when it comes to OA he?s beyond biased, but obviously raised good points).


I do, however, take exception that you then pursue some whisper campaign
maligning our character and even claiming we?re not really student led.

We were founded in Oxford in June 2011, then opened a chapter in Cambridge,
then London and since we?ve grown to nearly 8,000 members with additional
chapters in Manchester, Glasgow (Scotland), and San Diego, Los Angeles and
SF-Bay.  Our goal is to foster a conversation between academics (from
across disciplines) and industry experts.  Look Heather, we actually don?t
think ?industry? is an ugly word. We welcome commerce, the
commercialization of science, and the jobs and innovative products that
comes from it.  For you to suggest we?re just ?smoke and mirrors? is
border-line slanderous and I highly encourage you to avoid these Holier
Than Thou witch-hunt campaigns.

But as OBR's mission is to educate, here are two simple steps to avoid
repeat episodes like this:

1) Research your facts
2) Remove the tin-foil from around your head

ps. Ok I?ll admit it: we have some post-docs on our exec committee. We
really are out to get to you.

best, Dan

Hi All

Thanks to Stefan and Vincent for joining me in updating the website this
morning, you can check our progress here
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-webhack

In summary:

VIDEOS
We now have videos from researchers explaining open science on the home
page, which will soon be organised into a much more aesthetically pleasing
gallery format, at which point we'll be requesting further contributions.

Please let us know your top open science video content on the web so we can
present a working group curated list of lectures/debates that people should
watch (there's a lot of content out there now, which is great, but what
have been your favourite talks?)
There is a space for suggestions on http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-webhack

CALENDAR

Stefan has made a start on a community calendar to which anyone can add
open science events using a simple form, feature suggestions and offers of
technical assistance much appreciated.

OPEN SCIENCE TOOLS

Vincent will be working on adding content to the open science tools page
http://science.okfn.org/tools-for-open-science/

If you'd be willing to help out or even just give us URLs to tool lists you
already know about, let us know in the pad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-webhack

Other than some minor content tweaking, that's about where we reached.
We'll try and run another session in a few weeks but do keep adding your
suggestions for content features and tools to the pad, especially if you'd
be able to offer a little help in building or maintaining a page.

Thanks a lot!

Jenny

Personally, I think it would be extraordinarily unlikely for all parties in
a multi-party negotiation to have their interests perfectly aligned.
 Typically each party argues for their own interest.

Because I believe that in scientific publishing there is an implied
commitment from both sides to behave in a mututally constructive manner. If
you argue that the morals and practices of STM publishers should emulate
banks, energy companies, etc  in trying to make as much money as possible,
creating confusion, and offering flawed deals then I concede your argument.

I have published for years with publishers who behave in a reasonable
manner (BMC, PLoS) who offer CC-BY publication without prevarication and
confusion. They label their products coherently. Meanwhile the mainstream
publishers are sowing confusion and actively fighting and lobbying against
us. Many publishers have argued against content-mining, for example and
CC-NC is deliberately used to prevent it.

Remember that this is an asymmetric deal. Almost all the publishers' value
is GIVEN by academia. It is responsible to give reasonable value in return,
not try to grab more.

Yes,  you probably think I'm looking back to a golden age (which never
existed). But if STM publishing has descended to a dog-eat-dog fight we are
not serving the people of the world.

I shall be blogging on this.

hi Daniel,

Thank you for your response. To clarify, are you doing this research as a student? If so, can you point me to your academic supervisor for this study and your ethics clearance information?

In academic research it is important to state such matters as who sponsored a study, declare conflicts, etc. Look at the author guidelines of a reputable publisher such as Nature, PLoS, BMC for the kinds of information academic critics should have access.

Alternatively, perhaps you think your group is beyond such academic protocols as research ethics? If so, this has interesting implications, particularly in biotech which presumably includes medical research.

I would be interested in hearing your perspective on academic critique. What constitutes an appropriate response to critique of your approach?

Looking forward to your response,

Heather Morrison

Dear Heather ? I just read your paranoid notes below (and blog) about the
Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable (OBR), a student led organization - instigated
by our act of conducting a survey into Open Access Publishing (how dare
we?) and not living up to Paul Zuma?s standards of scholarship?

Heather: you asked: ?Who are you really, OBR?? (In what appeared to be a
McCarthy-esqe tone.)

Look, if you were capable of even the bare minimum of research into OBR and
looked at our executive committee you would see we?re led entirely of PhD
students and post-docs:
http://www.oxbridgebiotech.com/about-obr/executive-committee/

As the founder and President of OBR (and PhD *student* at Oxford) I do not
take exception towards Zuma for finding our survey methodology imperfect
(when it comes to OA he?s beyond biased, but obviously raised good points).


I do, however, take exception that you then pursue some whisper campaign
maligning our character and even claiming we?re not really student led.

We were founded in Oxford in June 2011, then opened a chapter in Cambridge,
then London and since we?ve grown to nearly 8,000 members with additional
chapters in Manchester, Glasgow (Scotland), and San Diego, Los Angeles and
SF-Bay. Our goal is to foster a conversation between academics (from
across disciplines) and industry experts. Look Heather, we actually don?t
think ?industry? is an ugly word. We welcome commerce, the
commercialization of science, and the jobs and innovative products that
comes from it. For you to suggest we?re just ?smoke and mirrors? is
border-line slanderous and I highly encourage you to avoid these Holier
Than Thou witch-hunt campaigns.

But as OBR's mission is to educate, here are two simple steps to avoid
repeat episodes like this:

1) Research your facts
2) Remove the tin-foil from around your head

ps. Ok I?ll admit it: we have some post-docs on our exec committee. We
really are out to get to you.

best, Dan

Wow, both condescension and bad analogies packed into such a brief passage.

The study didn't involve the "public" in any way, shape or form.  It was a
handful of the privileged elite who form a significant segment of Taylor &
Francis' customer base.  Not only do they contribute revenue directly
through author fees, but they influence the librarians who make
subscription purchasing decisions.  Taylor & Francis would be *very*
motivated to get an accurate view of the sentiments of this population
(whether or not, they'd share the complete view is another story entirely).

If you want a Jane Q. Public analogy, try digital music.  Who do you think
would be more motivated to get an accurate picture of the public's
attitudes toward purchasing digital music - an academic researcher or the
market researchers at Apple, Google, and the RIAA?

I'll repeat - the answer to studies that you don't agree with isn't
muzzling those studies, but to do your own studies and flood us with better
data.  Sitting on the sidelines carping about others isn't going to improve
things.

Heather - It says right on the survey page that it's paid for by sponsors,
so I don't think there's much mystery as to whether it's a commercial or
academic survey.  You can find their corporate registrations here:
http://opencorporates.com/companies?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=oxbridge++roundtable&commit=Go

Daniel - Congratulations on building your company to this scale at such a
young age.  Since the focus of this thread is open access, can you tell
who's paying for the survey?  That should help provide insight into it's
construction and administration.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about your funding in overall, so
if you'd like to share a more general revenue picture, that'd be awesome.

Tom

Heather:

I am disappointed that you appear to have an inability to read or
comprehend even rudimentary facts and arguments.  And that you continue
this process of innuendo.

1) In your first email and blog post you quite flippantly accused OBR of
being some kind of front-organization, suspiciously asking: "so who is
OBR?" and suggesting there were "smoke and mirrors".  You could have
deduced who we are by looking at our website.  I responded to your paranoid
and unfounded arguments.  Instead of apologizing for your rumors and
correcting your errors, you asked more "questions" and tried to spin this
as simply questioning our academic scholarship. (ahem?)

2) RE: "Research Ethics":  Again, alas, you haven't researched your facts.
Who said we were doing this as part of a student's normal research project?
You need to chillout and (as mentioned in step 1 below, remove the tin
foil)

Look:  There are two student teams working on this project, one at Oxford
and one at Cambridge. Each are composed of 4 life science PhD students that
are aiming to take their academic talents into industry (management
consultancy is a popular destination) and as such are honing their
professional and transferrable skills before graduating.  As Tom Morris
correctly pointed out, the survey clearly indicated it was industry
sponsored.

Honestly, Heather - please, for the sake of the group: think before you
spout, email, or blog any accusations, and try to look up your facts.

For a crash course on innuendo please watch this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSA4ItcezAA

Tom: I don't really have any interest at all in open access. I only joined
this list today to defend OBR from baseless attacks.  I'll be unsubscribing
now to focus exclusively on plotting lucrative new paywalls around taxpayer
funded research articles ;)

But, since you asked: yes, we were contracted by a publishing company to
look into Open Access and how that will affect the industry. We weren't
looking to construct a flawed or biased survey - that disappoints me  Our
client (who are themselves a non-profit) wanted to understand these rapidly
fluid industry trends better. and the students involved were all themselves
interested in building real-world skills while becoming more informed
around OA. (They've done a great job and have learned a bunch!)

In terms of OBR overall: this survey was small component of a small
project. The project represents  maybe 1% of OBR's revenue this year.
(though probably even less than that.)

Our overriding goals are educational - and to spark an on-campus
conversation between academics and industry.

best, Dan

ps. I think I've made my point(s), so I'm unsubscribing
pps. Heather, OBR is not yet in Canada, but fear not, we're coming to a
Paywall near you.

Who was the non-profit publishing company that hired Oxbridge?

Tom,

Thanks, this is a good point. However, this indicates a contradiction  
in the information provided on the survey form.

The preamble says: "Thank you very much for taking part in this study  
on European trends in Open Access Publishing by the Oxbridge Biotech  
Roundtable, a UK-based student-led organisation. It should take ~7  
minutes to complete. Your answers will help us to gain valuable  
insight into the Open Access use among academics in your field".

This presents the survey as one conducted by a student-led organization.

The fine print at the bottom of the page says: "Our sponsors pay a fee  
to OBR for gathering, aggregating and collecting the data as well as  
for preparation of a Summary Report of the data compiled. In  
participating in this survey, the participant recognizes that the  
information provided in this survey will be used in an industry  
aggregate report and therefore grants OBR unrestricted use of this  
information".

Both Daniel Perez and Mehmet Fidanboylu in comments here and on my  
blog are emphasizing their status as students and listing their  
academic affiliations. This is deceptive.

Mehmet says: in a comment on my blog:

May be worth taking a look at these faceless execs shamelessly posing  
as students?

Daniel Perez, CEO - "dual-doctorate at Lincoln College, Oxford and The  
Scripps Research Institute in California (DPhil, PhD)"...

Mehmet Fidanboylu, CMO - "completing a PhD in neuropharmacology at  
King's College London"

It is not appropriate to conduct a survey posing as students at these  
institutions when you are actually undertaking commercially sponsored  
research.

While we are on the broad topic of transparency, could you explain who  
you are and what your interest is, Tom? It's hard to tell from a gmail  
account.

I am a professional librarian and scholar, having recently completed a  
doctoral dissertation on the topic of scholarly communication and open  
access. My interest in this is finding out who is really behind this  
survey and what their motivations are.

I've updated my blogpost on this topic and am encouraging Daniel and  
Mehmet to actively engage in this discussion as I think it gets at the  
heart of the very important topic of the societal need for academic  
freedom and independence.

The post can be found here:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/04/industry-pretends-to-be-student-led-or.html

I'll update with this information.

best,

Umm, I don't think I argued anything remotely close to that.  It was a
simply a question.

I don't see how working towards a mutually agreeable outcome necessarily
entails walking in lockstep and being in 100% agreement on all things.
 Everyone has different values and viewpoints, even within the scientific
community.  Look at how different the values are from funders and
researchers, or even among the researchers themselves.

Daniel,

Facts - on the survey it says:

Preamble:

"Thank you very much for taking part in this study on European trends  
in Open Access Publishing by the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, a UK- 
based student-led organisation. It should take ~7 minutes to complete.  
Your answers will help us to gain valuable insight into the Open  
Access use among academics in your field."

Fine print at the bottom:

"Our sponsors pay a fee to OBR for gathering, aggregating and  
collecting the data as well as for preparation of a Summary Report of  
the data compiled. In participating in this survey, the participant  
recognizes that the information provided in this survey will be used  
in an industry aggregate report and therefore grants OBR unrestricted  
use of this information".

The preamble says that this research is being conducted by a student- 
led organization for its own purposes "help us to gain valuable  
insight..." while the fine print makes it clear that you are  
conducting this research on behalf of industry.

This is not paranoia; this is an industry survey disguised as a  
student-led survey. This proves my original point, that this is a  
deceptive survey - industry (fox) pretending to be the group studied  
(hen).

I encourage you to change the preamble to reflect the nature of the  
study. This is a small matter for an opinion study like this. However,  
since your group is in biotech (and you are the CEO), I am hoping that  
it is obvious to you how problematic it would be to take this approach  
with medical research (take money from industry to do research which  
is then conducted as a student-led organization but without bothering  
with things like research ethics).

Thank you for the information about the students involved in the study  
- I fully support well-paid student and graduate employment! I'd still  
very much like to know who commissioned the research.

best,

Heather Morrison

I think that this discussion should terminate here. It is not in the
intended spirit of this list which IMO is to develop a constructive
approach to Open Science. I am disappointed that there has been a public
accusation of lying - I have met some of the OBR people and they are not
dissembling - they are undergraduates/postgraduates who are setting up
science-based businesses. I am sorry to see them leaving the list.

This list is deliberately unmoderated and relies on constructive discussion.

Hi Jenny!

I really appreciate your activities. Some kind of "repository" for open science tools and videos would be a great idea for providing a starting point for those who want to know about open science and maybe even get involved. At the moment it's quite some work to get a picture of what open science is all about and where to begin when you want to start opening up your own research.

I just put some short thoughts into the pad concerning the open science tools section. Hope this might be of any interest/use.

Cheers,
Matthias

Student-led is not a guarantee of impartiality, openness and good practice.
 
Students like dressing up and pretending to be other people and adopting
other roles.
 
And it's all good, clean fun.
 
Unless it isn't.

Steve.

Daniel,

Facts - on the survey it says:

Preamble: 


"Thank you very much for taking part in this study on European trends in
Open Access Publishing by the Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable, a UK-based
student-led organisation. It should take ~7 minutes to complete. Your
answers will help us to gain valuable insight into the Open Access use among
academics in your field."


Fine print at the bottom: 


"Our sponsors pay a fee to OBR for gathering, aggregating and collecting the
data as well as for preparation of a Summary Report of the data compiled. In
participating in this survey, the participant recognizes that the
information provided in this survey will be used in an industry aggregate
report and therefore grants OBR unrestricted use of this information".


The preamble says that this research is being conducted by a student-led
organization for its own purposes "help us to gain valuable insight..."
while the fine print makes it clear that you are conducting this research on
behalf of industry.

This is not paranoia; this is an industry survey disguised as a student-led
survey. This proves my original point, that this is a deceptive survey -
industry (fox) pretending to be the group studied (hen).

I encourage you to change the preamble to reflect the nature of the study.
This is a small matter for an opinion study like this. However, since your
group is in biotech (and you are the CEO), I am hoping that it is obvious to
you how problematic it would be to take this approach with medical research
(take money from industry to do research which is then conducted as a
student-led organization but without bothering with things like research
ethics).

Thank you for the information about the students involved in the study - I
fully support well-paid student and graduate employment! I'd still very much
like to know who commissioned the research.

best,

Heather Morrison

and suggesting there were "smoke and mirrors".  You could have deduced who

2) RE: "Research Ethics":  Again, alas, you haven't researched your facts.
Who said we were doing this as part of a student's normal research project?
You need to chillout and (as mentioned in step 1 below, remove the tin foil)

Look:  There are two student teams working on this project, one at Oxford
and one at Cambridge. Each are composed of 4 life science PhD students that
are aiming to take their academic talents into industry (management
consultancy is a popular destination) and as such are honing their
professional and transferrable skills before graduating.  As Tom Morris
correctly pointed out, the survey clearly indicated it was industry
sponsored.

Honestly, Heather - please, for the sake of the group: think before you
spout, email, or blog any accusations, and try to look up your facts.

For a crash course on innuendo please watch this:

Tom: I don't really have any interest at all in open access. I only joined
this list today to defend OBR from baseless attacks.  I'll be unsubscribing
now to focus exclusively on plotting lucrative new paywalls around taxpayer
funded research articles ;)

But, since you asked: yes, we were contracted by a publishing company to
look into Open Access and how that will affect the industry. We weren't
looking to construct a flawed or biased survey - that disappoints me  Our
client (who are themselves a non-profit) wanted to understand these rapidly
fluid industry trends better. and the students involved were all themselves
interested in building real-world skills while becoming more informed around
OA. (They've done a great job and have learned a bunch!)

In terms of OBR overall: this survey was small component of a small project.
The project represents  maybe 1% of OBR's revenue this year. (though
probably even less than that.)

Our overriding goals are educational - and to spark an on-campus
conversation between academics and industry.

best, Dan

ps. I think I've made my point(s), so I'm unsubscribing
pps. Heather, OBR is not yet in Canada, but fear not, we're coming to a

Daniel - Congratulations on building your company to this scale at such a
young age.  Since the focus of this thread is open access, can you tell
who's paying for the survey?  That should help provide insight into it's
construction and administration.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about your funding in overall, so if
you'd like to share a more general revenue picture, that'd be awesome.

Tom

Dear Heather - I just read your paranoid notes below (and blog) about the
Oxbridge Biotech Roundtable (OBR), a student led organization - instigated
by our act of conducting a survey into Open Access Publishing (how dare we?)
and not living up to Paul Zuma's standards of scholarship?

Heather: you asked: "Who are you really, OBR?"  (In what appeared to be a
McCarthy-esqe tone.)

Look, if you were capable of even the bare minimum of research into OBR and
looked at our executive committee you would see we're led entirely of PhD
students and post-docs: http://www.oxbridgebiotech.
<http://www.oxbridgebiotech.com/about-obr/executive-committee/>
com/about-obr/executive-committee/

As the founder and President of OBR (and PhD student at Oxford) I do not
take exception towards Zuma for finding our survey methodology imperfect
(when it comes to OA he's beyond biased, but obviously raised good points).

I do, however, take exception that you then pursue some whisper campaign
maligning our character and even claiming we're not really student led.

We were founded in Oxford in June 2011, then opened a chapter in Cambridge,
then London and since we've grown to nearly 8,000 members with additional
chapters in Manchester, Glasgow (Scotland), and San Diego, Los Angeles and
SF-Bay.  Our goal is to foster a conversation between academics (from across
disciplines) and industry experts.  Look Heather, we actually don't think
"industry" is an ugly word. We welcome commerce, the commercialization of
science, and the jobs and innovative products that comes from it.  For you
to suggest we're just "smoke and mirrors" is border-line slanderous and I
highly encourage you to avoid these Holier Than Thou witch-hunt campaigns.

But as OBR's mission is to educate, here are two simple steps to avoid
repeat episodes like this:

1) Research your facts
2) Remove the tin-foil from around your head

ps. Ok I'll admit it: we have some post-docs on our exec committee. We
really are out to get to you.

best, Dan

Subject: [open-science] more fox researches hen research - this time in
hen's clothing
To: open-science <open-science at lists.okfn.org>


A curious case of open access "research" from "Oxford Biotech Roundtable":

Thanks to Peter Suber for the tip about yet another misleading open access
survey. Following are my comments. In brief, this appears to be a curious
case of two layers of smoke and mirrors about who is behind the survey that
could make for an interesting question for a research methods class. The
survey preamble says that this is a student-led organization. The about page
claims that this is the health care and life sciences industry. The
description of gold and green OA reflect the biases of the toll access
scholarly publishing industry, which are at odds with those of the health
care and life sciences industry. Who are you really, OBR?

I'd definitely like to see the discussions on this list become more
constructive.  There seems to be a presumption of evil/guilt for entire
classes of organizations and people with a complementary presumption of
sainthood for anyone wears an academic mantle.

Given that the topic of the list is nominally science, it'd be great to see
discussion driven by actual facts.

For those parties who's attitudes and practices we're actively trying to
change, there are many different tactics that can be used.  Continual
browbeating is not necessarily the most effective (or effective at all, in
many cases).  Persuasion comes in many more subtle forms which can be
incredibly effective when used well.

It is a fact that OBR is conducting a survey with a preamble that says  
the study is being conducted by a student-led organization and fine  
print that says that the study has been commissioned by industry.

As Florence points out, this is not open science. This is "science"  
conducted by industry under the guise of students. This is an  
important topic. The results of this survey could very well be  
presented in the context of a public policy discussion, and they could  
be presented as the student perspective. To do this, all the industry  
sponsor needs to do is copy and paste from the preamble of the survey.

If Tom & Peter have concerns about the tone of the discussion, it  
would be appropriate to point out that responding to criticism by  
alleging that your critic is crazy is not appropriate. I am critiquing  
the survey and the approach in a manner that is very appropriate from  
an academic standpoint, not attacking anyone personally. While I have  
serious concerns about this approach, I have no issues with Daniel or  
Mehmet personally and am inviting them to engage in the discussion.

Heather Morrison

Tom,

I am not suggesting muzzling any studies. You might note that I'm writing a series of blogposts on the Taylor & Francis survey, here:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.ca/2013/03/taylor-francis-open-access-survey.html

The basic principle of the need for independent inquiry remains. I have no doubt that the corporate sector is best qualified to conduct market research to determine how to best serve their customers and maximize their profits. We can completely trust Google with research on how to make the most profits for Google - they're obviously very good at this. However, research about public policies that could impact Google is best handled by a researcher who does not report to Google.

A few posts back, I asked if you could tell us a bit about who you are and what your interest in this discussion is. Do you work for a publishing company, hold stock in a publishing company, etc.?  If you're not at liberty to provide exact details, some general information would be helpful. To properly interpret what someone says, it is important to know who they are.

I participated in some heated discussions on that topic, when it was only still a speculation.

However,  for me [an otherwise happy user of Mendeley] it is an important question, what are the real arguments against using Mendeley now?
Sure, I can imagine that later it will evolve in a tool I don't want to use anymore (but there is bib file I can import, and files are stored also on my drive).
Sure, there are general arguments for using open software vs proprietary software.

Regards,
Piotr

As far as alternatives go, Wikindx is the open source reference management
software I was running on my own server before Mendeley:
http://wikindx.sourceforge.net/

It looks like it's still being actively maintained, and I'm sure any
additional development help from the open science community would be very
welcome.

Brian

In the interests of openness and transparency, can you say who you are, Open Science Space? Assuming there are humans behind this project? :)

Your e-mail is organizational, not identifying a person. Your About Us / Meet our Team page does not mention any humans. 

Contact Us is a web form with no human contact information.

which reports in great detail


<quote>Erik Cox, founder of a project called The Open Science
Space<http://www.opensciencespace.com/>which hopes to make science
more transparent, is currently raising funds to
launch a crowdfunding site dedicated to science-based projects. We asked
him to explain what open funding is all about, and how it can benefit
science.



?TRADITIONALLY finance for research is accessible to scientists through
quite limited channels such as research councils. The grant application
process can be long and laborious, and can often end in rejection or
require lengthy modification. It is also a process which goes unseen by the
public who only get to know about individual research when a mainstream
media outlet picks up on a story. ...

Noted. But you have to read the Nature article to get the name of a person - there is nothing on the organization's website.

Do you want to contribute money to an organization with no contact listed on its website, or have your project listed on a website? 

I don't mean to suggest that this is a fly-by-night operation, rather the website might give this impression. Open Science Space (Eric Cox??) did ask for suggestions.

best,

Heather

Hey there,

I'm one of the founders of microryza.com. I second what Heather said, can
the Open Science Space team identify yourself or send me an e-mail at
cindy at microryza.com? I'd absolutely love to chat more! We love connecting
with anyone that's interested in crowdfunding for research.

At Microryza, we just raised a substantial amount of funding and we care
very much about openness and transparency--look for changes there in the
coming months. We're a team of open science geeks from the University of
Washington.

Cindy

P.S. We're always looking for smart people to join our team (paid)! Just
shoot me an e-mail. We're from Seattle, but now located in Silicon Valley.

It'll be interesting to see how many of these crowdfunding sites the market
can support and whether we really need a different one for each little
niche.  Both Microryza  <https://wefunder.com/microryza> ($162,000) and The
Open Science Space
<http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-open-science-space--2?website_name=opensciencespace>
($40)
are themselves crowdfunded, so why not just use a generic platform like
Kickstarter or IndieAGoGo for science/research too?  I smell consolidation
in the wind.

Darn!  I was hoping that was going to turn out to be a cool acronym instead
of just a string of words.

Hey Tom, i just want to clarify that microryza is not crowdfunded. Wefunder's just shows the amounts we've raised offline. We used traditional methods to fund microryza a combination of investment and grants.


Although, crowdfunding is an interesting option for Startups and I am a fan of Wefunder.

Cindy - thanks for the clarification.  I definitely misinterpreted that.
 So you'll be using WeFunder for the next round or they just profiled you
because you were also in the crowd funding space?  They certainly put a ton
of work into producing a very nicely polished profile for you!

Michael's reply is excellent. 

I am wondering whether there is more to this than meets the eye at first. Why single out PLoS as an example? If anything, PLoS was an early leader in competing with the high-end journals like Nature and Science - and now it is the top publishers like Nature that are emulating PLoS ONE.

One possibility is that open access discussions are underway in the UK and the US. In the past, whenever such discussions have taken place it has not been unusual to see highly misleading information appear.

In 2006, representatives from Elsevier, Wiley, and the American Chemical Society met with "the pit bull of public relations", Eric Dezenhall. The NYT article seems to reflect the kind of strategy employed by Dezenhall.

As reported by Jim Giles in Nature:
http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v445/n7126/full/445347a.html

Some of Dezenhall's advice:
"The consultant advised them to focus on simple messages, such as "Public access equals government censorship". He hinted that the publishers should attempt to equate traditional publishing models with peer review, and "paint a picture of what the world would look like without peer-reviewed articles".

The latter suggests the kind of strategy behind the NYT article - paint the open access world as equated with low quality. I wonder if anyone at the NYT would be interested in doing some digging to find out where the ideas for this article came from? This might make for an interesting investigation!

best,

Heather Morrison

Tom,

Wefunder profiled us and we've been getting quite a few interested
investors that want to invest in Microryza through Wefunder, so Wefunder
definitely works! Whether or not we accept those investments is a different
story. We don't know what we will do for our next round--and we won't need
to raise another round for a long time.

Yes, they put in a ton of work in producing a very nicely polished
profile--their team is awesome. If anyone is interested in crowdfunding for
their start-up I'm happy to put you in touch with the Wefunder guys!

Cindy

Subject: [open-science] Science Crowd Funding
In-Reply-To: <CAAn5x+6ML=1rBYsrXEf+yMPFTy4D1tafiSLp=H9QT7pi4opV4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hey Cindy,

I love idea of crowdfunding in science (IMHO lack of bottom-up is the most important problem in the current academia).

However, I have two reservations:
(I do it here in public, as they seem to be related to all crowdfunding projects in science.)


1. 
As I see, most (or all) projects have lay-audience appeal, and perhaps otherwise it would be hard to collect money from, nomen omen, a crowd.
However, the majority of research projects are not as sexy*), as they require specific knowledge (or at least - time beyond looking for catchy pictures and a few sentences of headlines) to appreciate their goal, or their methodology.

Do you know if there is a way around it?
(Well, I may be biased, but I am doing theoretical physics, and I don't think it stands a chance with, say, biology projects.) 

*) Nowadays on conferences (and even more - grant proposals) people do over-advertise implications. But it does not make things better (tragedy of commons, etc) plus often verge on scientific dishonesty (and it is why I wouldn't try to make my projects sexier than they are).


2. 
From amounts raised (or asked for) it seems that the projects are on top of one's academic salary (and, by implication, "normal" projects).
Sure, it patches a hole, where e.g. there is a promising project, but one is not able to obtain funds for it from her/his own university/organization.
Do you plan a step further, when one can actually dedicate months solely to a dream research project?
(Or is it against TOS, or just it is harder to rise that amount of money?)


Regards,
Piotr

Hi all!

It is a pleasure to announce the formation of a working group on open
science in Brazil, led by Dr. Alexandre Hannud Abdo, advisory board of
OKFN Brasil. We have at the moment more than 20 professors commited
with open knowledge from more than 10 universities around the country
that are part of this group we are creating.

Please, see more details bellow (in Portuguese)

http://br.okfn.org/2013/04/12/ciencia-aberta/

If you know Brazilians involved with open science and open access, let
Abdo (Cced) and me know, please.

Subject: [open-science] Open Research Data Handbook - Call for Case Studies!
Message-ID: <CAB53Ly6eQq+UBtgJ8L7VVnnj7frdE8mkMpWyKMpbEvyhD7UnNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

The Open Research Data Handbook - a collaborative and volunteer-led guide
to Open Research Data practices - is beginning to take shape. We?ll be
asking for comment on the first few chapters soon.

We now need your help to gather *concrete case studies* which detail your
experiences of working with Open Research Data. Specifically, we are
looking for:
* Stories of the benefits you have seen as a result of Open Research Data
practices
* Challenges you have faced in open research, and how you overcame them
* Case studies of tools you have used to share research data or to make it
openly available
* Examples of how failing to follow open research practices has hindered
the progress of research (including but not limited to science)
* ... More ideas from you!

Case studies should be around 200-500 words long. They should be concrete,
based on real experiences, and should focus on one specific angle of open
research data (you can submit more than one study!).

To find out more and register your interest, please visit this blog post
and form<http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/09/open-research-data-handbook-call-for-case-studies/>
.

As we are keen to gather studies from diverse groups, please do circulate
this email to friends, colleagues and any relevant mailing lists.

We also welcome volunteers to help with drafting and editing the book. To
contact the team directly, please email researchhandbook at okfn.org.

We look forward to reading your open research data stories!

All the best,
Michelle (from the Open Research Data Handbook team)

Hi All

Announcing the Oxford Open Science programme for 2013, all welcome, talks
will be podcast under CC-BY after the event so if you can't make it just
check the website for links. We may try Google Hangouts depending on
demand, let me know if you'd be keen to join remotely.

Oxford Open Science
Oxford e-Research Centre, 7 Keble Road, 19:00-20:30

Join us for informal discussion on open science in a digital age. Maybe
you're looking at ways to share scientific data more effectively, planning
a project involving citizen crowd sourcing, want to make your research as
accessible as possible or maybe you're just interested in how openness and
transparency could change the way we do science, come along and explore.

Our first session of the year will introduce the way in which the web
changes how we measure the impact of our research.

Subject: [open-science] PyBossa meets CKAN projects
Message-ID: <CAGS_vfow7+TE=AUmwMoXPNkZUS1rfmD=DwE=CCeQcWT6HpZN4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Today we have released a new feature for PyBossa that some of you may find
it interesting: *PyBossa can now export your app data to a CKAN server!!!*.

As some of you may know, OKF develops the awesome tool CKAN for data
management that makes data *accessible* ? by providing tools to streamline *
publishing*, sharing, *finding* and *using* data. CKAN is aimed at data
publishers (national and regional governments, companies and organizations)
wanting to make their data open and available.

Therefore it seemed like a perfect match since the beginning :-) Moreover,
we wanted to give the app owners the power of getting their data cited, so
when you export the data, you can then choose which licenses do you want to
use for the data, how people should use the data, etc. etc.

If you are running your own PyBossa server you can configure which CKAN
server you want to support: you can, if you want, set up your own CKAN
server for hosting the data that your PyBossa applications are generating
thanks to the crowd!

The documentation has not been yet updated, we were so excited about the
new feature that we wanted to release it asap, but it will be along the
week.

All the best,

Daniel

Dear all,

It is a great pleasure for me to announce that the Open & Citizen Science
workgroup at OKF France launched this morning :) The announcement -- in
French, naturally -- is here:
http://fr.okfn.org/2013/04/16/lancement-du-groupe-de-travail-science-ouverte-et-citoyenne/

A few projects have volunteered to join forces (e.g., some here will
remember WAXScience, the gender and science student project from Paris).

An excellent start of the group is also the fact that it (and OKF France as
a whole) is a partner of the NASA Space Apps Challenges -- Paris event
(where I am leading the 'Citizen Science' challenges :) ).

Talk soon,
Rayna

Excellent!
We very much look forward to hearing about WAX - presented at the OKF
crowdsourcing hackathon a month ago. It's a simple clever idea (scanning
FLICKR to count the gender ratio in photos of science activities)

For more about WAX-science see their blog here:
http://waxscience.blogspot.co.uk/

and their Twitter here: https://twitter.com/waxscience

It's still very early days for this project. So we shouldn't expect too
much, too soon. But it's certainly very exciting & very welcome!

Definitely one to watch in 2013

Subject: [open-economics] RECODE open research data project
To: "open-economics at lists.okfn.org" <open-economics at lists.okfn.org>


Dear Colleagues,

This project, funded by the EU, may be interesting...
http://recodeproject.eu/

With best wishes,

Thomas

"The Policy RECommendations for Open Access to Research Data in Europe
(RECODE) project will leverage existing networks, communities and projects
to address challenges within the open access and data dissemination and
preservation sector and produce policy recommendations for open access to
research data based on existing good practice.

The open access to research data sector includes several different
networks, initiatives, projects and communities that are fragmented by
discipline, geography, stakeholder category (publishers, academics,
repositories, etc.) as well as other boundaries. Many of these
organisations are already addressing key barriers to open access to
research data, such as stakeholder fragmentation, technical and
infrastructural issues, ethical and legal issues, and state and
institutional policy fragmentation. However, these organisations are often
working in isolation or with limited contact with one another. RECODE will
provide a space for European stakeholders interested in open access to
research data to work together to provide common solutions for these
issues. It will provide over-arching recommendations for a policy framework
to support open access to European research data.

The RECODE partners will identify relevant stakeholders, build upon and
strengthen existing stakeholder engagement mechanisms. It will conduct
studies of good practice and exchange good practice principles with
relevant stakeholders and institutions during networking activities. The
RECODE project will culminate in a series of policy recommendations for
open access to research data targeted at different stakeholders and
policy-makers."

Hello,

Wouldn't it be good to have the OKFN as partner on this?

I've been in touch with the coordinators of the project about this and how
we and others might be able to find out about what they are doing, and get
involved in relevant policy work. But I haven't heard anything back from
them so far...

Over the last couple of days, Chris Gutteridge and I have been writing
about how to counter concerns about opening up data:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDtHpnIDTY_G32EMJniXaOGBufjHCCk4VC9WGOf7jK4

More relevant to this list, Carly Strasser of the Data Pub blog followed
up with her own post, looking at these issues from more of an Open
Science and research data perspective:

http://datapub.cdlib.org/closed-data-excuses-excuses/

A very useful read it is, too!


Best regards,

Alex

Hi all,

I've been following the list for a few weeks now, but only just got 
around to introducing myself. Having been a postdoc for a few years in 
the UK and Germany (working on various kinds of biophysical 
instrumentation), I've recently joined MDPI, an open access publisher in 
Basel, as an editor.

I've been interested in open access and open science for some time, and 
reading the book 'Reinventing Discovery' by Michael Nielsen confirmed a 
lot of the things I'd already been thinking. It's great to find this 
list and see some like-minded people trying to make a difference!

Best wishes,

Martyn

MDPI is a BOAI-compliant publishers and one of the relatively few such
which publish chemistry. As a result I am using their content for
content-mining (#ami2).

 Up until 2008 they used the CC-NC licence. I wrote to them (and some other
publishers) pointing out the downside of CC-NC.

*Up to 2008 most articles published by MDPI contained the note "? year by
MDPI (http://www.mdpi.org). Reproduction is permitted for noncommercial
purposes". During 2008 MDPI journals started to publish articles under
the Creative
Commons Attribution License
<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>[image:
external link]. However, all articles published by MDPI before and during
2008 should be considered as released under the same Creative Commons
Attribution License since 2008.*

So it's worth writing to CC-NC publishers - many of whom are not aware of
the downsides. Of course some of the others use CC-NC as a way of
restricting redistribution to try to protect their markets. But we should
still write.

*********

There are still a few places left for this free one-day event:

Joint OpenAIRE/LIBER Workshop : ?Dealing with Data: What?s the Role for the Library?. 28 May, Gent, Belgium.  This is a pre-ELAG workshop.

This workshop will explore where the library and research institution sit in relation to supporting research data management, and what future expectations for libraries might be.

The library and research institution are having to understand their role within this changing environment, and define the necessary support mechanisms. OpenAIRE supports a range of stakeholders, namely librarians and researchers in depositing, searching as well as linking research output. LIBER supports libraries in making the transformation and acquiring an active role in evolving areas such as research data management and scientific information infrastructures.

Expert speakers will cover issues such as the data life-cycle, data citation, data publication, tools, and how research institutions can support their researchers in data management. In addition, a number of scientists will present their views on how  they  use, share, and link research data within different domains. The day will close with a panel session, supported by members of the LIBER Steering Committee ?Scholarly Communication and Research Infrastructure? which will explore future skill-sets for librarians.

Full programme: http://www.openaire.eu/en/component/content/article/9-news-events/456

Please, see

http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/04/29/redrawing-the-map-from-access-to-participation/

Worth thinking on the impact this can also have on Wikimedia projects when
it comes to the actual knowledge
divide<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_divide>,
mainly like Wikipedia, which aggregates knowledge in the form of a
encyclopedia through reliable sources.

This reminds me the reason why organizations like Article
19<http://www.article19.org/>were created (private communication with
a friend who worked there), where
a UNESCO report from the 80's already pointed out such divide (I have to
remember the name of the report).

To face this reality is a way for we try to learn what can be done in terms
of metrics on our global projects.

(Although I must tell my biggest concern now is that we from the global
south - or whatever you call it, maybe we could call the big fraction of
the world without access to knowledge - have access to scientific and
educational knowledge.)

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEw_qUwxrdnBiAivpOqchh1nPQCk7zhfmS4cpnitsURWvw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey open-science list,


We're in the process of compiling a list of notable, 'senior' open
scientists to publish on a dedicated page on http://science.okfn.org/
We think this is an important move to publicly demonstrate that open
approaches & advocacy, in STEM research are used by the very best.

Who would you nominate as an excellent example of an established open
scientist?

*Criteria & Guidance:* We're looking for Principal Investigators and above
here.
Whilst there are many excellent open grad students and postdocs out there,
we're just looking for a list of very *established* open scientists on this
occasion.

Our list in progress is linked below (it's only just begun, we're probably
missing many obvious names):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdDlNd0p3RXRzQVhTcjg4Q19hXzFhX3c&usp=sharing


If you have any suggestions for other excellent, established open
scientists please add them directly to the above spreadsheet with
supporting details of how/why they represent open science and links. Also,
better descriptions of why they're open are very welcome!

Elsewise, feel free to discuss nominations further on-list here.

Some guide examples:

John Sulston - Strong advocate and supporter of open data in science. Nobel
Prize Winner
Harold E. Varmus - Champion of Open Access and PMC. Nobel Prize Winner
Michael Ashburner - reknowned open science advocate & Benjamin Franklin
Award Winner
Michael Eisen -  reknowned open science advocate & Benjamin Franklin Award
Winner



Best,

Ross

Hi everyone,

I have just joined that mailing list, and as suggested on the open science
page, this is just an email to introduce myself.

I am the founder of the Supernode Foundation <http://thesupernode.org> - a
non-profit aimed at created a single open global platform for computation,
connecting data, visualisation and functions through a node-based web
interface.

A recent talk I gave on the subject is
here<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWoJyrijPO4>,
if anyone fancies taking a look.

I'm looking forward to taking part in some interesting conversations on the
subject with people on this list.

Hi all,

I've been lurking on this list for a bit. I've been wondering if there
are any okfn open science enthusiasts in Chicago. I know some diybio
and diy-other  other folks, but would like to meet people who like to
talk about reproducible research, best practices and helping to
education people about them. and also helping to write tools for these
things. I just got a job related to this, so I am extra excited.

moves towards open science that things haven't moved faster!

After a quick pass through Refine that looks to be 90 unique Laureats.
 I'll reconcile them against Freebase to get their Wikipedia pages and post
the composite spreadsheet on Google Docs.

Unfortunately he died last year. :(

He was organizing meetings at ps1 (one of the hackerspaces here) about
open science in the sense of doing science that is open. People in the
group wanted to create a science lab at ps1 for doing research.

There is a reasonable number of people in the mailing list they set
up, but it hasn't been active in a while. But there will be overlap in
terms of interest! so if there are any okfn hackathons or other local
events, I will cross post.
