Ah just heard it was 1500. Can pop out for either time, may have to head back to EDINA afterwards...

Hi Jo,

You're on for a Repofringe roundtable on Thursday after lunch, 2-3.

If that's not okay, let Stuart know asap and he might be able to switch you with another roundtable on Wed. but the final programme is going up in the morning and the person you would switch with is an out-of-towner.

Programme at http://rfringe11.blogs.edina.ac.uk/programme/

cheers,

Glad of the responses. Perhaps we are looking for a declaration rather than a definition. To say "we are doing Open Scholarship because we are doing X and Y". Then wouldnt have to be too exhaustive or qualified...

Not sure when is the session planned for? Am otherwise engaged on the 4th most of the day :/

This is part of why I'm not comfortable making a more formal definition of the term. I especially like Cameron's last sentence! Cheers, Michael

Two posts about Open Science Summit 2011.

I was invited to this last year and it was great. (If you haven't seen it,
this was my "Flowerpoint" contribution and greeting from the OKF
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2010/09/14/oss2010-recording-of-my-open-science-summit-flowerpoint-at-berkeley/).

================

Dear participants of the Open Science Summit 2010,

my name is Lorenzo Albanello, I'm helping Joseph Jackson in the organization
of the Open Science Summit 2011. Among other things, to promote the summit I
would like to make a brief video that contains little clips of your
interviews taken on the hallway of UC Berkeley during the previous summit.
Watching those interviews I found that your responses brought up something
very interesting about the importance of openness in science, that we would
love to have in this teaser for the new summit. Are you ok with that?

The organization of the new summit is entering its hectic phase now,
sponsors and speakers will be finalized in August. We are hoping to have you
join us again in Mountain View, Oct 22-23.

sincerely

Thanks Peter.  We certainly wish you can join us in October but we will be
in touch about future activities and will try to work much more closely with
the Open Knowledge Foundation from now on.  Planning to join the working
group call Weds and get feedback from you during the lead up to the Summit.
 We'll probably want to interview you again and get additional footage
during 2012 as we work on the documentary.
Joseph

Wonderful, thanks for this Peter.  Look forward to talking on Weds at which
time we'll have a good idea of what the program looks like for this year and
how we can best work with Open Knowledge Foundation.

We have put forward sessions at Science Online London which are exploring
the idea of Open Research Reports (ORRs) - collections of Open material
(papers, bibliography, data) related to selected subjects - e.g. disease.
http://www.scienceonlinelondon.org/programme.html
We are continuing this with a pre-workshop hackfest at SemWeb Applic. and
Tools for Life Sci http://www.swat4ls.org/ where we intend to continue to
create ORRs.

We think that ORRs are a very good way for people outside mainstream
academia to get involved as the literature is - by definition - Open. It's a
black mark for academia that so much of their output is hidden - we hope
that this initiative will help to change that

	policy for publications
Message-ID: <CAMH9oT5oJfgqVAAkPEoh5t_LYdjRKrohS0Hdfih7YgWn-dGcuw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey All,

Just spotted the link below and thought might be of interest to both
open-development and open-science list members:

http://blogs.cgdev.org/globaldevelopment/2011/08/cgds-new-data-code-transparency-policy.php

The Centre for Global Development have adopted a new policy of publishing
data and code alongside their research outputs, and David's post invites
comment on the policy and outlines some of the issues they've been exploring
in developing it. Brief extract from the policy below (
http://www.cgdev.org/doc/blog/globaldevelopment/CGD%20Data+code%20transparency%20policy.pdf
)

"CGD analyses should be acts of social science. By some definitions, a *sine
qua non* of science is replicability. The responsibility for replicability
is especially great for research that aims to influence policy and
ultimately affect the lives of the poor. Bruce McCullough and Ross McKitrick
put it well in their report, Check the Numbers: The Case for Due Diligence
in Policy Formation <http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~bdm25/DueDiligence.pdf>:

When a piece of academic research takes on a public role, such as becoming
the basis for public policy decisions, practices that obstruct independent
replication, such as refusal to disclose data, or the concealment of details
about computational methods, prevent the proper functioning of the
scientific process and can lead to poor public decision making.

In fact, transparency has many benefits:

   - It makes analysis more credible.
   - It makes CGD more credible when it calls on other organizations, such
   as aid agencies, to be transparent.
   - Data and code are additional content, appreciated by certain audiences.
   - It increases citation of CGD publications?by people using associated
   data sets.
   - It curates, saving work that otherwise tends to get lost as the staff
   turns over.
   - Preparing code and data for public sharing improves the quality of
   research: researchers find bugs.
   - In the short term, CGD?s leadership in transparency will differentiate
   it from its peers. In the long term (one hopes), CGD?s leadership will raise
   standards elsewhere."

All the best,

Tim

Hi Tim

I feel very close the issue. I was hoping to be able to use some of
the raw data for a JISC funded resarch (a report by keyperspectives)
since I would like to analyse their data according to different
criteria, however it turns out that the original data has been
destroyed. (see the exchange below)

This prompted me to learn more of what does the JISC policy mandate in
relation to data preservation, and believe it or not, nobody has been
able to give a straight
answer yet  -  it does not seem to be written anywhere (that I could
find) Another paradox  ?
advice welcome :-)

it's a pity that the records were not kept in anonymous form, so
thatthey could be further analysed and the data manipulated .queried
differently

Isnt there a  legal requirement that research data record are kept for
a number of years?

it would also be interesting to be able to verify/cross validate your
findings, but without the original data, this will be impossible

I will then use your summary/conclusion as a reference

I must say that my own findings (enclose an overview of my research to
date) confirm your conclusions, however I have so far performedlimited
field work, and was hoping to be able to re-use your data(anonymous
would also be Okay) to spare myself further data collection

Hi,

I threw this together last night, and put it up as a "poster" at Balisage, the Markup conference (ongoing as I write):

I had hoped to spend more time on it and send out this email earlier to solicit suggestions, but I just didn't have time.  So it is not as strong as I would have liked.

My idea is basically that opening up the article XML formats to ease the ability to do extensions and customizations can help the cause of open science.  In practice, there's a lot of resistance to making or allowing customizations to, in particular, the JATS (NLM DTDs), and so this is a poster to try to confront that inertia.

I expect to get some push-back (actually, I expect it mostly to be ignored - if I get some push-back, I'd be very happy).  So I'm sending this email to open-science in case any readers here want to discuss it:  http://friendfeed.com/klortho/3273b6a2

 > Projects we should follow up/assist/otherwise get involved with.

Dear Jenny and all,
at the call in June and promised I would briefly introduce 
BioSharing, one of the activities I co-lead with Dawn Field (of 
NERC-NEBC). Sorry for the long delay, a summary is now below.
I will try to join today's call; I also strongly support open data and 
your goals. In particular I believe we need 'standardized descriptions' 
of the datasets so that these are understandable, reusable and (in 
principle) reproducible; hence the creation of a catalogue of standards, 
under BioSharing as a starting point.
I would be happy to explore links between the goals of BioSharing and 
this group.
Thanks,
Susanna

BioSharing: policies, standards and communication in bioscience
***
Several data management, sharing policies and plans have emerged in 
response to increased funding for high-throughput approaches in genomics 
and functional genomics bioscience (e.g. 1). In parallel, a growing 
number of community-based groups are developing standards (minimal 
reporting requirements, terminologies and exchange formats) to harmonize 
the reporting of different experiments, so that these can be 
comprehensible and in principle reproduced, compared or integrated (2). 
A bewildering array of standards is available, but these are hard to 
find, at different levels of maturity; in some areas duplications or 
gaps in coverage also exist.

BioSharing (3) works at the global level to build stable linkages in 
particular between journals, funders, implementing data sharing 
policies, and well-constituted standardization efforts in the 
biosciences domain, to expedite the communication and the production of 
an integrated standards-based framework for the capture and sharing of 
high-throughput genomics and functional genomic bioscience data, in 
particular. BioSharing is an open-membership organization (4) that works 
to achieve its objective via a web-based catalogues a communication 
forum and annual meetings. BioSharing extends the MIBBI effort (5) - 
already known by several journals - and has already several endorsements 
(6,7).

I have copied Kaitlin who is one of the key people. I know that last year
some of the bits were streamed. We had some personal streaming in our own
(green chain reaction) but somehow it didn'tQuiteWork or got lost.

I think this will start to take off rapidly. There's an N^2 effect in
getting awareness. The point is that ORR is actually an incredibly simple
concept. We just need to get people doing it. I could take off in many
areas.

One really exciting thing is that grad students can often make enormous
progress. I've just listened to Mark Hanel on Figshare. The whole thing was
done in < 1 year, while he was doing his PhD. ORR could feed off Figshare
and vice versa. We could assemble the key diagrams for - say - malaria - in
an ORR. That's a really valuable resource for people learning the field or
perhaps needing to train others or wanting reference material or whatever.
There can be a N^2 effect with Figshare/ORR - who knows. We just have to do
it.

Paolo, Key Perspectives are independent  consultants, so not subject to FoI except where they hold data on behalf of others, including JISC who commissioned this work. I have some sympathy for their practice; qualitative data are often this kind of one to one interview data and potentially very sensitive. It was not unreasonable practice for them to promise to delete those interview recordings or transcripts. I'm not sure what Qualidata guidelines are, but I doubt that interview transcripts are ever made freely available.

OTOH I don't think JISC has a formal policy on retention of underlying data; it does have policies on openness, and on retention of outputs. It might be worth pressing them. Even so, the privacy issues in qualitative data would need to be taken into account.

I suggested that the data could be anonymized instead of being
destroyed  - so that I would not have to know the name of the person,
but still have an idea of their demographics, for example - job title,
institution,department, city, town etc. I would really like to analyse
such data according to different segmentation in relation to
geographical differences for example, would there be differences
between north and south, or between different institutions, and
disciplines, as this could serve the public good and provide
additional science for the same buck.

I am currently carrying out similar research, and I have nowhere near
the budget that JISC provides for this kind of reports to be
researched and published, and I have to rely with much more notional
datasets (smaller samples) . I even hitchike and camp outdoors to be
able to collect my data within my budget

so yes, privacy of interviewees should be protected, but the data
should be kept in anonymised form for both validation/replication, as
well as for further manipulation

the two do not have to be mutually exclusive, if the management of
science is properly handled,

to have no record at all is also not good practice, for the reasons
stated in the due diligence article Tim posted

It is generally recognized that it is impossible to anonymize data
completely

See
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin.ars

with the quote:

As Ohm notes, this illustrates a central reality of data collection: "data
can either be useful or perfectly anonymous but never both."

Thank you Peter for the nice quote

sure, 'privacy' cannot actually be taken lightly

However being a pragmatic scientist, having to make a choice, I would
necessarily aim for (esp re data paid for with public money)  it being
useful, and imperfectly anonymous (or as some would put it, anonymous
enough...)

Even the need for privacy must be weighted against
the context, I mean privacy of personal data (ie, my bank pin, genetic
code, phone calls record or clinical and health data etc) are a
stronger requirement than the need to protect my legitimate views on
'open access' aired in the context of a scientific enquiry the results
of which will be published in aggregated and anonymized form.

Especially not in the case of subjects who  otherwise take every
opportunity to make their views known....

From: metazool at fastmail.net (Jo Walsh)
Date: Fri, 05 Aug 2011 10:43:19 +0100
Subject: [open-science] Notes from Open Scholarship at Repo Fringe
Message-ID: <4E3BBB37.7010509@fastmail.net>

The piratepad from the hour-long "Round Table":

http://okfnpad.org/rfringe11-open-scholarship

The top few lines are Mark's summary of the "principles" as far as we 
could get them in this discussion session (5 seems to duplicate 2?):

1. open scholarship is a move beyond open access
2. it is a commitment to produce scholarly work with the intention of 
sharing it with the world
3. open scholarship enables the ideal of scholarship by using currently 
available tools to the full, for that ideal
4. when scholarship is open, the creative works of the world will be 
made freely available to everyone as widely as possible
5. open scholarship - scholarship for the world

Things that jumped out at me:
- the difficulty in agreeing what "open access" is
- the sense that some principles in Open Science may not be digestible 
by the humanities (that there may be disagreement *simply because* a 
declaration may be perceived as too science-led)
- the importance of accounting for the needs of / problems faced by 
scholars in "less developed" countries (and the innovations coming from 
this direction - e.g. http://www.osdd.org/ led by Indian team.

So next steps, refining Mark's summary of the principles, putting a 
draft declaration together that James Toon can re-use for the meeting, 
next month, to update the OATS declaration on Open Access for Scottish 
universities...

How does BioSharing stand towards non-bio sciences? Like chemistry?

Message-ID: <0DBF2BD4A4CE9B45B8A90A65CD8338EA03F1F310@SEGBLOGR0008.springer-sbm.com>

Dear all,

A report from the BioMed Central-led Publishing Open Data Working Group
meeting, held on 17th June, was posted on the BMC Blog earlier this
week:

http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/report_from_the_p
ublishing_open

(and also discussed at last week's working group meeting). The meeting
was attended by several members of the Open Science working group. I'm
pleased to report that there were a number of mutually agreeable ways
forward. There are many things for the attendees to do after the meeting
and opportunities for collaboration. Some of the major outcomes include:

1. BioMed Central to lead on drafting a white paper providing much more
detail on the process, policy and implications of a variable licensing
agreement for published articles and additional (supplementary) files.
This will be made available for a defined period of internal/public
discussion.

2. The creation of some basic guidelines on preparing/publishing
additional (supplementary) files. Comprehensive information on "what do
we mean by data?" wasn't deemed necessary (or possible) but some basic
principles might be useful e.g. supplementary tables should not be
provided as PDF files.

3. Publishers to include some information in peer reviewer guidelines
about the expectations of peer reviewers when considering manuscripts
with additional (supplementary) data files. Currently there is little or
no information on if or how reviewers should handle additional data
files in BMC, PLoS, BMJ and Nature guidelines.

4. Agreement to work towards increased use of data sharing statements in
published articles.

If anyone in this group sees any possible area of collaboration please
contact me.

Kind regards,

Iain

Hi Egon,
But do you have specific idea in mind or similar/sister projects in 
chemistry we should link to?
So we want to be inclusive but (i) do not duplicate where thing exists 
and (ii) keep the focus/center is on bioscience, so in this case 
biochemistry would certainly fit.
Thanks,
Susanna

No smilar project in mind. The context is this request from Matthew:

http://intermolecular.wordpress.com/2011/08/07/raw-data-in-organic-chemistry-papersopen-science/

I would think BioSharing could also act as registry for formats in
chemistry. In fact, I did not check, but assume this will
automatically result in an ontology... I think there would be a good
chance we'd use that in ToxBank, which is actually very much bio
oriented, rather than chemistry.

Hi Egon,

many thanks for the link.

Sure and actually with e.g. NMR being used in metabolomics and MS in 
both  metabolomics and proteomics, these do fit into the bioarea too.

We also solicit submissions of 'standards' via a simple form at: 
http://biosharing.org/contact. Individuals are also acknowledged - along 
with collaborators- at http://biosharing.org/communities

Thanks,
Susanna

Let's just go ahead as quickly as possible. Much of the chemistry is
actively used in bio-informatics - e.g. in ChEBI. FWIW see our Chemical MIME
(http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemime/iupac.html ) which has worked well and
continues to work in chemistry.

There's also lots of discussion on http://blueobelisk.shapado.com/ and the
Blue Obelisk mailing list.

Hi Peter,

happy to help, as we can, if you also believe we can list this in the 
BioSharing catalogue. There are 2 ways to add these:
- via simple form at: http://biosharing.org/contact (individuals 
submitting are also acknowledged - along with collaborators and their 
logo/links- at http://biosharing.org/communities)
- or if somebody has a list already, e.g. in an spreadsheet, we can 
quickly 'curate' it and batch loaded these.

As we say on the site "In this/first phase/, each entry will be curated 
by the BioSharing team for consistency, and individual contributors will 
be acknowledged. In the/next phases/, we will allow individuals 
(nominated by groups developing and maintaining policies or standards) 
to login and edit/update relevant entries. The final goal is to ensure 
the catalogues represents an up-to-date reference set for those seeking 
information on policies and standards."

Thanks,
Susanna

We have a list in an HTML table:
http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/chemime/

This is probably the most up to date.

This will be useful. We can either use Shapado or your own wiki, etc.

basics things, as the external links and the 'Domain(s) covered'. On the 
latter, we are working to create a vocabulary to classify these (many 
exists and the plan is to reuse them, as much as possible).

This looks interesting - they stress that it is not just big science - so
there is opportunity to stress tools that deal with the long tail as well

 Greetings,

The Science Program at the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation is excited to
announce a request for ideas in the domain of Data Intensive Science.  This
RFI is open now, here: *http://dis.ideascale.com* <http://dis.ideascale.com>

The increasing volume and complexity of scientific data are overwhelming
current research practices, and create additional barriers to an already
challenged science infrastructure, workforce and funding landscape.  Many
agencies and foundations are looking at ways to best combat the growing wave
of challenges caused by today?s data deluge, and the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation?s RFI on Data Intensive Science is intended to add to this
growing body of thinking.  This RFI is being conducted in the open and for
the benefit of anyone looking to navigate these areas.  The Science Program
will review the ideas, comments and votes generated as we conduct our
strategic planning processes this year.

We encourage you and your colleagues to participate in this RFI through the
middle of September, 2011.  Please note that this is not a proposal
solicitation, and there is no promise of funding in this area. However, we
encourage you to add your suggestions and comments here *
http://dis.ideascale.com* <http://dis.ideascale.com> .  Your contributions
will help the Science Program find areas of investment that can make the
most difference in the domain of Data Intensive Science.

If you would like more information on this request for ideas, please visit
the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation?s web site at *
http://www.moore.org/science-rfi.aspx*<http://www.moore.org/science-rfi.aspx>

Subject: [open-science] UK Government to introduce copyright exceptions for
	data and text mining
Message-ID: <CABPM+wqM_K_KBYTFAODQ-NsXEtLECrsxVLWGC1bMB-n6MRoSbQ@mail.gmail.com>

http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/08/data_mining_given_the_go_ahead.html

Full report here:
http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/innovation/docs/g/11-1199-government-response-to-hargreaves-review
 [pdf]

"The Government sees the areas where copyright restricts activity to no
direct commercial benefit as doubly wasteful: neither new opportunities nor
incentive to invest in copyright works result from them. Nor does the
Government regard it as appropriate for certain activities of public benefit
such as medical research obtained through text mining to be in effect
subject to veto by the owners of copyrights in the reports of such research,
where access to the reports was obtained lawfully. We recognise that some
publishers view licensing of text mining as a legitimate commercial
opportunity; however we are not persuaded that restricting this
transformative use of copyright material is necessary or in the UK?s overall
economic interest."

Not being a lawyer, I have no idea how far this will impact what publishers
are allowed to ban in their license agreements with institutions, which as
we've discussed on the list before is where the mining restrictions are
often found (often banning use of all automated indexing/searching/mining
tools and citing server load issues) and involve contract rather than
copyright law.

This is indeed very serious progress if it can be got through. There is going to be massive lobbying against the implementation of this, and it also appears likely that it will be legally difficult to implement. What we'll get will be strictly limited to non-commercial activities which isn't where we'd like to be but is at least progress. It will enable the kinds of things that Peter has been wanting to do for ages at least.

In the meantime there is a need for real hard evidence of existing damage and future possibilities. I've been approached to see if we can pull some more concrete evidence together to bolster the case. In particular we need any evidence of _specific_ damage. Things not done that could be done (ideally even under an NC regime) and things that _very clearly would_ happen if the proposed rules go through. Also any economic modelling on the benefits under either an NC or fully open regime would be very useful. Comments from highly successful overseas researchers or professionals who would shift their operation to the UK if such a system were brought in would also be useful.

All of this has to focus on issues and opportunities raised specifically by copyright, and not by access. The inquiry and proposed legislation is about reforming copyright not access so we need to be clear about the distinction there.

Hi All

Just to let you know we now have a page for local groups interested in open
science.
htttp://science.okfn.org/local-groups/<http://science.okfn.org/local-groups/>

Currently featuring MIT, Stockholm and the (hopefully) soon to be
established Oxford group. Let me know if you have info on more groups or
would like to start one, as I can put an entry inviting interest. These do
not need to be directly affiliated with OKF but as Jonathan pointed out in
an earlier email, once they are up and running we can offer

   - local mailing lists via lists.okfn.org
   - local groups e.g. http://okfn.org/groups/open-knowledge-london/
   - local websites e.g. science.okfn.org

The Stockholm Open Science group members (three of them) have
indicated to be most happy with hosting via the OKFN, and I will
shortly start setting up various things.

For now, the group is indeed the place to go, and we're going to meet
once a month in a series of lunch meetings, starting in a few weeks.

Grtz,

Egon

Seeing this page, I got the idea to try to start an open-science local interest group in the Washington, DC area.  I've introduced myself to this group before - I work at PMC on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD.  I think a DC group could potentially be a big win for pushing the cause of open-science at US government institutions, including the NIH.

I've never tried to do something quite like this before, so I'd really like to get suggestions for the best way to go about it.  Here are some specific questions:

-          Do you think it's a good idea?

-          Would it be best to get a select group of people committed to the idea first, before sending out any kind of announcement?

-          More generally, any advice on the timing of rolling it out, so as hopefully to draw the most interest, would be appreciated.

-          Anyone else on this list who's interested in helping on this group specifically?

-          Could I get help setting up a mailing list / web site?  (Maybe we don't need a web site at first).

-          Could I get help drafting up an announcement?  I think I would send it to the NCBI staff, once it's ready.

-          Any advice on how to run the group - details of running meetings, etc.

Cheers!

I can say that for the Stockholm group, we are starting pretty small.
Because holiday had already started, the first meeting was just with
me and a former colleague :)

We just started and we'll see this autumn if it really takes off.
Prognoses are good, though, and it seems to me that (gold) Open Access
has been very successful in taking the 'Open' idea to a next level,
where Open Source did not quite have the same effect... this is more
an personal perception than a factual observation.

Since you are in the neighborhood, you might be interested in this
meeting in Frederick (hosted by NCI), where you'll find similarly
minded people. I know from Rajarshi Guha (NIH something, cc-ed) that
several people from NIH will be at that meeting, and perhaps even
colleagues? (dunno the NIH organizational structure really).

We're taking an informal, we-all-wanna-learn-and-share-experiences
approach. Networking first, and then action will come automatically.
Well, that's my idea here in Stockholm :)

Not necessarily, as Egon says you can start off very informally. I've
mentioned the Oxford one, because I know there are people who are
potentially interested but as of yet no one else is officially on board! To
give you my plan for rolling out, we have an open community pub meet planned
next week and I'll enlist any scientists that come along and try to arrange
a science specific event. We'll then try and hold a larger launch event once
several people are already involved. This isn't really advice because I
don't know yet whether it will work, but it's an idea!

Yes! You can email okfn-help at okfn.org and this list to ask that one is set
up and the admins will sort it out.

If you send a draft/link to a draft to the list I'm sure people will join in
helping to edit. I can set you up an okfnpad for collaborative drafting if
you like. It would be useful for other people who might like to set
something similar up to read and reuse.

Not currently, but I think the most important thing is to follow the
interests of the people you manage to get involved, because being able to do
that is the main benefit of having smaller local groups. Egon and I can both
keep you informed about how our plans pan out, what works and doesn't for
us. OKF tends towards 'doing stuff' meetings so I guess you'd want a mixture
of talking about what you want to happen and workshops/hack sessions to get
it done. That is what I'll be attempting to do here.

Hi All

The OKF was approached recently by PLoS Biology to write a piece on the
working group for their Community pages. I've drafted one, and it would be
great if some of you could take a look and comment!
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-PLoSBiology
Please make edits, add comments throughout the text or at the end.

Things to note:
It is requested that we don't use this entirely as a self promotion activity
and therefore focus mainly on a few things we do as opposed to listing them
all, so I've tried to find a balance whilst including enough activities to
demonstrate the breadth of our scope. The focus is:
The Open Definition
The Panton Principles
I have taken it as our position that we support the idea that scientific
data should be open by default according to the Panton Principles (with all
the usual caveats for privacy, special cases etc). I'm pretty sure that this
reflects the views of most of the group, but I have mentioned that we are a
diverse bunch :)

I'd particularly like comments on:
Have I made it clear enough that the piece is discussing data associated
with published science (as per the PP)?
Are there interesting cases/examples/analogies that you think would fit in
the piece?
Any general comments on content or style
Please be frank - this is a great opportunity to get some exposure for the
group (and make us citeable) so we want this to be as good as possible.

Thanks very much for your help!

Jenny

Hi Christopher!

Seeing this page, I got the idea to try to start an open-science local interest group in the Washington, DC area.  I've introduced myself to this group before - I work at PMC on the NIH campus in Bethesda, MD.  I think a DC group could potentially be a big win for pushing the cause of open-science at US government institutions, including the NIH.

I've never tried to do something quite like this before, so I'd really like to get suggestions for the best way to go about it.  Here are some specific questions:

-          Do you think it's a good idea?
Yes!

-          Would it be best to get a select group of people committed to the idea first, before sending out any kind of announcement?

-          More generally, any advice on the timing of rolling it out, so as hopefully to draw the most interest, would be appreciated.
Not necessarily, as Egon says you can start off very informally. I've mentioned the Oxford one, because I know there are people who are potentially interested but as of yet no one else is officially on board! To give you my plan for rolling out, we have an open community pub meet planned next week and I'll enlist any scientists that come along and try to arrange a science specific event. We'll then try and hold a larger launch event once several people are already involved. This isn't really advice because I don't know yet whether it will work, but it's an idea!

-          Anyone else on this list who's interested in helping on this group specifically?

-          Could I get help setting up a mailing list / web site?  (Maybe we don't need a web site at first).
Yes! You can email okfn-help at okfn.org<mailto:okfn-help at okfn.org> and this list to ask that one is set up and the admins will sort it out.

-          Could I get help drafting up an announcement?  I think I would send it to the NCBI staff, once it's ready.
If you send a draft/link to a draft to the list I'm sure people will join in helping to edit. I can set you up an okfnpad for collaborative drafting if you like. It would be useful for other people who might like to set something similar up to read and reuse.

-          Any advice on how to run the group - details of running meetings, etc.
Not currently, but I think the most important thing is to follow the interests of the people you manage to get involved, because being able to do that is the main benefit of having smaller local groups. Egon and I can both keep you informed about how our plans pan out, what works and doesn't for us. OKF tends towards 'doing stuff' meetings so I guess you'd want a mixture of talking about what you want to happen and workshops/hack sessions to get it done. That is what I'll be attempting to do here.

Jenny

Cheers!

Hi All

Just to let you know we now have a page for local groups interested in open science.
htttp://science.okfn.org/local-groups/<http://science.okfn.org/local-groups/>

Currently featuring MIT, Stockholm and the (hopefully) soon to be established Oxford group. Let me know if you have info on more groups or would like to start one, as I can put an entry inviting interest. These do not need to be directly affiliated with OKF but as Jonathan pointed out in an earlier email, once they are up and running we can offer
*  local mailing lists via lists.okfn.org<http://lists.okfn.org>
*  local groups e.g. http://okfn.org/groups/open-knowledge-london/
*  local websites e.g. science.okfn.org<http://science.okfn.org>

Agreed. It may be worth pointing out that the OKF(-science) can act as a
tool to collect and refine opintions and protocols. Unlike real-life
meetings where the attendence is based on protoplasm, this approach allows
anyone to participate. However the "product" is a considerable refinement of
the ideas that went in. OKF takes its output quality seriously.

I agree we shouldn't advertise ourselves per se but it is worth making it
clear that OKF can have a role to play as a formal part in the development
of new protocols and approaches.

Hi All

Check out the notes from the 3 Aug working group meeting on the blog:
http://science.okfn.org/2011/08/14/353/
Also copied below for convenience!

Jenny

See below for a summary of key points from the WG meeting on Aug 3 2011,
followed by a list of interesting events that are coming up. If you?d like
more detailed updates on projects or to view the full minutes, visit the
meeting Etherpad <http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-3Aug2011>.

The next meeting will be Wednesday 7 September, 17:30 GMT. You can sign up
and add agenda items here <http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-7Sep2011>.
 UPDATES:

   1. *Royal Society Science as a Public Enterprise Submission*
   Thank you to all those who joined in the Skype call on this and
   contributed to the notes and draft. You can view our submission
here<http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-RS-SAPE>
   .
   2. *Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science*
   As detailed in a previous blog
post<http://science.okfn.org/2011/07/26/wikimedian-in-residence-on-open-science/>,
   Daniel Meitchen is now the Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science. OKF
   Germany are the host and there is a lot of incentive for us to collaborate.
   You can read Daniel?s detailed rundown of the
opportunities<http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2011-July/000899.html>
for
   the group to get involved and check out what has been achieved so
far<http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedian_in_Residence_on_Open_Science/Outcomes>
   ..
   3. *Panton Principles Case Studies*
   Three case studies have been drafted
here<http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-PPcasestudies> on
   the Human Genome Project, Kepler Mission and 2011 BMC Open Data Award
   winners. Please take a look and improve them if you can, or add
   suggestions/drafts of more.
   4. *Panton Papers*
   There are still Panton Papers being drafted which you can contribute to
   or comment on, check out the links below for more!
   Data Sharing
Requirements<http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Panton_Papers/Data_sharing_requirements>

   Text Mining <http://okfnpad.org/PPDataTextMining>
   5. *Encouraging local open science groups and meet up*
   A new local groups page <http://science.okfn.org/local-groups/> has been
   added to science.okfn.org. Building local open science communities is a
   great way to meet people, generate ideas, organise workshops and get things
   done so do think about joining or starting one in your local area!
   6. *Publishing Open Data Working Group*
   Iain Hrynaszkiewicz from BioMedCentral reported on the outcomes of this
   BMC led workshop
here<http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/report_from_the_publishing_open>
and
   sent a call to the list for collaboration
here<http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2011-August/000933.html>.
   If you are interested in the approach to open data from the scientific
   publishers perspective then this should be of considerable interest.
   7. *Biosharing*
   Susanna Sansone recently introduced the
Biosharing.org<http://biosharing.org/> initiative
   to the list<http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2011-August/000924.html>.
   This community aims to create a catalogue of Biological data standards and
   is in collaboration<http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/bmc_research_notes_and_biosharing>with
   publishers such as BMC to include links to the site in their author
   instructions.

   Iain pointed out that BMC is waiving publication fees for exemplar data
   sets to encourage useful data sharing. BMC Research Notes has a data
   sharing article
collection<http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcresnotes/series/datasharing>edited
   by Dr Bill Hooker, Dr Heather Piwowar and Dr David Shotton (who are all
   members or otherwise associated with the working group).

   More suggestions of standards for the catalogue and groups interested in
   publishing datasets in BMC Research Notes are encouraged.
   8. *Open Science/Open Data at Science Conferences*
   Iain Hrynaszkiewicz is keen to find out whether open science and open
   data in science are presented at conferences that are not specifically aimed
   at the open community. If you have seen it done, have entered a proposal or
   know of any others who have then do start a conversation on the
list<http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-science>.
   It would be useful to compare experiences to find out how best to approach
   this and get more exposure for the ideas of open data/open science.

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEyVj_QKh+G5StYDmcTZG_0BmDM548XJRBDASspGEoGOug@mail.gmail.com>

Forgive me if you only see this as tangentially-related to Open Science,
but in my opinion, the proper accreditation of data providers (via
citation or some other value-metric) is integral to the feasibility &
promotion of free and Open data sharing. I don't know how well
citation works outside of Biological Sciences, but I can tell you from
my own observations that it is a BIG problem in a lot of Biology
papers.

*justification over*

I thought it might be good to alert you all to this publication:

Kueffer et al (2011) Fame, glory and neglect in meta-analyses. TrEE
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534711002059

They make some great points that I've informally made before (e.g.
DryadUK meeting, at the BL, April 1st 2011) and that no doubt many
others have also noticed - that the data sources used in
meta-analytical papers often don't get counted by 'services' such as
ISI Web of Science, therefore those original data providers receive no
credit for this additional usage of their data. Papers looking across
say 15 other studies will likely give *proper* ISI-counted citations,
whereas those looking across 100 will most likely not, for reasons of
space.

The same problem often occurs with citations buried in electronic
supplementary materials.
Nature warn their authors about this problem:

"Please note that we do not encourage deposition of references within
SI as they will not be live links and will not contribute towards
citation measures for the papers concerned."
http://www.nature.com/nature/authors/submissions/final/suppinfo.html

...but yet in virtually all papers I look at with SI there are
references therein:

e.g. http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09181
or http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature09704   (I could easily find 1000+
examples across many different journals that allow electronic SI)

Not a good situation!

This new paper is a welcome contribution (if slightly blinkered to the
true far larger scale and scope of this problem, restricting
themselves to just ecological meta-analyses) to raising awareness of
this problem and hopefully changing citation culture so that
researchers get credit, where credit is due.


Is this within the remit / related to Open Science? I hope so...
Is there anything that can be done from the publisher side of things?
It seems like this paper is perhaps unfairly putting the burden of
responsibility on the authors of meta-analyses, rather than on
publishers who I imagine could easily (surely?) let ISI count ESM/SI
citations. Why does this issue even exist in 2011 (the Digitial
Age)!?!?

Regards,

Ross

With some publishers, yes. I would expect. I can't speak for them directly
but several are promoting Openness and open Data and this seems completely
mainstream.

With other publishers where "enduser" == "the purchasing office in a
university" this is probably only seen as an additional cost which reduces
shareholder value.

Oh dear, please don't get me started. Because the motivation of many
publishers is not to serve the process of publication but to generate income
and cuts costs. Any innovation will raise costs and not necessarily generate
income so why should they do it? The main motivation is "when everyone else
does it"

Great! I've been conscious I've been rather quiet on this list so far.

As a meta-analyst myself I'm genuinely concerned that when I come to
publish my analyses - the original authors who in some cases even took
the time themselves to send me their datasets and explain things about
them to; just won't get the credit they deserve, even though I myself
am extremely happy and really *want* to give them that deserved
credit.

Original authors of primary datasets are the very lifeblood of my
research, so I'd go to great lengths to keep them happy with how I use
& cite their data.

But depending on which journal I submit to, it seems thoroughly out of
my hands; even as an author it seems I have little control over this
problem (another hangover from the age of Paper-only publishing?)!
Needless to say as a very early career researcher I can't afford to
pick and choose where I publish for the sake of issues like this -
even if I am fully cognisant of them.

Gold OA, or not. Proper credit giving citations, or not. Open Data, or
not... It seems scholarly authors have a lot of choices, and it's all
too easy to passively choose "not" (~lazy / bad) atm.   :S

Panton paper or similar when we come to discuss Open Data. I know some
people are concerned about the recursive acknolwedgement cascade (e.g. if
people cite your meta-analysis should they also attribute the sources you
have used.) There is no simple answer.

Agreed. I think that getting buy-in from responsible publishers is an
important way forward.

It is hard to put in proactive effort when there is no community norm and no
good tools to help. If there was a button which implicitly said "cite these
sources recursively" then most people would probably do it.

There is a different between acknowledgment and citation. A simple
acknowledgment is could be "I thank the authors listed in document X and
acknowledge that this is their work". That makes it claer - on inspection by
humans - who actually did the work. The problem is that "citations"have
grown into this hideous, imprecise currency. There is no mechanism for using
it properly - we are reduced to accepting the stuff that comes out of
commercial companies who have no fundamental business motive to ensure it is
either useful, relevant or accurate. I have been supplied with "citations"
from commercial companies where my name was used for someone else's title.
OK, this is not common, but it shows the system is fundamentally broken. I
am less concerned about author ID (OK, I am unique) than transparency of the
process and the ability to create innovations.

But there is no incentive for the supplying companies to innovate. They have
a monopoly and people buy their products.

Hi Ross!

> Is this within the remit / related to Open Science? I hope so...

As Peter says, it definitely ties into open data. People are more
likely to publish their data if they know they'll receive credit upon
reuse, which under the current reward system usually means a citation.

> Is there anything that can be done from the publisher side of things?

BioMedCentral are putting together a set of guidelines for additional
supplementary files which we can feed this into. This is following on
from an Open Data workshop with representatives from many other
publishers (BMJ, NPG, PLoS and more) so hopefully will be taken notice
of! http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/report_from_the_publishing_open

random:

http://pubs.acs.org/doi/suppl/10.1021/jo200117p/suppl_file/jo200117p_si_003.pdf

It's simply called "PDF". Where are the citations? They are actually
footnotes in this case. Sometimes they are in bitmaps

In the main text the citations are "standardized" by the publishers (i.e.
every publisher does it consistently within the publisher but completely
different from each other)  and probably the robots can get a reasonable
amount without too many garbles. In the suppdata it's whatever anyone puts
in.

And, remember that with a few execeptions, publishers regard suppdata as a
cost without benefits.

Hi All

The notes from the 3 Aug working group meeting are now up on science.okfn.org
http://science.okfn.org/2011/08/14/353/
Text is copied below but please click through for the linked version.

The next meeting will be Wednesday 7 September, 17:30 GMT. You can
sign up and add agenda items at http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-7Sep2011

Thanks!

Jenny

# Royal Society Science as a Public Enterprise Submission
Thank you to all those who joined in the Skype call on this and
contributed to the notes and draft. You can view our submission here.

# Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science
As detailed in a previous blog post, Daniel Meitchen is now the
Wikimedian in Residence on Open Science. OKF Germany are the host and
there is a lot of incentive for us to collaborate. You can read
Daniel?s detailed rundown of the opportunities for the group to get
involved and check out what has been achieved so far..

# Panton Principles Case Studies
Three case studies have been drafted here on the Human Genome Project,
Kepler Mission and 2011 BMC Open Data Award winners. Please take a
look and improve them if you can, or add suggestions/drafts of more.

# Panton Papers
There are still Panton Papers being drafted which you can contribute
to or comment on, check out the links below for more!
Data Sharing Requirements
Text Mining

# Encouraging local open science groups and meet up
A new local groups page has been added to science.okfn.org. Building
local open science communities is a great way to meet people, generate
ideas, organise workshops and get things done so do think about
joining or starting one in your local area!

# Publishing Open Data Working Group
Iain Hrynaszkiewicz from BioMedCentral reported on the outcomes of
this BMC led workshop here and sent a call to the list for
collaboration here. If you are interested in the approach to open data
from the scientific publishers perspective then this should be of
considerable interest.

# Biosharing
Susanna Sansone recently introduced the Biosharing.org initiative to
the list. This community aims to create a catalogue of Biological data
standards and is in collaboration with publishers such as BMC to
include links to the site in their author instructions.

Iain pointed out that BMC is waiving publication fees for exemplar
data sets to encourage useful data sharing. BMC Research Notes has a
data sharing article collection edited by Dr Bill Hooker, Dr Heather
Piwowar and Dr David Shotton (who are all members or otherwise
associated with the working group).

More suggestions of standards for the catalogue and groups interested
in publishing datasets in BMC Research Notes are encouraged.

# Open Science/Open Data at Science Conferences
Iain Hrynaszkiewicz is keen to find out whether open science and open
data in science are presented at conferences that are not specifically
aimed at the open community. If you have seen it done, have entered a
proposal or know of any others who have then do start a conversation
on the list. It would be useful to compare experiences to find out how
best to approach this and get more exposure for the ideas of open
data/open science.

I like to request a mailing list and webpage as above. The third item
web page, and group page for participant profiles may overlap, in
which case perhaps the last one is better.

Please email me details on how I can populate the website, and how
people can subscribe to the mailing list; I'll route this to the
current Google Group then.

We have our next meeting September 1, and it would be great if these
things are set up by then.

Egon

Dear All,

The NECOBELAC Project is a network of collaboration between Europe and Latin American Caribbean countries. It began in 2009 and will run for three years, funded under the EU FP7 framework. The project works in the field of public health.

The main goals of NECOBELAC Project are to improve scientific writing, promote open access publication models and foster technical and scientific cooperation between Europe and Latin American Caribbean countries. 

According to these goals two levels of training sessions have been developed, T1 courses target to future trainers who will organize and deliver T2 courses at a local level, taking into account local needs.

The next T1 course will take place in the Universidad de Guadalajara (Mexico), August 22-24, 2011.

More information about the project can be found here: http://www.necobelac.eu/

Thanks to those who have taken a look, if anyone else who would like
to comment and change things could do so by Sunday evening, I'll
attempt to get the revised version in to PloS on Monday.

I added a number of comments. Does anyone have a suggestion for an
image that could accompany the piece? It would be particularly great
if there were a visualization of some PP-compatible dataset, e.g. from
CKAN.

I'm familiar with a few add-on workshops, birds-of-a-feature sessions, and
community forums set up adjacent to or within traditional conferences:

easily find the link.

I've also presented my research into open data availability as solo
presentations/posters at several traditional science and infosci
conferences, for what that is worth.

There have been lots of data sharing and data management activities over the
last decade in ecology and environmental science.  For example, we have
sponsored open data sharing and management workshops at the Ecological
Society of America annual conference since about 2000, held training
sessions for scientists on how to expose data in networks like the Knowledge
Network for Biocomplexity since about the same time, and held professional
development activities around exposing scientists at field stations and
early career faculty on principals of data sharing and tools for data
sharing.  As a rough estimate, our group of collaborators has probably held
30-40 workshop activities of this type aimed at science audiences since
roughly 2000.

Although I don't have links to all of these, here's a couple:

Inspired by Matt's post, I have the following submission --

I made a presentation titled "Policy Issues in Accessibility and Interoperability of Scientific Data: Experiences from the Carbon Modeling Field" (http://bit.ly/n3o5bT) at the last AGU Fall Meeting. The presentation was in a session titled "Institutional Support for Science and Scientists in an Age of Public Scrutiny" (http://www.agu.org/cgi-bin/sessions5?meeting=fm10&part=PA42B).

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEy0xWFoqgRFaUHc=7_e2ArSPSvLDD6VHOVN0hmJe7sotw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm giving a purely Open Data talk at the British Ecological Society
annual meeting next month actually...

http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/meetings/current_future_meetings/2011_annual_meeting/other_events.php#online

I've been invited for a little symposium entitled 'Publishing Science
in the online age'
It will hopefully be trackable on Twitter too, Sep 13th, using the
hashtag #BESdigital

here's a rough draft of my 10min talk so far...

Title: On the importance of 'Open Science' and 'Open Data'

Abstract: The Internet offers us an unprecedented opportunity to
disseminate research in all its forms, far and wide for ease of
accessibility, transparency, innovation, synthesis, education and
outreach. We could and *should* do more to take advantage of this
invaluable tool. One particular aspect that I campaign about, is the
digital and Open availability of research data. Arguably, in many cases
the underlying data is a more important and long-lasting contribution
than the research paper itself, yet it is common practice in scholarly
communications to only provide a paper with a mere description of the
data and analysis. We have the tools to move beyond this bare minimum,
and journals are slowly adopting them, but not nearly as much as they
should. So with this talk, I shall state the case for 'Open Data'
principles, with real examples of why accessibility and transparency is
vitally important for maximally efficient research, and how it can
benefit us all.


Needless to say I haven't done the slides yet.
I was thinking of reppin' Panton Principles, the OKF, Dryad, Figshare,
"It's The Data" [1]
"Linking Big" [2], DataCite (and the principles of data citation), and
current issues with citations e.g.
"Fame, Glory & Neglect in Meta-Analyses" [3,4,5]

That's probably a bit ambitious for 10mins but we'll see how it goes.
Suggestions for additions and/or ecology-specific additions are
welcome!
I notice the 5 BES run journals are 'Dryad partners' but between them
have only submitted 1 dataset from 2009(!) to the Dryad repo! Perhaps
some influence could help persuade BES to become *active* Dryad
partners?


Finally, to provide some further comment on the general issue of
presenting on Open Data at Science conferences...

I'd love to do Open Data / Open Science advocacy talks at every
Science meeting I go to - a lot people just aren't aware of the issues
and I feel these talks could potentially be very valuable to change
and influence mindsets.
BUT I feel I can't for a couple of reasons. 1.) Is the classic "I
don't have the time/energy". For some conferences, I'd feel very lucky
if I even got one talk accepted (my main research stuff). To ask for
two separate talks would be almost unthinkable, and I kinda have to
put my research first atm (but I can sneak in a few advocacy slides at
the end of my talk if the conference isn't too serious, as I did at
ProgPal 2011: http://www.slideshare.net/rossmounce/progpal2011)

that reason probably isn't that novel or unexpected... but the next
might be a bit more interesting
2.) In my experience, if you DO give a serious, well-researched,
quantitated, subject-tailored, Open Data advocacy talk - people don't
view it as research; they see it as pure politics and it rules you
ineligible for talk prizes!
I'm particularly thinking of my Young Systematists' Forum Dec 1st 2010
talk: http://prezi.com/1s0lkatmc30t/the-continued-growth-of-phylogenetic-information/
The judges really liked it, thought it was a great talk, but it was
'unscorable' in their words. Having to stick to the set criteria on
their marking schemes, I apparently disqualified myself from the
student's competition!
The gist of it is; I have a horrible feeling that *some* people view
anything even mildly political as NOT Scientific, even if it's hugely
evidenced-based, and this is a significant problem to overcome.


Regards,

Ross

Dear all,

Thanks for sending your examples of *non*-open science conferences where
you have presented/submitted proposals to about open science.

I have a few to add from this year:
1. MedicReS International Conference on Good Medical Research, Istanbul,
26th March 2011. http://www.ic2011.medicres.com/?islem=1&list=23
'Preparing Raw Clinical Data for Publication: Guidance for Journal
Editors, Authors, and Peer Reviewers' (around 150 medical researchers
and clinicians)
2. Society for Clinical Trials, Vancouver, 17th May 2011. 'New Insights
in Reporting Clinical Trials: From Protocol to Systematic Review and
Beyond' (The last section of this 90-minute session was a detailed
discussion about sharing clinical research data; about 40 attendees)

Upcoming:
CONSORT 2011 meeting (http://www.consort-statement.org/), 7-9th
September, Quebec. I'll be making the case for how the CONSORT Statement
can be enhanced to better encourage/require access to raw data
Some others for 2011-12 TBC.

What do we think about, and what options do we have for,
tracking/collating open science session activities  at field-specific
conferences by this group? It might help us identify areas requiring
further advocacy or ambassadors..?

Best regards,

Iain

I'm giving a purely Open Data talk at the British Ecological Society
annual meeting next month actually...

http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/meetings/current_future_meetings
/2011_annual_meeting/other_events.php#online

I've been invited for a little symposium entitled 'Publishing Science in
the online age'
It will hopefully be trackable on Twitter too, Sep 13th, using the
hashtag #BESdigital

here's a rough draft of my 10min talk so far...

Title: On the importance of 'Open Science' and 'Open Data'

Abstract: The Internet offers us an unprecedented opportunity to
disseminate research in all its forms, far and wide for ease of
accessibility, transparency, innovation, synthesis, education and
outreach. We could and *should* do more to take advantage of this
invaluable tool. One particular aspect that I campaign about, is the
digital and Open availability of research data. Arguably, in many cases
the underlying data is a more important and long-lasting contribution
than the research paper itself, yet it is common practice in scholarly
communications to only provide a paper with a mere description of the
data and analysis. We have the tools to move beyond this bare minimum,
and journals are slowly adopting them, but not nearly as much as they
should. So with this talk, I shall state the case for 'Open Data'
principles, with real examples of why accessibility and transparency is
vitally important for maximally efficient research, and how it can
benefit us all.


Needless to say I haven't done the slides yet.
I was thinking of reppin' Panton Principles, the OKF, Dryad, Figshare,
"It's The Data" [1] "Linking Big" [2], DataCite (and the principles of
data citation), and current issues with citations e.g.
"Fame, Glory & Neglect in Meta-Analyses" [3,4,5]

That's probably a bit ambitious for 10mins but we'll see how it goes.
Suggestions for additions and/or ecology-specific additions are welcome!
I notice the 5 BES run journals are 'Dryad partners' but between them
have only submitted 1 dataset from 2009(!) to the Dryad repo! Perhaps
some influence could help persuade BES to become *active* Dryad
partners?


Finally, to provide some further comment on the general issue of
presenting on Open Data at Science conferences...

I'd love to do Open Data / Open Science advocacy talks at every Science
meeting I go to - a lot people just aren't aware of the issues and I
feel these talks could potentially be very valuable to change and
influence mindsets.
BUT I feel I can't for a couple of reasons. 1.) Is the classic "I don't
have the time/energy". For some conferences, I'd feel very lucky if I
even got one talk accepted (my main research stuff). To ask for two
separate talks would be almost unthinkable, and I kinda have to put my
research first atm (but I can sneak in a few advocacy slides at the end
of my talk if the conference isn't too serious, as I did at ProgPal
2011: http://www.slideshare.net/rossmounce/progpal2011)

that reason probably isn't that novel or unexpected... but the next
might be a bit more interesting
2.) In my experience, if you DO give a serious, well-researched,
quantitated, subject-tailored, Open Data advocacy talk - people don't
view it as research; they see it as pure politics and it rules you
ineligible for talk prizes!
I'm particularly thinking of my Young Systematists' Forum Dec 1st 2010
talk:
http://prezi.com/1s0lkatmc30t/the-continued-growth-of-phylogenetic-infor
mation/
The judges really liked it, thought it was a great talk, but it was
'unscorable' in their words. Having to stick to the set criteria on
their marking schemes, I apparently disqualified myself from the
student's competition!
The gist of it is; I have a horrible feeling that *some* people view
anything even mildly political as NOT Scientific, even if it's hugely
evidenced-based, and this is a significant problem to overcome.


Regards,

Ross

Hi All

I've made quite a few changes to the PLoS Biology 'Community Page' on
the working group, this is the final draft and I hope to send it in
the next couple of days so now is your chance if you have any last
minute comments or suggestions!

Hi All

Does anyone have any ideas for a career oriented open data session
under the theme of:
?        The 21st Century Researcher
These sessions have been very well attended at the ESOFs I've been to,
and are a good opportunity to engage with a broad spectrum of early
career researchers.

Dear ESOF2012 Future Participant,

In less than a year?s time Dublin will host ESOF2012, Europe?s largest
general science conference.
ESOF2012 will bring together over 5,000 international researchers,
policy-makers and media to discuss major global challenges such as
ageing, food security and climate change.

A key aspect of ESOF2012 will be the Careers Programme, which will
showcase the spectrum of career opportunities available for
researchers at all stages of their career under the three broad themes
of:
???????? The 21st Century Researcher;
???????? The Global Researcher;
???????? The Diversity of Careers for Researchers

The programme will address some of the major issues facing researchers
in Europe, as well as providing a platform for employers to outline
the key tools needed by researchers.

The call for proposals is now open and we welcome innovative and
interactive session proposals targeting researchers with backgrounds
in all fields of research.

To submit a proposal, please follow the link to
www.dublinscience2012.ie/calls. Criteria for proposals are available

Hi All

Another request re: the PLoS profile - does anybody know of a nice
visualisation either of or made using open science data? It would be
good to have an illustration to break up the text.
Thanks a lot!

There was this timemap of papers from IuCR done by Ben O'Steen as part
of the JISC OpenBib project:

<http://benosteen.com/timemap/index>

Ben also did this pretty cool visualization of the medline data (also
done as part of JISC OpenBib project). See the final product post for
details:

<http://openbiblio.net/2011/06/30/final-product-post-open-bibliography/>

Demo video:

<http://vimeo.com/benosteen/medline>

Interactive version (needs good browser and right graphics card!):

The other simple thing is to use a wordle (such as those use for the WG site)

Jenny, this is a great idea. I wonder if one or two of the big data services
such as EBI might be encouraged to help organise a session on data curation
as a career option? It offers lots of job opportunities and already there is
scope for advancement, and must surely only grow in the future. It's also
becoming very professionalised, with an association and (I believe) a
journal too, now.

Hi Alma,
actually there is already a society promoting the field of biocuration, see:
http://www.biocurator.org/
I collaborate closely with the current President, if you wish me to put 
you in contact with her.

Subject: [open-science] Open Crystallography
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Pjges0FDYjSKyj78mmuFCN+J2nOSQYr0ZcXQ-tHbShqQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have proposed that there should be an Open Crystallography activity (see
me post and previous ones)
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/08/30/open-crystallography-the-hargreaves-report-can-help-make-ccdc-data-open/.
I think there is a real chance that we can persuade the International
Union of Crystallography to adopt an Open philosophy on crystallograph. In
my blog (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/08/28/iucr2011-open-crystallography/ ) I
simply took Panton and changed "science" to "crystallography". In my talk
yesterday I proposed

"All published crystallographic data should be Open"

I would be moderately confident of getting the last sentence adopted. I know
the Union and president, so if we make a careful case I think it would be
well received. This could then act as a template for other scientific
bodies.

P.

Are we preparing a response to the (UK) Hargreaves report [that copyright
should not apply to text- and data-mining in science]? Time is short but I
think it would be very valuable. I have been active in both areas and have
run up against gatekeepers.

I posted this to okfn-discuss as well (it's more general than science). I
have commented on the Guardian blog site and have been blogging on the topic
for about a month.

There is definite scope for open-science - I think data can be added to the
equation.
