Nice to see such a strong emphasis on openness and reusability. :-)

---------- Forwarded message ----------

*Open Repositories 2013 - Reminder: Deadline for proposals is Monday, March
4!
*

This year?s Open Repositories conference takes place in Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island, Canada between Monday, July 8 and Friday, July
12. Registration is now open at http://or2013.net
<http://or2013.net%2C/> - register
early and reserve your
accommodation<http://or2013.net/content/loc/accommodations> as
soon as you can! An outline of the conference schedule is now available on
the conference website at http://or2013.net/program/session-schedule

We invite you to contribute to the conference program. The final deadline
for proposals is *Monday, March 4*.

This year?s conference theme is *Use, Reuse, Reproduce*. One of the most
important roles of repositories is to enable greater use and reuse of their
contents? whether those contents are library collections, scholarly
articles, research data, or software?and metadata. The notion of use and
reuse can be extended to repository infrastructure as well. Many
repositories are based on open source software that can be freely reused
and adapted to serve local needs; other efforts are also emerging both in
conjunction with and outside traditional repository platforms to encourage
discipline or community specific reuse and sharing of software, services,
and infrastructure. In addition there is a growing interest and need to
document and share the code and workflows used to produce research results
- particularly in computationally intensive fields - in order to promote
reproducible research. We are very pleased to announce that the opening
keynote this year will be Victoria Stodden of Columbia University and
co-founder of http://www.runmycode.org/<http://www.runmycode.org/CompanionSite/home.do>.
See more about Dr. Stodden here: http://www.stodden.net/

Some specific areas of interest for OR2013 are:

   - Effective re-use of content--particularly research data--enabled by
   embedded repository tools and services
   - Effective re-use of software, services, and infrastructure to support
   repository development
   - Facilitation of reproducible research through access to data,
   workflows, and code
   - Services making use of repository metadata
   - Focused, disciplinary or community-based software, services, and
   infrastructure for use and reuse of content
   - Integration of data, including linked data, and external services with
   repositories to provide solutions to specific domains
   - Added-value services for repositories
   - Long-term preservation of repositories and their contents
   - Role and impact of repositories in the research ecosystem

 The aim of the Open Repositories Conference is to bring those responsible
for the development, implementation and management of digital repositories
together with stakeholders, such as researchers, librarians, publishers and
others, to address theoretical, practical, and strategic issues across the
entire lifecycle of information, from the creation and management of
digital content, to enabling use, re-use, and interconnection of
information, and ensuring long-term preservation and archiving. The current
economic climate dictates that repositories operate across administrative
and disciplinary boundaries and to interact with distributed computational
services and social communities.

Submissions can take the form of proposals for presentations, panels,
posters, demonstrations, and workshops. We will consider any submission
that seems to us sufficiently original and repository-related to merit
attention at this event, but we?ll give preference to submissions that
address our primary theme. In some cases, papers submitted to the general
conference may be referred to user groups if appropriate.

*Key dates and contacts*

   - EXTENDED to 4 March 2013: Deadline for submissions
   - 12 April 2013: Submitters notified of acceptance to general conference
   - 19 April 2013: Submitters notified of acceptance to user groups
   - 8-12 July 2013: OR2013 conference:
      - 8 July 2013: Pre-conference workshops
      - 9-11 July 2013: General Conference
      - 11-12 July 2013: DSpace, EPrints, and Fedora user group meetings

 *Submission process*
*Conference Papers and Panels*
We welcome two- to four-page proposals for presentations or panels that
deal with organizational, theoretical, practical, or administrative issues
of digital repositories and repository services that are not specific to a
particular technical platform. Abstracts of accepted papers will be made
available through the conference?s web site, and later they and associated
materials will be made available in a repository intended for current and
future OR content. In general, sessions are an hour and a half long with
three papers per session; panels may take an entire session. Relevant
papers unsuccessful in the main track will automatically be considered for
inclusion, as appropriate, as a User Group presentation.

*User Group Presentations*
One to two-page proposals for presentations or panels that focus on use of
one of the major repository platforms (EPrints, DSpace and Fedora) are
invited from developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators
and practitioners describing novel experiences or developments in the
construction and use of repositories involving issues specific to these
technical platforms.

*24x7 Presentation Proposals*
We welcome one- to two-page proposals for 7 minute presentations comprising
no more than 24 slides. Similar to Pecha Kuchas or Lightning Talks, these
24x7 presentations will be grouped into blocks based on conference themes,
with each block followed by a moderated discussion / question and answer
session involving the audience and whole block of presenters. This forum
will provide conference goers with a fast-paced survey of like work across
many institutions, and presenters the chance to disseminate their work in
more depth and context than a traditional poster.

*Posters and Demos*
We invite developers, researchers, repository managers, administrators and
practitioners to submit one-page proposals for posters and demonstrations.
Posters provide an opportunity to present work that isn?t appropriate for a
paper; you?ll have the chance to do a 60-second pitch for your poster or
demo during a plenary session at the conference.

*Workshops and Tutorials*
One- to two-page proposals for Workshops and Tutorials addressing
theoretical or practical issues around digital repositories are welcomed.
Workshops and tutorials will take place on the Monday before the
conference. Please address the following in your proposal:

   - The subject of the event and what knowledge you intend to convey
   - Length of session (e.g., 1-hour, 2-hour? half a day? whole day?)
   - How many attendees you plan to accommodate
   - Technology and facility requirements
   - Any other supplies or support required
   - A brief statement on the learning outcomes from the session
   - Anything else you believe is pertinent to carrying out the session

 Developer Challenge
Each year a significant proportion of the delegates at Open Repositories
are software developers who work on repository software or related
services, and once again OR2013 will feature a Developer Challenge. An
announcement will be made in the future with more details on the Challenge.
Developers are also encouraged to make submissions to the other
tracks--including posters, demonstrations, and 24x7 presentations--to
present on recently completed work and works-in-progress.

If you have any requests that fall outside of the call, such as satellite
meetings, please contact the local conference chair, Mark Leggott,
University of Prince Edward Island, at mleggott at upei.ca.

PLEASE submit your paper, poster, demo or workshop proposal through the
conference system. PDF format is preferred. Please include presentation
title, authors? names and affiliations in the submission. The conference
system is linked from the conference web site (http://or2013.net/).


*Program Co-Chairs:*
Jon W. Dunn, Indiana University Bloomington, jwd at iu.edu
Sarah L. Shreeves, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,

Thanks for sharing these links Heather.  Plenty of food for thought.
The comment from Tracey Lauriault on Ted's post is as interesting as
the post itself as is her link to

Best Practices for Sharing Sensitive Environmental Geospatial Data
ftp://ftp2.cits.rncan.gc.ca/pub/geott/ess_pubs/288/288863/cgdi_ip_15_e.pdf

One can imagine the emergence of more domain-specific good practices
for data sharing although some of the domain-specific issues may be
generalisable back to an expanded set of open data principles.

Cheers... Steve

Subject: [open-science] Attribution,
	Rights and Licensing of names and compilations of names
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEwHpj-hQ5fZvW-fkcb78xU5e3WWvXbau2PHhbbwsLvaVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

GlobalNames.org is running a workshop in mid-April in Arizona to assess
the Attribution, Rights and Licensing of names and compilations of names.
At the moment this area is regrettably fuzzy and this causes real issues in
scientific research:

some taxonomic organisations do NOT provide open data e.g.

http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/info/copyright

http://www.theplantlist.org/terms/

http://www.organismnames.com/terms.htm

whilst others are open e.g.
http://www.canadensys.net/2012/why-we-should-publish-our-data-under-cc0

further details and discussion here on the TAXACOM mailing list:
http://markmail.org/thread/piqil5tsjntvzne7#query:+page:1+mid:piqil5tsjntvzne7+state:results

The aim of the workshop is a report that clarifies if and how we share
[organism] names.

We seek submissions from all interested parties - nomenclaturalists,
taxonomists, aggregators, and users of names. Let us know what (you think)
intellectual property rights apply or what rights should be associated with
names and compilations of names. How can those who compile names get useful
attribution for names, and what responsibilities do they have to ensure
that information is authoritative. If there are rights, what kind of
licensing is appropriate.

The submissions will be considered by those attending the workshop.


Contributions can be submitted
http://names-attribution-rights-and-licensing.wikia.com/wiki/Main_Page,
where you will find more information about this event.

Thankyou

David Patterson globalnames.org I would certainly be interested in hearing
from anyone that has found this uncertainty wrt Attribution, Rights and
Licensing of organism names as an impediment to research. The Open
Knowledge Foundation may well contribute a submission for this workshop.

Dear lists,

The Open Knowledge Foundation is organising a special Crowdcrafting Hackday
at the Centre for Creative Collaboration in London on Saturday 16th March
from 10:00 to 17:00 (GMT) in collaboration with the Citizen Cyberscience
Center and Citizen Cyberlab.

The overall aim will be to develop micro-tasking apps for Science &
Humanities applications. We will have several experts there on the day
representing http://www.epicollect.net/ (Imperial College London) as well
as the lead developer of Crowdcrafting.org himself - Daniel Lombra?a
Gonz?lez (Citizen Cyberscience Center). An opportunity not to be missed!

Participants are welcome to either join-in with a project development on
the day, or bring their own app idea/proposal (but if the latter please do
get in contact with us beforehand so we can better accommodate this).

More info here: http://okfn.org/events/science-hackday-march-2013/

Event sign-up (required) here:

Wonderful - thanks Ross.

I would be optimistic (with no hard evidence!) that we will see a shift
towards Open. This has happened with GLAM (e.g. Libraries and Museums) and
it may be valuable for use to prepare arguments and examples of Openness.

In our own project I assume we can use these resources privately as
checklists even if we don't publish the lists and make our own
semi-definitive list of species-in-the-literature. Of course I am aware of
all sorts of error, ambiguity, etc.

At 3pm EST, Thursday, March 7, Science magazine will be running a live
video chat called Should Scientific Papers Be Free?, tackling the
question of open access publishing. What does the U.S.?s new policy
making federally funded research freely accessible mean for scientists
and journals? Could it improve scientific research? And does it go far
enough?

Our own Jocelyn Kaiser will be moderating the discussion, and our guests
will be Heather Joseph, who advocates for open access as the executive
director of the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition,
and Fredrick Dylla, who has criticized the concept as executive
director of the American Institute of Physics.

Dear Peter

 

This is not about "notes in the pocket" but about creating a reference name server for all the existing names including links to their original citation. Names play the integration function in Biology and they are semilegal ruled by Codes. We thus cannot have somewhere on our computer a little cache where we have the few names we are interested in but need to have an open infrastructure.

Currently there are ca 1.9M species described, but no catalogue exists. The situation is furthermore marred by the fact that there are synonyms of various kinds, misidentication and thus tons of name usages. A chaos at best.

 

The good thing though is that we have movements to clean this up. On the one hand we have increasing large silos of names, like GNA; we have a Biodiversity Heritage Library that finds names in albeit often badly OCRed text, often in not very useful way, but that can change with better tools; we have initiatives to make names more useful, like Zoobank; we have registration of new names in Mycology (fungi), or electronic published zoological names. And we have an advanced publisher, that produces semantically enhanced linked  publications (eg Zookeys).

 

There are also some initiatives now on the way, some EU and NSF funded, to work towards this large ambitious goal. 

 

A decisive factor will be how much of the published record will become open access (ca 2,000 journals or books per year create fully or partially taxonomic content) and thus add to the growing body of open access text.

 

There is also a confusion of what is copyright (protection of a work) and what is protection for a lot of work (I worked on this all my life, why should somebody else have free access) or scientific advantage of having a compilation of names. Finally there is also the issue of database protection in the EU, though I think most don't understand this either.

 

For that reason it is important to show on the one hand the advantage of having access to this reference system and integrate it into the scientific publishing process. At the same time, it is worthwhile from time to time to remind that a discussion on copyright is better run by specialists, similar to have taxonomists make taxonomic decisions.

 

Cheers

Donat

Great idea and important direction ~

Some thoughts on approach: it might be most helpful to provide explanation and illustration of what can be achieved through an open approach along with information and education about how to achieve this. Note that while open licensing is necessary, to be useful requires development using open standards and formats as well. 

If people are concerned (sometimes rightly) about funding, what might be most helpful for them to move forward is assistance in making the case for openness. While there are a few publishers in scholarship that are prioritizing profit over service, there are also many not-for-profits that just haven't figured out how to make open happen. For some, the expanded value that they could offer by moving to open could be key to ensuring their long-term survival.

My two bits ~

Heather Morrison

there are no datasets publicly available that I'm aware of, but perhaps it
would be useful to contact the authors of this paper

Hi Dina,

it seems that most of websites with recipes have some kind of rating system, see e.g. (the first Google find):
http://allrecipes.com/
You just need to scrap it (or ask them). 

As a side note, http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.6074 (not ranking, but analysis of recipes for ingredients).

Regards,
Piotr

Dear all,
Is there a reference document which describes and breaks down (e.g.
subscriptions) the scientific information budgets worldwide and
country per country?
Thanks in advance,
Laurent

Subject: [open-science] New Crowdcrafting App - crowdsourcing OA journal
	licence & copyright data
Message-ID: <CAJr+OExcVgiUMgZUs_Jwd65VG1-K4BBnoGjsbqFr9UkJPrK2XA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just released a demo of a new app on Crowdcrafting.org that Daniel
Lombrana Gonzalez has helped me create.

It's called *Is It an Open Access Journal?* and can be found here:
http://crowdcrafting.org/app/oajournals/

It's part of an ongoing project to assess what licence e.g. CC BY that Open
Access journals are publishing their articles under, and also who retains
the copyright of the articles e.g. the Author(s), the Journal, or the
Society.

The source code for the app is here on github:
https://github.com/PyBossa/app-oajournals
so suggestions for improvements & additions are welcome and should be
directed there.

Should you be interested in creating a similar app to crowdsource data on
something else, do give Crowdcrafting.org a look - it's completely free to
use and fairly easy to get an app up and running :)


Ross

PS I know DOAJ lists licences but I believe some of that data might be old,
thus we need to independently reassess this to keep it accurate and
up-to-date.

A couple of interesting recent finds on privacy:

Private traits and attributes are predictable from digital records of
human behavior
http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2013/03/06/1218772110.full.pdf
- an analysis of Facebook "likes" is a reasonably good predictor of
sexual orientation, race, political orientation, and even "openness".
You can try it out yourself at http://www.youarewhatyoulike.com/

The Return of Results in Genetic Testing: Who Owes What to Whom, When, and Why?
http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2227667
- on the obligation to inform versus the the wish to know and the
complexity that ensues

Subject: [open-science] Conference to Eliminate Health Disparities in
	Genomic Medicine
Message-ID: <CAN-Qvoe0f_PizQTSnaF0dQ8Op9TQvX6rG0VnBhuHvucKiq2RMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone;

I would like to know if anyone involved in open science (from the members
of this mailing list)  will attend to the "Why We Can?t Wait: Conference to
Eliminate Health Disparities in Genomic Medicine" to take place in San
Francisco, CA at the end of May.

I am planning to go and perhaps to submit something of my own work. I know
that there are lots of things going on in the Bay Area regarding open
science, so basically, I would probably decide whether I should go or not
depending on the chances of meeting someone working on open science and
biomedicine.

It might sound silly to ask this but since I am in Mexico City I need to
get the best of limited resources.

Thanks in advance and Cheers!!!

Mario

	Manchester UK - anyone keen?
Message-ID: <CABPM+wq2mFz77dWswhRipRzktC+Pe9Zuzv-8v3BoyeTtEF_78Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All


Students from the University of Manchester, and other students from
Manchester and the University of Lancaster are organising a graduate
conference on nanotechnology at the Cranage Hall in Cheshire from 17th-20th
June 2013.


The NoWNANO Summer Conference is wholly student-organised within the
academic framework of the NoWNANO Doctoral Training Centre (DTC) and aims
to provide an exciting and informative experience for all of those involved
in the DTC programme.  It will include speakers from industry, senior
academics and graduate students.  You can find out more information about
the conference here:  www.nanoconf.co.uk and find out about past
conferences here:
nownano.manchester.ac.uk/news-conferencesandseminars.html<http://www.nownano.manchester.ac.uk/news-conferencesandseminars.html>


They will be holding a panel discussion on open science on the Wednesday
(19th June) and are very keen to include somebody from the Open Knowledge
Foundation in a panel discussion on the topic, they would be interested in
hearing from a researcher who could talk about open access to scientific
publications, the impact of patenting in science, or any other important
topics that may be of interest to their graduates.


Would anyone be keen to take part? Travel expenses and accommodation will
be paid for. Let me know!


Best wishes


Jenny

Subject: [open-science] Challenge launched to promote open data for education
Message-ID: <CAN+1nMwZm+FryQZhgk6kMZu-kZubEb-RbUY=YLkunrP3N4UKZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear open science and open access lists,

We are launching a challenge today to promote the use of linked of
open data in education (the full announcement is copied below). I'm
hoping this is of interest to people on this list, as we are
specifically interested in innovative applications that can be used
for education in a university context. Please help spread the word and
let us know if you have any thoughts or ideas!


The LinkedUp project is very pleased to announce the launch of the
LinkedUp challenge [1]. This is a series of three competitions (Veni,
Vidi, and Vici) promoting the innovative use of linked and open data
in an educational context.

The LinkedUp team invites anyone, from researchers and students, to
developers and businesses, to join the first 'Veni' competition [2].
You can participate by building prototypes, demos and innovative tools
that exploit, use, integrate or analyse large scale web data for
educational use.

Some very attractive prizes are only one reason to join and
participate [3] in the challenge. It is also a great opportunity to
work with a large, documented repository of linked datasets [4] that
the LinkedUp team is putting together. The consortium is also able to
offer dedicated access to so far non-public resources. The challenge
allows participants to showcase their ideas and solutions to a wide
community of researchers and practitioners. For businesses as well as
researchers, this will be a great opportunity to present their company
and enhance their network. For people working in academia, the
challenge will provide a wealth of material and opportunities for
experiments and publications.

While the LinkedUp team already identified and connected many
educational and non-educational resources to work with, participants
can also use and connect their own material or other data sources.
Anyone is free to showcase their creativity and solutions as long as
the application is relevant to education in the broadest sense of the
word. There are also some high profile use cases of established
organisations made available [5] that can serve as inspiration for
innovative applications. Join today!

Dear all,

As I join this mailing list, I thought I have to introduce myself.
My name is Vincent Adam, I'm a french student now based in London where I
started a phd in computational neuroscience at the Gatsby unit in UCL.
I am very interested in all the changes that appeared in the practice of
science in the last years (new ways to share software, to share data, to
get funding, to publish, to communicate, to involve citizens in research
etc...). I'm following all these changes and would like to find a way to
contribute.

In the last year, I ve been working with friends and collaborators to
develop some open tools to do behavioral experiments in cognitive science
on smartphones, and on a project to actually use them for research.
two links of projects both being built if you are interested. But I really
lack time these days, and I'm looking for help and funds
https://code.google.com/p/behavioral-experiments-android/
http://vincentadam87.synology.me/daydreaming/wordpress/

Otherwise, I've been following the work of a group in Paris called
HackyourPhd (https://hackyourphd.wordpress.com/about-2/)
whose aim can be summarized as acting to change the phd experience through
the opening of science.
I'd be happy to discuss those ideas here in london.
There seems to be a community of same interests in london I would be happy
to join.

Hope to meet you soon

Vincent

Hi Vincent

Welcome to the open science list!

Those look like really great projects, if you want help with development
you might be interested in our citizen science hackdays, the first one was
in London last weekend where we were building smartphone apps using
http://www.epicollect.net/ and linking them to the crowdsourcing platform
http://crowdcrafting.org/.
See Ross' blog post here:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/03/17/crowdsourcing-success-science-hack-day-london/

There will be more to come so watch this space! If you want technical help
in the meantime, you could try our open-science-dev list
http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-science-dev

I don't know of anything similar to HackyourPhD in London, but maybe
someone else on the list can chip in. I run a monthly(ish) discussion group
on open science in Oxford and you'd be more than welcome to come along to
that, the programme will be released shortly. I have a couple of spare
slots, maybe we could team up and run a similar style of meeting?

In fact I'd be really interested to hear more from anyone on the list
associated with HackyourPhD, we love to advertise open science initiatives
so if anyone would be willing to write a short blog post on the group for
the science.okfn.org/blog, that would be great!

Apologies for cross posting****

*************

*Joint OpenAIRE/LIBER Workshop : ?Dealing with Data: What?s the Role for
the Library?. 28 May, Gent, Belgium* Registration now open. This is a
pre-ELAG workshop.**

In the same week that the Research Data Alliance Plenary identified that
skill-sets for research data management are in short supply, it seems
timely to announce a workshop to explore where the library and research
institution sit in relation to supporting research data management, and
what future expectations for libraries might be.****

The library and research institution are having to understand their role
within this changing environment, and define the necessary support
mechanisms. OpenAIRE supports a range of stakeholders, namely librarians
and researchers in depositing, searching as well as linking research
output. LIBER supports libraries in making the transformation and acquiring
an active role in evolving areas such as research data management and
scientific information infrastructures.****

Expert speakers will cover issues such as the data life-cycle, data
citation, data publication, tools, and how research institutions can
support their researchers in data management. In addition, a number of
scientists will present their views on how  they  use, share, and link
research data within different domains. The day will close with a panel
session, supported by members of the LIBER Steering Committee ?Scholarly
Communication and Research Infrastructure? which will explore future
skill-sets for librarians.****

Dear all,

Just to briefly introduce myself - Dimitar Poposki aka @poposkidimitar
#OpenAccessMKD #OER_MKD on Twitter or just go to
http://www.vizualize.me/DimitarPoposkiCV#

US Department of State Alumni in 2004/2005 - Rutgers - visiting scholar
exploring the topics of digital libraries. Lived in USA for 1 year, 1 month
in France, Austria, Germany...Traveled all of SEEurope mainly by bus...
Mendeley and Figshare advisor for Macedonia...12 years of experience in
academic libraries and digitization (A-Z).

Currently I am writing my doctoral dissertation that deals with Open Access
and Open Educational Resources and it's implementation into the higher
education in Republic of Macedonia. Searching for a PhD research grant for
open policies for last 2 years - no success so far. My topics of interest
also include open data, open access scientific publishing, e-journals,
scientific repositories and digitization of intangible cultural heritage.
Attached is my Resume and CV that I did just recently emphasizing
professional interests.

The main reason for joining the list is the frustration that I deal with as
a PhD researcher from Macedonia and the non-existing access to resources
(basically, EBSCO is the ONLY database that I have access 2). I have
organized OA week events in my country since 2010 and speak about open
data/open science promoting the importance of FOSS(More info on
http://www.netvibes.com/poposkidimitar#Open_Access_Advocacy including
posters and livestream from the events ). The situation is bad, but I'm not
giving up...I needed 2 years to convince the academia to use OJS platform
and now I'm trying to teach them what is (not how to use, but explain the
basics of) Creative Commons...

How can I help? Social networking, strong information management skills,
advocacy for open data and strong motivation to get a new job that will
promote openness of academic resources. Different viewpoint on information
infrastructure, information management - organizational skills, design
skills, conference organization...I have done a lot of things - usually on
a personal basis with tight deadlines and immense pressure (do not
recommend the higher education surrounding in Macedonia as a place to work
to anyone)

I am more than aware that people from developing countries don't get a lot

Is anyone in touch with or involved with the Research Data Alliance? It
would be wonderful if there could be an open data working group, and a
stronger focus on open data (and the Panton Principles) more generally!

Jonathan --

At DataONE, we've been involved in the talks leading to the formation of
the Research Data Alliance, as have many of the other DataNet partners in
the US.  DataONE and these other partners all have a commitment to open
data, and I fully expect that it would be a major emphasis of RDA. I think
it is implicit in almost all of the activities I have seen to date.
 Certainly most of the the working group activities have moved beyond
simply stating that data should be open, and instead focus on how one gets
there via metadata interoperability, long-term preservation, etc. (see
http://rd-alliance.org/working-groups/current-candidate-groups/). Are you
thinking there is some explicit risk that RDA will try to be non-open, or
are you just trying to raise the profile of open data within the RDA
activities? Thanks for the clarification...

Hi Matt,

This is great to know. While the emphasis on open data may be implicit and
evident to partners, it is not so evident on the current website! So happy
to hear that there is broad support. :-)

To be a bit more specific, it is not clear that the 'sharing' and 'reuse'
that are described on the RDA website extend to the public, as opposed to
sharing between institutions or researchers. Also it is not clear that
there is a principled commitment to openness (as in the OpenDefinition.org)
and removing restrictions on reuse (as per the Panton Principles), as
opposed to - for example - the more typical terms and conditions for
research data distribution services which often permit private use, but
which may limit redistribution and further downstream sharing.

Typically the reuse rights for aggregators are only as permissive as
upstream providers (researchers, institutions, etc) allow, so while there
may be a commitment to open data from the RDA, this would have to be
accompanied by serious commitments from funders, research bodies, national
agencies, etc. Given that the rights clearance, evangelism, standards
building and best practises work involved in explicitly opening up the
world's research data is a non-trivial, I'd expect open data to be a core
focus of at least one of the working groups. Perhaps it already is?

In any case - great to hear that there is core support for open data, and I
look forward to hearing more about RDA plans on this front.

All the best,

Jonathan

Thank Natalia. Has there been explicit discussion of open data (e.g. via
CC0 or other public domain legal tools, as per the Panton Principles) as
part of the legal interoperability discussion?

Hi Jonathan --

Those are great points, and I agree that an open data working group would
be a fantastic addition to RDA, for exactly the reasons that you raise.  Of
course, as was evident on this list a few weeks ago, there are some
legitimate reasons why some research data are not open, such as human
subjects data with the privacy of personal information is at stake (e.g.,
medical records).  I think it would be great if the RDA were strongly
supporting open data while clarifying which types of data might qualify for
exceptions -- global agreement on these classifications would allow major
gains by clarifying that we expect the vast majority of data to be open
data.

Matt

Yes, I just attended the plenary in G?teborg, esp the WG on Legal Interoperability of Research Data. We haven't yet gotten to discussing the specifics of licensing mechanisms, but I reckon it will happen at some point.

This has implications for open data licenses in Canada. It makes no sense to have a license to waive the copyright in data when no such copyright exists.

Exactly Matt. There are indeed legitimate exceptions (like privacy). But it
would be wonderful to see a stronger, more explicit 'open by default'
approach from the RDA (as per the Panton Principles. Would you or others be
in a position to propose this - either as a new WG, or as an additional
focus area for an existing one?

I haven't been attending these meetings myself, but I'll cc Bill Michener
Rebecca Koskela who have been representing our DataONE project at RDA and
see how they think it might be best to proceed.  Looking at the proposed
charter for the RDA legal working group, I do see that Bill is a proposed
member from DataONE, and that there is a slot for an as yet unnamed OKFN
representative.  To view the proposed WG charter, see the attachment here:
http://forum.rd-alliance.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=32#p199.  Seems to me like
this legal group is in a good position to address the open data issues you
are interested in, and that maybe extending the proposed WG charter is
still feasible -- it is still being actively discussed, as evidenced by
Mark Parsons commentary on it as of February 28th.

Since I attended the meeting for this group u thought I'd chip in my 2 cent. It's my understanding that the legal interoperability group has been turned in to an interest group because the remit was too broad. Not once was open data mentioned in the group meeting. From my perspective an open  data WG would be an excellent addition     under the umbrella of this interest group.
Depending in the type of deliverable you foresee, the engagement WG might also be a good place to devise ways to encourage disciplines etc to engage with open data principles.

Best,

Susan Reilly

Of course, as was evident on this list a few weeks ago, there are some legitimate reasons why some research data are not open, such as human subjects data with the privacy of personal information is at stake (e.g., medical records).  I think it would be great if the RDA were strongly supporting open data while clarifying which types of data might qualify for exceptions -- global agreement on these classifications would allow major gains by clarifying that we expect the vast majority of data to be open data.

Is it restricted to the data provided via LinkedUp, or will any Open
Data do? In particular, we're using WikiPathways data extensively in
our education here in Maastricht. Would that do for participating in
the challenge?

Hello All

Some information on the newly formed Open Science Finland group has just
been posted on the working group blog:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/03/25/announcing-open-science-finland/

If you're from Finland and interested in getting involved please see the
post for details on how to do so.
It's great to see more local open science groups forming! If you'd like to
start one in your area or already have an initiative you'd like to spread
the word about, let the list (or me) know.

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] bottom-up events for gifted education (and not only)
Message-ID: <FF3F7288-2810-49F7-A8E0-64031F0E3038@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm Piotr Migdal, a PhD student in quantum optics, drifting to complex systems, data science and programming. From Poland, now in Barcelona.


I hope not to get to much off-topic (as it is rather on a bottom-up initiative in education than on open science per se).
However, I believe that many key issues  of academia and education (including ones with opening up!) have their roots in the structure of top-down large-scale institutions, with their typical inertia (and hierarchical decision processes, which suppress real innovations).


I've co-written an article on an independent camp for talented high school students, which I've been co-organizing:
http://warsztatywww.wikidot.com/en:indie-camp-for-hs-geeks 
It's about:
- how to reach talented kids (and why we never ask about one?s grades or recommendation letters),
- working in an informal atmosphere (where the only things that matter are skills and knowledge),
- bottom-up initiatives (how to bootstrap a valuable event without institutional or financial support),
- emphasis on broadening intellectual horizons and sharing knowledge (as compared to preparation for exams or competitions).

If you have any similar (or opposite) observations on teaching whizzkids, or bootstrapping an event, I would love to hear your voice!
(And even more - if you want to organize one!
At least a blueprint for organizing this camp is open, and I will share it with anyone asking (and I'll put online, once polished).)


And in general (i.e. bottom-up initiatives, not only gifted education), IMHO, the good thing is that:
- starting from a niche is something a group of friends can do, being unrestricted by typical constrains (like university's policy), 
- it is possible to think in a way beyond "how to slightly modify educational or academic world"
(e.g. many assumptions about an age- and grade-based system can be challenged, creating  a place where people go to learn and get inspired, not to get credentials or diplomas; or that teaching should be done only by research workers).


As I side note, I am aware of (and excited by) more organized camps and courses for sake of learning, not diploma-making, e.g.
https://www.hackerschool.com/
http://www.bigdive.eu/ (which I attended and recommend wholeheartedly, if someone is (or want to be) in Data Science)
http://insightdatascience.com/
(not even to mention many e-ducation sites).
Also, I hope/dream that one day there will be a research program based on skills, regardless of one's academic title.


Regards,
Piotr Migdal

Super - thanks for the advice Rebecca.

Is anyone in the open science group interested in working with the RDA to
take a more proactive stance on open data?

Dear all,

Al-Jazeera English has been calling for fresh and insightful op-eds by
women, as a means to balance a bit the 80:20 men:women op-ed authors on
their website. I chose to speak about open & citizen science, as these
aren't regular topics covered by this media which, btw, benefits from a
very wide audience world over. I was glad to have my contribution going
live earlier, and thought to share with you :) Any comment welcome!

Good night!

Hi Piotr,

You should check the on-line course Learning Creative
Learning<http://learn.media.mit.edu/>by MIT Medialab. I think you can
use some of their discussed techniques
along the course.

Cheers,

While we hope that the data we curated would be of interest [1], you are
free to use any open data set for the challenge! In fact, we would be really
happy to see a submission building on an initiative like WikiPathways!
So I look forward to your submission and do get in touch with our team [2]
if you have any further questions or would like to discuss what you intend
to do. We would love to hear from you!

Thanks,

Sander

I'd like to further commend Rayna's excellent article in Al Jazeera

Tinkering knowledge sharing, or why we need to hack science (25th March,
2013)
http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/03/2013325182246584689.html

It includes a lot of interesting projects I have to confess I wasn't aware
of before
e.g.
http://www.wikikids.nl/
http://fr.vikidia.org/wiki/Accueil
http://nestwatch.org/

Here's an extract (but do go and read the whole piece and watch the videos
too!):

"The cliche of the lonely scholar with an unhealthy look and asocial
behaviour is still widespread, but gets more and more pervasive as
communication technologies advance. What remains true, however, is the
conservatism and rigidity of research institutions. Science is built upon
data collection, analysis, critique and reuse, yet the ordinary
science-doing as imposed by research institutions requires secrecy, thus
working against the maximisation of knowledge dissemination. Before one
screams about paranoia, think of paywalls locking studies from access,
publication of datasets as PDFs or even images.

The reluctance to publish data and share knowledge openly has, however,
started to attract people's attention. A general move towards openness
generally referred to as "open
science<http://science.okfn.org/2012/11/28/making-open-science-possible-global-young-academy-statement-on-open-science/>
" has emerged, inspired from the spirit of the free and open source
software (FOSS) movement. Similarly to FOSS ethics, promoting software
source code to be made public, reusable and modifiable by anyone, the
central theme of open science is to clearly account for methods, generated
data and obtained results thus enabling a massively distributed
collaboration that speeds up the pace at which science is done.

A very powerful concept - "citizen science" - has naturally emerged along
the lines of open science. Countless professional researchers blog about
their work and discuss online results obtained by their peers. Such open
discussion permits non-professionals to participate as well. The surge of
the hacker/maker/do-it-yourself movement has tremendously contributed to
engage non-professional scientists in science."


Best,

Ross

Many thanks, Ross! I'll be announcing the French Open Science group shortly
:) Was thinking of featuring a different citizen science project every week
(a short description, just to whet people's appetite for the topic ;) ) in
addition to starting to build original projects. How does this sound to
you?

Thanks :)

Dear all,

I wanted to draw your attention to a special collection of commentaries and
features that Nature published today:
http://www.nature.com/news/the-future-of-publishing-a-new-page-1.12665

If you attempt to read some of the commentaries, chances are big you face a
paywall (examples with John Wilbanks's piece + one entitled "Advocacy: How
to Hasten Open Access").

Enjoy when possible...

Entire library journal editorial board resigns, citing 'crisis of
conscience' after death of Aaron Swartz

In a dramatic show of support for the open access movement, the
editor-in-chief and entire editorial board of the Journal of Library
Administration announced their resignation last week. In a letter to
contributors, the board singled out a conflict with owners over the
journal's licensing terms, which stripped authors of almost all claim
to ownership of their work.

otherwise the conclusions will not be really "useful". In other words, I
think that you would like to say in your stories or results page, that a
given paper was reported as closed and that N different people agreed that
it is closed for public view.

These are just random thoughts, I'm just brainstorming :-) Comments are
welcomed!

Cheers,

v>Hi Joe,<br><br></div>I
 think the connections with OAButton and CrowdCrafting have a lot of=20
possibilities. From my point of view, one that could be very useful for=20
you is the validation of reported closed papers/journals:<br>
<br></div>1.- A user reports a blocked paper with your tool.<br></div>2.- Y=
our server stores that info, and automatically creates a task in a CrowdCra=

 so you can statistically analyzed the answers regarding if it is closed or=
 not.<br>


</div>4.- You get all the answers for that specific paper, validate them, a=

</div>2.- People answer all the questions that he wants to address, plus on=

 They gather all the answers, do the statistical analysis, and with the=20

<br></div>If you want, they can include the button as part of the task.=20
The idea is to report directly to your platform which papers are not=20

 to have &quot;validated revisions&quot;. What do you think? <br>
<br>From my experience, crowdsourced projects should include a=20

that a reference is (1) free to read and (2) licensed such that
materials from it can be reused in Wikipedia articles (i.e. CC BY-SA
or compatible).

Once he first few of the IPCC references have been processed, I should
be happy to run a demo.

would have more impact than just the OASPA group post, as only researchers
interested in this specific topic will read about it.

Just to give you an idea, I originally found the link to the National
Geographic article in a web about general news, in other words: that
article was read by lots of people getting the impression that OA journals
are bad.

I guess that a letter from all the groups I mentioned, saying why that
article is not fair, it would help to get awareness of the problem and make
a clear point about what is the position of these open science groups
regarding this topic. Additionally I guess it could reach a lot of people
and open the discussion, due to it will be a letter answering the Economist
article, and signed by three main players, well known and respected by the
world.

Cheers,

Daniel

<div dir=3D"ltr"><div><div><div>Hi,<br><br></div>I like the idea proposed f=
rom Francois. A joint message from OKF science group, <a href=3D"https://wi=
ki.mozilla.org/ScienceLab">Mozilla Science Lab </a>and <a href=3D"http://cr=
eativecommons.org/science">Creative Commons Science</a> about this topic re=
garding the Economist article would be very valuable in my opinion. <br>

<br>From my point of view, it would send the right message, and I guess it =
would have more impact than just the OASPA group post, as only researchers =
interested in this specific topic will read about it. <br><br>Just to give =
you an idea, I originally found the link to the National Geographic article=
 in a web about general news, in other words: that article was read by lots=
 of people getting the impression that OA journals are bad.<br>

<br></div>I guess that a letter from all the groups I mentioned, saying why=
 that article is not fair, it would help to get awareness of the problem an=
d make a clear point about what is the position of these open science group=
s regarding this topic. Additionally I guess it could reach a lot of people=
 and open the discussion, due to it will be a letter answering the Economis=
t article, and signed by three main players, well known and respected by th=
e world.<br>

that some publishers (or better: editorial boards) that do not do<br></div>
