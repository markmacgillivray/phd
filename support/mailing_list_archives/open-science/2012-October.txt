This conversation with Tim O'Reilly touches on various Open Science/Access
points and may be of interest to people:

http://edge.org/conversation/-39the-clothesline-paradox-39-

Abstract:
*If we're going to get science policy right, it's really important for us
to study the economic benefit of open access and not accept the arguments
of incumbents. Existing media companies claim that they need ever stronger
and longer copyright protection and new, draconian laws to protect them,
and meanwhile, new free ecosystems, like the Web, have actually led to
enormous wealth creation and enormous new opportunities for social value.
And yes, they did in fact lead in some cases to the destruction of
incumbents, but that's the kind of creative destruction that we should
celebrate in the economy. We have to accept that, particularly in the area
of science, there's an incredible opportunity for open access to enable new
business models.*

Great Jenny,

Yes - for me this is one of the major missions of the OKF - how can we
monetize "free"?  Tim is right and understands the dynamics of the web in a
way that few other publishers do. We need inventive ideas - some of which
will fail - and we need a wide range of partners.

Dear open-science readers,

You might be interested to read a longish blog post I wrote about a recent high impact research article (alas, not open access; let me know if you want to read it and don't have access) I co-authored with Jani Kotakoski. It contains some interesting statistics of the email correspondence as well as inside details of the process, somewhat along the ideals of open science.

Yours sincerely,
Toma Susi

Dear Heather,

Thank you for the comment. Actually, I think the situation with ACS is not that clear at the moment, as there have been worrying reports on their practices very recently:

http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/information-culture/2012/09/28/a-small-college-cancels-acs-journal-subscriptions-heres-why-this-matters/
http://www.nature.com/news/chemical-society-tried-to-block-business-competitor-1.11470

However, they do publish some of the best journals in my field and I would much rather see reform than a boycott, unlike in the case of Elsevier.

I'm definitely following the situation closely and will write about it if more information becomes available.

-Toma

Congratulations, Toma.

It isn't often that the open access movement recognizes the value of societies like the American Chemical Society in the creation of a open access to scholarly knowledge.

It is good to see from the ACS website that they have Congressional Briefings - one indication that a strong society like this has the ability and opportunity to speak up for science.  Their educational programs really are of value to building knowledge and scholarship. We tend to think of ACS as behaving in a similar way to for-profit commercial publishers, but despite some superficial resemblances, this really is not the case. Like other scholarly societies, their journals on a per-article basis are a fraction of the cost of those of the highest profit commercial publishers.

When the American Association for the Advancement of Science was here for their meeting in Vancouver earlier this year, it was good to see that they had a session on muzzling of Canadian government scientists. Advocating for scholars and scholarly values is just one of the important functions of scholarly societies.

A future environment for scholarly communication that is beneficial for scholars as well as open access needs these societies. What all of us need to do to transition is to address the underlying economics to help them transition to open access.

best,

Heather Morrison

This is a carefully detailed account of collaboration in authoring a
conventional closed access paper. I think many may find it useful.  I think
it stresses collaboration, the problems of refereeing and editors, but it
isn't similar to open science. So my comments are primarily about that...
Please take them as constructive.

In a full open science process the major part of the research would have
been posted openly and would potentially have been available to people
outside the research group both for reading and comment.

If the open process is restricted to authoring then the manuscripts would
have been posted openly. You mention a large  number of emails and
Googledocs. Googledocs is a relatively poor vehicle for scientific
manuscripts as it has poor version/control and poor reference management.
Indeed this is an area where I would like to see open offerings that
address these points.

You have submitted to journals (ACS) which will refuse to publish if *any*
of the work has appeared in public anywhere. For example, in the distant
days when I published with ACS, we published a paper on the CML schema.
(This is in the field of cheminformatics and ACS was the only publisher
anywhere who would accept papers on this topic - we now have Open Access
alternatives.) I asked the editor if we could post the schema for public
comment and this was refused. Nowadays I would simply do it. The ACS does
not allow Green archival of any sort except in dark archives with large
embargo times (probably decades).

Your initial paper - on which I can't comment as there is no public record
of it was required by the journals to be bounced around different
publishers. It was both too long for some and too short for others and
looks like your original paper has been split into two by the journal
system. The first, as I understand it, is 4 pages and contains little
useful experimental detail - this will be published separately. Is this the
best way to publish the science? I don't know since none of the versions
are publicly accessible.

The message I take from this is that the journal system puts serious
pressures on where and how to publish. In open-science we don't have this
problem. We publish to the world and record everything. We (or someone
else!) can write narratives on the data.

If we limit this to open-access (i.e. do the science closed but publish
openly in conventional journals) this emphasizes the need for a versioned
record of the publication. All significant versions should be available for
public view and comment. It may be that you would find public support for
your original manuscript or you may find there were significant flaws.

This has been a useful example and my suggestion is that this list
(open-access) should think about open authoring tools. It's clear that a
huge amount of wasted effort is created by the re-authoring process -
reformatting, re-doing the reference labels, etc. In OKF we have an
emerging toolkit that will address some of these points.

Indeed. Would it be publicly visible or would it need a private
subscription. And presumably it could be opened later.
Github is so much more attractive for scholarly manuscripts than DSpace,

Dear Peter,

Your remarks are welcome and very well taken; perhaps it was an exaggeration to talk about open science (although I did write I'm inspired and not practicing it, but that's semantics).

I wonder what term would be better here? Discussing openly what happens typically behind closed doors and high in the ivory towers of science is surely useful even if it's not strictly open science.

I'll have to tell you that our senior co-authors were not comfortable with even this level of openness, and we had to remove some correspondence from the post on their request.

So we're pushing as much as we can, but what a wise man once said seems to hold still: science advances one funeral at a time.

In any case, I appreciate the interest and taking the time to answer in length!

-Toma

 It is good to see from the ACS website that they have Congressional

as behaving in a similar way to for-profit commercial publishers, but
despite some superficial resemblances, this really is not the case. Like
other scholarly societies, their journals on a per-article basis are a
fraction of the cost of those of the highest profit commercial publishers.

 The ACS has strongly and consistently lobbied Congress to oppose Openness.
The worst of these was when it tried to get PubChem shut down (a valuable
free database of chemicals created by the NIH). It has also been a member
of PRISM whose strapline was to brand the Open Access movement as "junk
science". It has a monopoly in education where those wishing to get courses
accredited have to subscribe to ACS journals.

I have had many years of following ACS policies including attempts to
"reform" them and I am not optimistic that change will come naturally.

I agreed it was useful! It makes a very strong case for  trying to find a

To: okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org


 Hi everyone,

If you saw James Cameron or Hans Rosling's speeches at OKFestival, you'll
have heard them both call for Open Data to tackle environmental problems,
particularly around opening up emissions data and so on.

There is a huge list of things that could be done, from opening up
environmental methodologies (AMEE recently opened their datasets, for
example), to improving scientific climate data, to national emissions
reporting, to visualisation, and there are some things going on in all
these areas already.

I know a few people have been talking about maybe doing some of this within
OKFN, but I thought I'd try to pull the conversation together so we can all
work together instead of stepping on each others' toes!

So, who's interested in this sort of thing, and what would you be
interested in doing? Are you already doing it? Are there parts that are
more or less appropriate for OKFN's mission? What fits, and what should be
handled elsewhere?

We can discuss here initially, but could then move to a smaller list; there
are some fairly dormant-seeming OKFN WGs and lists that might be relevant
homes for the conversation, and we also have the cleanweb-uk list which is
full of people interested in this sort of thing (see http://cleanweb.org.uk
).

cheers,
James

An Open Letter to the Library Community



At ACS Publications, our goal is to provide the most
authoritative and indispensable peer-reviewed research and chemistry
related
information through our portfolio of 41 journals and other publications. We
recognize this is only possible through a committed partnership with you,
our
library customers, and the research communities you support.


We value this partnership and we apologize for our recent failure
to make clear the importance we place on our dialogue with libraries and
scholarly communications departments.  We
aim to do better, and are grateful for the ongoing close consultation and
collaboration we have with libraries and consortia worldwide in helping
shape our
subscription and publishing options as we move from the print past to the
digital present.


As a result of this collaboration, more scientists have
access to more ACS journals through more libraries than at any time during
ACS?s 136-year history. This year, the ACS Web Editions platform will host
more
than 1,000,000 original articles and will successfully fulfill over 80
million
article requests from the global scientific community. We thank you for
working
with us to make such broad and immediate information access a reality,
particularly in light of the economic stress faced by so many libraries
today.


We realize that no pricing model is ever perfect ? and that in
this difficult economic era, we have heard your concerns about ensuring
future
access to the essential and highly cited research found in ACS
Publications.  Publishers and libraries have a shared stake
in sustainability: ACS is committed to working with you to refine and
improve
our approach and welcomes an ongoing dialogue with you about library and
research trends, publishing best practices, and shared economic concerns.


Over the next 6 months, we will expand our consultations
with the library community to ensure we have the features, access options,
and
publishing models that meet your expectations and the needs of the
communities
you serve. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call your ACS
Publications representative with any questions, or contact me directly at
brandon.nordin at acs.org to share your concerns and suggestions. More
information
on 2013 renewal options is also available at the Librarian Resource Center
at http://pubs.acs.org.

Thank you for your partnership and for your support of ACS
Publications and the American Chemical Society.

Hi Toma,

Thanks for sharing this with us. (and great to meet you in person at
OKFestival btw!)

As a young scientist myself with relatively little experience of the
publication process, I did find your post illuminating - particularly the
Mail Trends analyses showing how much 'behind the scenes' work and years(!)
of effort goes into each and every publication! I suspect many outside
academia don't realise quite how much work goes into a paper sometimes.


May I suggest you post a Green OA copy of your published paper online
somewhere so people don't even need to email you for a copy of your work?
[Sometimes I email authors for a copy & they are on holiday, or away on
fieldwork and so don't reply for ages; this slows down the pace of science]

I had a quick look on Sherpa/Romeo about ACS Nano here:
http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php and from what I read it said
"subject to Restrictions below, author can archive publisher's version/PDF:

Restrictions:

   - If mandated by funding agency or employer/ institution
   - Must obtain written permission from Editor confirming posting does not
   conflict prior publication policies
   - If mandated to deposit before 12 months, must obtain waiver from
   Institution/ Agency or use AuthorChoice 12 months"

also "General Conditions:


   - Must be accompanied by set statement (see policy)
   - Must link to publisher version"


clearly ACS are using very draconian terms and conditions to impede authors
from doing this easily (as I understand it ACS are
notedly<http://www.nature.com/news/chemical-society-tried-to-block-business-competitor-1.11470>
one
of the least open,morally
questionable<http://www.attemptingelegance.com/?p=1765> Learned
Societies in academia!).

Does Aalto University have an Open Access mandate?

For example, my institution University of Bath recently implemented
one here<http://www.bath.ac.uk/library/services/eprints/deposit-mandate.pdf>.
Not that it's been particularly effective so far (perhaps it needs time to
become effective?) but that's another story...
This has allowed me to post a freely available version of my first
publication here: http://opus.bath.ac.uk/25606/ with no hassle from the
publisher about it.


It's great to see more scientists like yourself thinking about how to make
the process of science more open, even if only in retrospect after
publication - it all does count on some level.


Best,

Ross

Interesting story, and post, thank you. We've written, and are writing,
papers openly on a wiki:

http://openwetware.org/wiki/Todd:Construction

and that works for a group of people collaborating on the assembly of a
paper where the members of the group are OK with the platform, but it's
really not everyone's cup of tea, and formatting/referencing is still a
pain. Conversion to an acceptable form for submission is also lengthy.
We're about to share the first draft of our open source drug discovery for
malaria paper, which we've been assembling recently, and are a little stuck
on how best to do this. It's not the sharing (easy), it's the
expecting-people-to-be-able-to-input-without-being-coders problem. We need
a github of Word files, I expect, and could use Dropbox for that if we are
clear about how to manage the process, but the reference management is
always going to be difficult - some people insist on Endnote, others on
Mendeley, etc. We know that submission to a PLoS journal, for example, will
be acceptable once we're done.

Cheers,

Mat

Hi  All.

I have been following the discussion with great interest and yes,, like
Ross, Peter and Matthew i think it is interesting to gain an insight in the
makijng of a paper process
I have been using google doc to write up a draft for a paper , and is less
than optimal especially because of formatting issues. And then especially
because of reference formats.
I have taken the paer out when it was (almost) ready and used refmanager
integrated with word to get the bibliography done. But then this choice is
because I have been using Refman since Version 1 .

Tom.

I have copied this to Open Bibliography. These are my first thoughts.

At present we have 2 authors (for simplicity). A uses Endnote, B uses
Mendeley. A provides a manuscript in GoogleDocs and then has to dump it out
in Word so A can add references then puts it back in Google docs then B has
to dump it into ?Latex and add refs and put it back. This is non-optimal

Let's take a Bibserver BibSoup as representing the communal references of
the paper. This can be communally built and edited (right Mark?). We have
1:1 bidirectional converters for major formats (e.g. RIS (EndNote) <-->
BibJSON (Bibserver format)). At least we can create the communal references
in whatever authoring format people want. Is there a way to solve the rest
of the problem?

Subject: [open-science] Open Research Funding or How the NSF allocates
 billions of federal dollars to top universities
Message-ID: <5073289C.4090406@scinoptica.com>

Dear List,


this is probably not located at the heart of Open Science, but I guess 
it is interesting nevertheless (and a wonderful example for the benefits 
of Open Data): The Sunlight Foundation analysed the NSF's funding budget 
and detected (not very surprisingly) a strong Matthew-effect: 
http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/09/13/nsf-funding/

Two money quotes as appetizers:

?Twenty percent of top research universities got 61.6% of the NSF 
funding going to top research universities between 2008 and 2011.?

"Even when controlling for other factors, we find that for each 
additional employee a university has serving on an NSF advisory 
committee that university can expect to see an additional $125,000 to 
$138,000 in NSF funding."

Findings like these raise the question to what extent funding is part of 
any Open Science scenarios. Perhaps someone on the list knows more abut 
Open Funding and is willing to share this information.

Best regards


Ulrich Herb

I also was a sinner and then saw the light. My blog was CC-NC when it
started. I made the "natural" assumption that because I was an academic I
should use NC. We need to stop people falling into that trap before they
start.

I second that! I wrote to Cameron off-line, but am happy to repeat it here: 

"You are summing up and explaining the issues with an almost incredible, and enviable, clarity"

And Mike is right, very tactful, too.

from the brochure:

article free after 12-month

=
"Article full text, metadata,
& citations may be crawled
without special permission
or registration"

No, even if the article is free after 12 month, the terms of services of
the publisher's website still apply. The copyright is still there and the
terms of services, so as far as I know, you can't crawl the articles...
officially at least... :-)

Your point is well taken, Heather, but this is really about getting
together *anyone* who has an interest in thinking through new ways of
doing things. This is a long, long ways from anything approaching a
standard, and much more input from various communities will be
solicited, because the whole point, as I wrote earlier this month (
http://www.guardian.co.uk/higher-education-network/blog/2012/sep/06/mendeley-altmetrics-open-access-publishing
) is for us to get away from the "one metric to rule them all"
situation we have had.

So this process will be led by those who put in the time and effort to
develop an implementation, which means that it will have input from
scholars both in and out of academia. I am one such scholar who cares
enough to devote time to work on this, Jason, Heather and Jennifer are
also scholars who are devoting their time to this, and that's why
we're spreading the word.  Any assistance you can provide in
recruiting interested stakeholders is more than welcome.

Spot on.  The altmetrics hackathon is about getting together ANYONE AND
EVERYONE interested in helping to build things that will inform future
metrics.  It is early for standards, but it is high time for experimenting!


There are scholars-turned-builders emerging from all over the place to help
explore the future of scholarly communication.  Jason Priem and I are two,
Todd Vision at Dryad is another, Martin Fenner now at PLOS is another, Mark
Hahnel of figshare is another, Elizabeth Iorns of Science Exchange, William
Gunn at Mendeley, I won't bore you with a laundry list but there are oodles
more in academia and out....
If we are publisher friends now, it is because we've found ourselves
working side by side to build real things :)

Please join us, everyone!  The hackathon is going to be great: San
Francisco on Sat Nov 3rd.  Everyone is welcome, whether you code or
not.  Register
here <http://altmetricshackathon2012.eventbrite.com/>, view ideas and share
your own here<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hJixj2z6oSpFIosQQlGXFbrOBLR8te3VZgzdvcMedTA/edit#bookmark=id.atzvn4t9is2s>,
can't wait to meet you!

Please point me toward one or more short introductions, for a computational and scientific audience, to current options for data sharing and archiving. Why I ask:

I attended a conference today for users and developers of an atmospheric model. Mostly it was presentations of research results, but we also had a long general meeting about the model, its development, and (mostly) the need for related tools and infrastructures. One topic was the need for better data sharing and management: we currently tend to physically ship a lot of physical hard drives after searching our social networks for folks with needed datasets. One response is to start a torrent network, but we also need ways/places to archive (preferably searchably). I gave a quick OTTOMH talk about some repository options which I'm aware (pangaea.de, figshare.com, thedatahub.org) and gave props to OKF.

I'd like to follow that up with pointers to more information (seed the discussion, to continue the torrent metaphor :-) and would appreciate your advice regarding appropriate sources of information on the topic. (Evangelism is OK too: while definitely international, this is a mostly-US group which is generally unexposed to open-science norms.)

What follows is my own opinion ...
We are at a very early stage in this and there are no standard approaches.
It differs greatly between disciplines. A few disciplines require data to
be reposited in full (e.g. crystallography). I'd add
http://datadryad.org/to your list.  Figshare was started because there
was no communal solution.

Funders are starting to require data management but they don't say how.

The key thing is that your discipline owns the problem. A good solution
might be a learned society, but this doesnt always work out - IMO the Am
Chem Soc is a problem rather than a solution. A number of journals require
deposition whereas others actively refuse to take data.

Hi Tom,

This is a great case study, as it illustrates some of the challenges to be
found when one gets down to the details in a specific discipline.  While
FigShare and Dryad and OKF are awesome for a lot of things, I don't think
they are the best choice for this type of data.  There is a
well-established set of data repositories for atmospheric data in the US
and other countries that would be set up to handle this (like the Oak Ridge
National Lab DAAC that houses similar data, or the National Snow and Ice
Data Center, or the National Oceanographic Data Center), and they already
are dealing with atmospheric modeling data like you describe.

Just today I was talking to folks from the MsTMIP project that is dealing
with comparison of model outputs for global atmospheric carbon models, and
the consensus there is that these model output data sets are each in the
one to multi-terabyte range (http://nacp.ornl.gov/mast-dc/MsTMIP.shtml).
 If your data are similar, then they likely are not appropriate for
web-based data upload systems as exemplified by FigShare, or even network
transfer at all.  They most often are moved around by FedExing hard drives,
or on dedicated high-speed networks over protocols like GridFTP that
support parallelism in network transfers (but even then it is painful).

There are efforts like GEOSS and the DataONE (http://dataone.org) project
that I'm involved in that are trying to enable interoperability among these
many extant repositories so that the data can be discovered regardless of
where they are housed.  Dryad and the ORNL DAAC and the KNB and many other
repositories are working together to see this happen.  I hope that you can
chose an existing repository that is set up for your scale of data and be
able to have it fit into a larger federation.  If do decide to try to
upload atmospheric model data to FigShare, you should certainly contact
them beforehand so you don't give their sysadmins a heart attack, and to be
sure that you meet their restrictions (e.g., for Dryad, data need to be
associated with a specific publication).  I know a number of people that
are working on this specific issue concerning archiving and discovery
of atmospheric data, and I'd be happy to put you in touch with them if you
were interested.

Regards,

Matt

As (barely) mentioned: CMAQ's community is regulatory as well as
research. Without going deep-dive in detail, the model is widely used
by governments and NGOs to forecast air quality, and this use is often
required by law. Hence,

* academic publication is not relevant for much of our community

* much data of interest is currently "published" via things like
  court dockets, which are not easy to find or parse

Hence Dryad seems not to serve a large proportion of our population,
but it's definitely worth adding for those who it might.

Thanks for those suggestions. I'm more aware of NOAA's NCDC. My
impression is, establishing oneself as a contributor at these federal
repositories is often difficult if one is not a federal entity. Is
that correct?

> model output data sets are each in the one to multi-terabyte range

Actually, most of the interest expressed at the meeting regarded
reference *input* datasets used to setup runs, which are *much*
smaller.

Please do. CMAQers definitely seemed interested, so I'd like to
provide folks with options for followup. (And then get back to my
thesis :-)

A quick email on scientific data archives (I'm at a conference in North
Carolina atm, so apologies for the conciseness)

In addition to those already mentioned there are:

LabArchives: http://www.labarchives.com/

commercial, have made a deal with BMC to be BMC's data repository for all
future research publications. Press release about this here:
http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/04/04/labarchives-and-biomed-central-a-new-platform-for-publishing-scientific-data/

on the theme of torrents, you may be interested in BioTorrents which I
think is for sharing large Biological data & whole dumps of ALL of PLoS
(OA) publications: http://www.biotorrents.net/browse.php It's described in
this PLoS publication:
http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0010071

finally, some smaller scale, niche data-specific repositories from my
domain:

http://www.morphobank.org/  (phylogenetic morphological character matrices
& images)
http://www.morphbank.net/ (different, just about images really AFAIK)
http://treebase.org/<http://treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html;jsessionid=CD1A9022218AD33385F7A15B7E7BC1DE>
(phylogenetic trees & matrices, but it only has <4% of what's actually
published in the literature which is rather sad - people just don't seem to
submit their data there because the journals tend not to mandate this
process)
http://paleodb.org/ <http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl> (paleontological
data) fairly strict about who can & can't edit/add data to this


Best,

Ross

Hi all,
if you go here http://www.biosharing.org/standards_view and query (top 
right box) for *imaging *you will see few results.
BioSharing catalogue is work in progress, so bear with us, but we keep 
adding (community) standards and improves searches and classifications 
also in collaboration with the BioPortal team.
Thanks,
Susanna

The JoRD project - part of the JISC Managing Research Data Programme - and the researcher questionnaire which it has just released may be of interest to subscribers to the OKF List.  

Best wishes, 

Simon.

Subject: JoRD (Journal Research Data Policy Bank) Researcher Survey

** Apologies for cross-posting**

Dear Colleagues,

JoRD (Journal Research Data Policy Bank) is a JISC funded initiative conducting a feasibility study into the scope and shape of a service to collate and summarise journal policies on Research Data. Such a service could provide researchers, managers of research data and other stakeholders with a central source of reference to understand and comply with these policies.

The project has just launched an online survey aimed at researchers. The survey is part of the stakeholder consultation phase of the project and aims to gauge researcher opinions/practices concerning research data, data sharing, the policies of journals, and thoughts on the shape of such a service.

The results of the survey will allow us to build a picture of researcher needs and will help inform recommendations made by the report.

To begin, please click the survey URL below:

http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/GZVP5ZS

Please feel free to distribute the survey link to anyone whom you feel may be relevant.

The closing date for the survey is Sunday 04th November.

More information on the JoRD project and our findings so far can be found on the project blog (https://jordproject.wordpress.com/).

Many thanks in advance for your help.

Kind regards,

I'd also like to point your attention to the Research Data Alliance
(http://www.rd-alliance.org/), which is a _very_ new international
advisory group being formed to create standards that can help with not
only sharing data openly, but enabling more interdisciplinary
research.

This is a great discussion with plenty of useful information.

We are trying to document some of this guidance in the Open Research Data
Handbook - still very much a work in progress!

If anyone feels able to contribute a short section on this, please do so!
We are drafting on booki. Anyone is welcome either to contribute to an
existing section (NB: some are currently placeholders only) or add a new
section themselves.

Outline here: http://www.booki.cc/open-research-data-handbook/

Cheers,
Laura

All,

A couple of links to add to this discussion.  There are currently - to my knowledge - two projects working to produce a directory or registry of data repositories: i.e. a useful 'look-up service for researchers or research support staff wanting to know where given data might find an open and sustainable home.  These are:

DataBib from Purdue University, described as 'a searchable catalog / registry / directory / bibliography of research data repositories': http://databib.org/

Re3Data, a DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft / German Research Foundation) funded project which aims to produce a registry of research data repositories: http://www.re3data.org/

Best,

Simon.

All,

And more, but with a bioscience focus:
- http://www.biosharing.org/biodbcore (building on the catalogue of 
biostandards and linking databases that use them; work done with NAR 
database journal)
- http://www.neuinfo.org/ NIF portal

Lemme know if this structure does/not work. If the former, I'll try to

Hello all,

There was a landmark US court decision the other week regarding fair use of digitized library materials that grew out of a lawsuit between the HathiTrust and the Authors Guild: http://www.educause.edu/blogs/cheverij/hathitrust-decision-win-fair-use-and-use-technology

IANAL, but it was just brought to my attention that the ruling appears to be extremely favorable to the idea that many applications of text-mining would fall under the definition of fair use according to US law (which is notoriously murky about what does or doesn't constitute fair use).

The text of the ruling is here.  http://www.scribd.com/doc/109646807/The-Authors-Guild-Inc-et-al-v-Hathitrust-et-al-Opinion-and-OrderParticularly 

Pages 16, 21 and 22 discuss text-mining specifically.

cheers,
Todd

*** Apologies for cross-posting ***

The OpenAIRE consortium has the pleasure to announce its second conference:

*OpenAIRE Conference "Enlightenment in the Knowledge Society"*

Date: 21-22 November 2012

Location: G?ttingen State and University Library, G?ttingen, Germany

Registration is free, and open at:

http://www.openaire.eu/en/conference2012

The conference will present the results of the OpenAIRE project which 
supports the European Commission's FP7 Open Access Pilot.^It will 
feature a picture of the open access & supporting infrastructure 
landscape in Europe and offer views ranging from researcher's views on 
scientific information, to the role of data infrastructures, research 
institutions and funders. This will offer a fitting context to Horizon 
2020, where open access will be a general principle for all European 
researchprogrammes. The programme will also give insight into the 
OpenAIREplus project, which will link publications to research data, 
enabling seamless access to scientific knowledge.

The meeting is organized by OpenAIRE and OpenAIREplus, with the support 
of the Directorate Generals for Communications Networks, Content and 
Technology(CONNECT) and Research and Innovation (RTD). Invitees are 
decision makers and other stakeholders in research from all EU Member 
States and further Associated countries. The event is co-hosted by 
G?ttingen University, founded in 1734 during the Enlightenment. 
G?ttingen's spirit of learning has been transferred to the 21^st century 
by the promotion of open access successfully both in Europe and 
internationally. The Conference will send an appropriate signal to the 
European community at a time when the Commission's Communication & 
Recommendation on Scientific Information are being discussed in European 
member states.

The conference will start on 21 November noon and ends on 22 November at 
the same time. The first day of the conference will be rounded off with 
a conference dinner. The programme will be available online soon.

The OpenAIRE community would be delighted to welcome you in G?ttingen.

Contact:

Subject: [open-science] The Current State of Open Access Repository
 Interoperability - New COAR Report
Message-ID: <CAJtxkcrwkBheEzrC9y7kyjoTi6-+8E8F57uUkpvSf9am0vBMTQ@mail.gmail.com>

**Apologies for Cross Posting**

The Confederation of Open Access Repositories
<http://www.coar-repositories.org/>(COAR) is pleased to announce
publication of the report, *The Current State of Open Access Repository
Interoperability (2012)*. The report provides an overview of the current
interoperability landscape in terms of the types of services that are now
possible because of recent research and development efforts from throughout
the Open Access community, and it presents interoperability initiatives in
connection to these services. ****

** **
The intended audience includes institutions and repository managers
operating at different points in terms of infrastructure, resources, and
institutional support. For institutions new to Open Access and
repositories, the report aims to provide guidance for getting started and
indicates which interoperability initiatives are necessary to implement in
order to achieve specific services. For institutions and repository
managers already involved in OA and repositories, the report may provide
ideas for additional functionality to add to your repository or further
services that are possible to provide to your community.


The report covers seven areas of focus for current
interoperability initiatives, and it provides overviews of nineteen key
interoperability initiatives.

Dear all,

I would like to invite you to read and discuss the blog article of Ross
Mounce on the Open Economics Blog. We invited him to discuss the open
access for economists, as he is well-versed in the open access options for
science and for the occasion of the Open Access
Week<http://www.openaccessweek.org/>this week (22-28 October):

Week Video!
To: SPARC Open Data <sparc-opendata at arl.org>


Hello All,

It's already been such a lively, interactive, and productive Open Access
Week 2012. And now the Right to Research Coalition just launched an amazing
video in collaboration with PhD Comics to really wrap up the week nicely.
The video entitled ?Open Access Explained!? is the perfect resource to give
colleagues a quick glimpse into the many reasons why Open Access to
research is important for students, researchers, and so many other
stakeholders.

Please take a look, pass around, use in your remaining OA Week events, and
post: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5rVH1KGBCY&feature=player_embedded

Happy OA Week to you and yours. We hope to have an informational wrap up of
the many events that took place (and continue to take place) this week!
Speaking of which don't forget to keep the posts of your events up to date
on our Open Access Week Website.

Best,

Andrea

Nicely researched and written article. Hopefully some practising economists
will be able to add and fill in details.

For example, how do view open science? Do you think linking data is

your research, how you view open access, what we could do to change it and

I think that sounds like our kind of thing so I hope several of you can

OpenTech 2013 is an informal, low cost, one-day conference on slightly

different approaches to technology, experience and democracy. Talks by
people who work on things that matter, guarantees a day of thoughtful
talks leading to conversations with friends.<

On 18th May, OpenTech is as much about conversations in the bar, as
it is sitting in sessions. What topics would you like to be
discussed with a range of people? The best way of getting
the OpenTech audience to think about the challenges you
have, is by sharing what they are and solutions you've
already found, by offering a talk.

OpenTech 2013 is sponsored by the Open Data Institute. The ODI
enables anyone to learn and engage with open data, and empowers
teams to help others through professional coaching and
mentoring.http://theodi.org - Knowledge for Everyone

*Talks*

Are there community projects that you work on that would
benefit from more support? Are you working on problems that
you think others might help solve? What talks would you like
to see one friend tell your other friends about? What have you
done/seen that you thought would work (or not), where something
else happened instead?

Offer a talk online at www.opentech.org.uk or emailopentech at ukuug.org
and we'll have a chat. If you can get us
submissions (even just outline submissions) by the 1st of
April, that'd be grand.


What's the day going to have?
    - Open in Theory & Practice
    - Highlights, lowlights and lessons learned
    - Bill Thompson on More Two Cultures
    - Open Data Institute, what, you and why.
    - Making your ideas actually happen
    - all the below
    - whatever you offer...


What other topics do we hope to cover?
    - Privacy and Digital Human Rights
    - Building on Science and Communication
    - Community engagement
    - Open Source, Open Hardware, Open*
    - Hacking UK Technology: policy & process
	- Government with a Digital Service
	- The Law: Making it
	- The Law: The other thing
    - Long term thinking on big problems and massive opportunities
    - Beyond Shoreditch: Diversity and Inclusion
    - Design
    - Tutorials & Workshops - share what you know
    - If you've got an interesting proposal that doesn't
      fit into any of the categories above, please send it
      in anyway!

What have we already got talks about? (we'll take more)
   - mySociety
   - Open Data, Institutionalised
   - Law and Legislation
   - NHS Hackday
   - FrontlineSMS
   - 3D printing
   - Making
   - Privacy
   - Law
   - Writing
   - Technology and Development

*How do I submit an idea?*
    - Online form via
      http://www.opentech.org.uk/2013/offer
	- If you have questions, email opentech at ukuug.org
    - Deadline for submissions is midnight on 1st April. No joke.
*Can I buy or reserve a ticket to the event?*

Ticket reservations will open in February.

owner of the data to choose actually how his/her personal data are going to
be shared and under which terms. Obviously this is not something trivial to
do, but hey, we are discussing here about how we could address this
problem, right?

<div dir=3D"ltr"><div><div><div>Hi there,<br><br></div>So I guess the quest=
ion here is how do we allow to open data sets to have different degrees of =
privacy. This is quite similar to the Creative Commons licenses where some =
people do like them because you have different levels of freedom to choose =
how do you want to share your data and under which conditions. <br>

<br></div>Thus, it may be interesting to create a set of open data licenses=
 that will have different levels of privacy accordingly, so the in case of =
patients they will actually choose how much do they want to share and how, =
even specifying if the data could be used for commercial benefits as it hap=
pens with the Creative Commons licenses, as some people will be fine with t=
hat, while other people will be completely against this commercial option.<=
br>

<br></div><div>From my point of view, in regards of personal data, it shoul=
d be up to the owner of the data to choose actually how his/her personal da=
ta are going to be shared and under which terms. Obviously this is not some=
thing trivial to do, but hey, we are discussing here about how we could add=
ress this problem, right?<br>

In some ways we have been conducting a society-wide experiment with less pr=
ivacy, and there are indications that the heady early days of free personal=
 sharing online without a care in the world are past their peak. Sharing ev=
erything with your friends on Facebook is a very different matter from when=
 employers and parents are checking your status updates.<br>


<br>
Confidentiality is considered an essential matter of ethics for a number of=
 professions, and for good reasons.<br>
<br>
The American Medical Association&#39;s page on confidentiality explains why=
:<br>
<br>
&quot;the purpose of a physician&#39;s ethical duty to maintain patient con=
fidentiality is to allow the patient to feel free to make a full and frank =
disclosure of information to the physician with the knowledge that the phys=
ician will protect the confidential nature of the information disclosed. Fu=
ll disclosure enables the physician to diagnose conditions properly and to =
treat the patient appropriately.&quot; from:<br>


<a href=3D"http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal-topics=
/patient-physician-relationship-topics/patient-confidentiality.page" target=
=3D"_blank">http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/<u></u>pub/physician-resources/lega=
l-<u></u>topics/patient-physician-<u></u>relationship-topics/patient-<u></u=
>confidentiality.page</a><br>


<br>
Knowing that confidentiality is a matter of ethics for the doctor is often =
important for people to seek treatment in the first place. This affects all=
 of us, because medical conditions often affect other people besides the pa=
tient.<br>


<br>
Librarians have similar ethical obligations to maintain confidentiality, fo=
r similar reasons. It is important that people trust us enough to seek help=
 finding answers to questions that they do not want to make public.<br>


<br>
The requirement for confidentiality is the responsibility of the profession=
al, not an obligation for the client. If a doctor diagnoses cancer, the doc=
tor has a duty to keep this information confidential, while the patient is =
free to create a public blog to talk about their experience of being diagno=
sed with cancer. The fact that some people choose some level of publicness =
(some patients may choose a more semi-public route like joining a support g=
roup where they identify may be unknown, or known only to group members), d=
oes not mean that others will make a similar choice, and does not diminish =
in any way our obligations to respect privacy.<br>


<br>
What does this mean for open data? If data cannot be properly anonymized, t=
hen some kinds of data cannot be completely open. However, there are degree=
s of open, such as open access to data for medical research purposes availa=
ble to anyone at an appropriately accredited medical research organization =
who has completed a recognized ethics review.<br>
