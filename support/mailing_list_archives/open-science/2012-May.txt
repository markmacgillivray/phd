Message-ID: <20120518075850.GA18221@yersinia>

Hi everyone,

I was asked to make potential candidates aware of an open position at
EMBO and hope nobody mind that I am posting this here. In my opinion
it is great that EMBO is starting such a project for its journals.

"EMBO is looking for a Scientific Data Editor to develop and implement
the digitalization of the scientific data and metadata associated with
figures published in The EMBO Journal, EMBO reports, Molecular Systems
Biology and EMBO Molecular Medicine. This task will involve the
annotation and curation of figures and datasets submitted by authors
using structured, machine-readable information.

The Scientific Data Editor will be part of the EMBO SourceData
project, which will make published data freely available to the
scientific community in a searchable and re-usable form. [...]"

Greetings Open Scientists,

We are trying to start Open Science working group in Switzerland.
This is driven by enthusiasts from the local Open Data
movement<http://make.opendata.ch/>(
opendata.ch) and couple of academic researchers working in life science &
IT domains.
First meeting is currently planned for the 2nd of June during the Random
Hacks of Kindness<http://rhokch.blogspot.com/2012/05/save-date-on-23-june-2012-rhok.html>event
in Bern.
If you're in Switzerland &/or are interested in joining the working group -
please get in touch! =)

Please see the message from Cameron Neylon, Director of Advocacy at
PLoS, below. Note that anyone around the world can participate by
signing (not just another e-petition, but has guaranteed legislative
effect), and by sharing with others by blogging, tweeting, emailing,
putting a link up on your site or wiki, or otherwise getting the word
out to as many stakeholders as possible.  You don't need to be a
resident of the US. The link to use is: http://wh.gov/6TH

Thanks so much for your help. We need you to do what you can to make
open access to research a reality.

Subject: Whitehouse Open Access petition kicking off Monday

Dear All

I wouldn't normally send out a bulk email but there is a big
opportunity coming up to make real progress on expanding Open Access
to US Federally Funded Research and in turn to use that momentum to
move the agenda forward in the rest of the world.

There is a real possibility of action in the US but to achieve this we
need to demonstrate wide public support through a petition on the
Whitehouse website. The petition will go live sometime on Sunday but
we are aiming for a big publicity push to draw attention to it on
Monday. ?The Whitehouse makes a formal response to these "We the
People" petitions if they reach 25k signatures within 30 days. Ideally
we'd like to go way through that number and as fast as possible to
demonstrate the diversity and depth of support.

Anything you are willing and able to do in terms of blogging,
tweeting, emailing or otherwise activating the networks of people you
are coupled into, particularly in the US, will make a difference. Our
aim is to hit the social media channels mid-late morning in Europe on
Monday and then to build momentum as the sun rises across the US. Feel
free to forward the information on to people interested and advise
people that the aim is to keep the powder dry until Monday morning.

There is more detail below but any questions feel free to ping me. I
will send the URL for the petition as soon as I have it but the
overall site address is:

https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions

Cheers

Cameron



1. Petition Text (800 character limit)

WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO:

Require free, timely access over the Internet to journal articles
arising from taxpayer-funded research.

We believe in the power of the Internet to foster innovation,
research, and education. ?Requiring the published results of
taxpayer-funded research to be posted on the Internet in human and
machine readable form would provide access to patients and caregivers,
students and their teachers, researchers, entrepreneurs, and other
taxpayers who paid for the research. Expanding access would speed the
research process and increase the return on our investment in
scientific research.

The highly successful Public Access Policy of the National Institutes
of Health proves that this can be done without disrupting the research
process, and we urge President Obama to act now to implement open
access policies for all federal agencies that fund scientific
research.

2. The Ask to Others

To sign the petition:

- ?????????????Have to be 13 years or older
- ?????????????Have to create an account on whitehouse.gov,
https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions
- ?????????????This first requires giving a name and an email address
and then clicking the validation link sent to that address
- ?????????????Click to sign the petition

3. Further Context

After years of work on promoting policy change to make
federally-funded research available on the Internet, and after winning
the battle to implement a public access policy at NIH, it has become
clear that being on the right side of the issue is necessary but not
sufficient. We've had the meetings, done the hearings, replied to the
requests for information.

But we're opposed in our work by a small set of publishers who profit
enormously from the existing system, even though there is no evidence
that the NIH policy has had any measurable impact on their business
models. They can - and do - outspend those of us who have chosen to
make a huge part of our daily work the expansion of access to
knowledge. This puts the idea of access at a disadvantage. We know
there is a serious debate about the extension of public access to
taxpayer funded research going on right now in the White House, but we
also know that we need more than our current ?approaches to get that
extension made into federal policy.

The best approach that we have yet to try is to make a broad public
appeal for support, straight to the people. The Obama Administration
has created a web platform to petition the White House directly called
We The People. Any petition receiving more than 25,000 digital
signatures is placed on the desk of the President's Chief of Staff and
must be integrated into policy and political discussions. But there's
a catch - a petition only has 30 days to gather the required number of
signatures to qualify.

We can get 25,000 signatures. And if we not only get 25,000, but an
order of magnitude more, we can change the debate happening right now.

Next week we will publish our petition and the 30 day cycle begins.
What we're asking you to do is to leverage your personal and
professional networks to get the word out.

You can do this in any way that makes you feel comfortable. A blog
post, an email to constituencies, a tweet, a facebook share, you name
it - ?something that tells thousands of people "I support this
petition, I'm signing this petition, and I thought you should know
about it too." Because this isn't just slacktivism with a "like" or a
retweet - people need to go to the White House website, enter their
name and email address, and hit the button.

Qualified signers must be 13 years old or more, and have a valid email
address. That's all.

The goal is not just to get 25,000, but to get far more to show the
White House that this issue matters to people, not just a few
publishers.

We are launching the campaign on Monday May 21. The petition will go
live late Sunday night May 20, so that the waves can start in the EU
and sweep west with the sunrise. We're asking you to turn on your
networks on Monday morning.

Thanks for considering this. If we can all come together to get the
word out at once, and stay behind it for 30 days, we have a real
chance to get access to taxpayer funded research across the entire
government, and send a signal that the people have a voice in this
debate, not just publishers and activists.

Message-ID: <CABPM+woSvYc=yKD56O3-RThpggdKwOAca6bsVrroVu3NP2iSgA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear open-science

Following on from William Gunn's message earlier, please see a message from
John Wilbanks and the access2research team below - they are aiming to
generate a big splash this Monday and you may have got an inkling of what
was coming through #OAMonday tweets, but it's arrived and they need your
help!

This message contains more info on social media links and handles than the
earlier one so do use them if you can and get the word out there.

Best wishes

Jenny

--------------------------------------------------------------

On *Monday, May 21*, we lodge a petition on the White House?s ?We the
People? page asking the Obama administration to require that all federally
funded research be posted on the Web ? extending the principle of the NIH
policy to all federal agencies.

1. What We?re Asking

? Publicity/ Call for Participation.  Please help line up publicity for the
petition before Monday.  Specifically, can you help get it on the front
pages of Reddit, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Boing Boing, and send out an
all-hands-on-deck request through your own blogs/twitter feeds, etc?

? 25,000 signatures in 30 days gets an official Administration response.
 We want to hit that number fast to escalate this issue inside the White
House.  We believe the policy has support but is stuck.  This could well be
the event that gets it through.

? Please sign the petition on Monday.

2. Social Media links/handles

The official campaign website is at http://access2research.org and there
are already Facebook pages
(http://facebook.com/**access2research<http://facebook.com/access2research>)
and Twitter handles (@access2research) in place.

3. Petition Text (800 character limit)

WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO: [This doesn't count toward the
character count]

Require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from
taxpayer-funded research.

We believe in the power of the Internet to foster innovation, research, and
education. Requiring the published results of taxpayer-funded research to
be posted on the Internet would give access to entrepreneurs, researchers,
patients, caregivers, and students, who currently are blocked by high
costs. We know this works without disturbing the process of scientific
publishing because the National Institutes of Health is already doing it
through its highly successful Public Access Policy. All other federal
agencies that fund research should have similar policies.

President Obama, please act now to make federally-funded research freely
available to taxpayers on the Internet.

4. The Ask to Others

To sign the petition:

-   Have to be 13 years or older
-   Have to create an account on whitehouse.gov, which requires giving a
name and an email address and then clicking the validation link sent to
that address
-   Click to sign

Hi Yaroslav

This sounds fantastic, do let us know how it goes!

For anyone considering starting a local group, OKFN can help out by setting
up mailing lists and a blog on the network as well as listing groups on
science.okfn.org, so do get in touch if you'd like any of those things.
We'd very much like to encourage and support local groups however we can.

Egon Willighagen has founded two groups local groups now and I'm running
one in Oxford so if you want to bounce ideas around we'd love to hear them.

Best of luck for 2 June :)

Hi all,

Please see below for an update from Kat Braybrooke on the progress of
OKFest.

Thanks to all who helped us to put together our OKFest submission. We have
been partnered with the Open Education folk, and will be participating in
OKFest as part of the 'Open Research and Education' stream. This should be
great, and there are many exciting opportunities for collaboration.

The 'Guest Programming Planners' (those of us who signed up on the etherpad
to help organise the stream!) will be meeting next Tuesday to discuss how
best to move things forward. We will keep you all in the loop as plans
develop :)

If you have any questions or suggestions in the meantime, drop me a line
and we'll make sure your voice gets heard! Equally if anyone would like to
join the Planning Committee, do let me know.

All the best,
Laura

Hello all,

Kat Braybrooke here from the OKFestival 2012 Core Organising Team with a
message of congratulations - we were highly impressed by your topic
submissions in the 1st Call for Proposals and would like you to be a part
of the festival's organising team!

As many of you have already seen, we have now confirmed the 13 key Topic
Streams of 2012, one of which is *Open Education and Access*. As the Lead
for this topic, I therefore ask if you are willing to come together to be
its Guest Programming Planners <details: http://bit.ly/guest_planner_**
instructions <http://bit.ly/guest_planner_instructions>>.

Our reasoning behind the combining of these concepts is based on the high
quality of submissions we've received related to open access, science,
academia and research - and the fact that we believe much of your
already-impressive work will be made even more enriched by collaborating
around these ideas and finding both commonalities and uniqueness through
this process. Your backgrounds include the Open Knowledge Foundation,
Cambridge University, University of Southampton, Aalto University and other
Finnish educational institutes, Creative Commons - and you have proposed
programme elements related to Open Design, Open Access, Open Data Research,
and Open Education (see Etherpad below for details). I believe there's much
that can happen with such a venerable group.

I've booted up an Etherpad with all of your proposals so everyone can see
everyone else's work, and start discussing best ways to collaborate:
http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/OpenResearchAndEducation I'd also recommend
that we get a Facebook group started as the Open Democracy and Citizen
Movement Topic Stream has just done <see here:
https://www.facebook.com/groups/opendemocracy.okfest/>, so we can start
introducing ourselves to each other and bring new participants in.

The next steps are:

01) We'll need a confirmation ASAP that you're willing to work together as
Guest Programme Planners for this stream. If so, please send us the names
of 1-3 leaders who serve as public representatives and help with the
coordination of this group.

02) Please also read through our Guest Programme Planner handbook and let
me know if you have any questions: http://bit.ly/guest_planner_**
instructions <http://bit.ly/guest_planner_instructions>

03) Lastly, we will be publishing the last Call for Proposals on Monday, so
it would be great to see activity from your organisers on the Public
OKFestival Wiki by the end of next week, to be of use to those who plan to
submit sessions. We're especially looking for a description of who you'd
like to join your team (hackers, teachers, people from universities, etc):
http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/helsinki

Please reply to the whole group so we can start this discussion. I look
forward to it!

Subject: [open-science] access2research - just over 5000 signatures to go
Message-ID: <CABPM+wrdeA_1HsXAbnx_VG_w1OO_6EmOPhXC+BQdEhXQdPQnCw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Many of you will have already heard of the http://access2research.org petition
to encourage the White House to consider further opening up of access to
scientific publications.

https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions/!/petition/require-free-access-over-internet-scientific-journal-articles-arising-taxpayer-funded-research/wDX82FLQ

This is endorsed by the OKFN
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/05/21/petition-the-white-house-to-open-up-publicly-funded-research/
and
it would be fantastic to see as many of our supporters as possible signing
and encouraging others to do the same - they are edging towards the 20,000
mark and require just over 5,000 more signatures by June 19 to guarantee a
response from the administration.

You do not need to be American, just over the age of 13 with an easily
created whitehouse.gov account.

Many more details below for those willing to spread the word around their
social networks and thanks very much to those who already have!

Jenny

--------------------------------------------------------------

On *Monday, May 21*, we lodge a petition on the White House?s ?We the
People? page asking the Obama administration to require that all federally
funded research be posted on the Web ? extending the principle of the NIH
policy to all federal agencies.

1. What We?re Asking

? Publicity/ Call for Participation.  Please help line up publicity for the
petition before Monday.  Specifically, can you help get it on the front
pages of Reddit, Tumblr, Wikipedia, Boing Boing, and send out an
all-hands-on-deck request through your own blogs/twitter feeds, etc?

? 25,000 signatures in 30 days gets an official Administration response.
 We want to hit that number fast to escalate this issue inside the White
House.  We believe the policy has support but is stuck.  This could well be
the event that gets it through.

? Please sign the petition on Monday.

2. Social Media links/handles

The official campaign website is at http://access2research.org and there
are already Facebook pages
(http://facebook.com/**access2research<http://facebook.com/access2research>)
and Twitter handles (@access2research) in place.

3. Petition Text (800 character limit)

WE PETITION THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TO: [This doesn't count toward the
character count]

Require free access over the Internet to journal articles arising from
taxpayer-funded research.

We believe in the power of the Internet to foster innovation, research, and
education. Requiring the published results of taxpayer-funded research to
be posted on the Internet would give access to entrepreneurs, researchers,
patients, caregivers, and students, who currently are blocked by high
costs. We know this works without disturbing the process of scientific
publishing because the National Institutes of Health is already doing it
through its highly successful Public Access Policy. All other federal
agencies that fund research should have similar policies.

President Obama, please act now to make federally-funded research freely
available to taxpayers on the Internet.

4. The Ask to Others

To sign the petition:

-   Have to be 13 years or older
-   Have to create an account on whitehouse.gov, which requires giving a
name and an email address and then clicking the validation link sent to
that address
-   Click to sign

5. Further Context

After years of work on promoting policy change to make federally-funded
research available on the Internet, and after winning the battle to
implement a public access policy at NIH, it has become clear that being on
the right side of the issue is necessary but not sufficient. We've had the
meetings, done the hearings, replied to the requests for information.

But we're opposed in our work by a small set of publishers who profit
enormously from the existing system, even though there is no evidence that
the NIH policy has had any measurable impact on their business models. They
can - and do - outspend those of us who have chosen to make a huge part of
our daily work the expansion of access to knowledge. This puts the idea of
access at a disadvantage. We know there is a serious debate about the
extension of public access to taxpayer funded research going on right now
in the White House, but we also know that we need more than our current
 approaches to get that extension made into federal policy.

The best approach that we have yet to try is to make a broad public appeal
for support, straight to the people. The Obama Administration has created a
web platform to petition the White House directly called We The People. Any
petition receiving more than 25,000 digital signatures is placed on the
desk of the President's Chief of Staff and must be integrated into policy
and political discussions. But there's a catch - a petition only has 30
days to gather the required number of signatures to qualify.

We can get 25,000 signatures. And if we not only get 25,000, but an order
of magnitude more, we can change the debate happening right now.

Next week we will publish our petition and the 30 day cycle begins. What
we're asking you to do is to leverage your personal and professional
networks to get the word out.

You can do this in any way that makes you feel comfortable. A blog post, an
email to constituencies, a tweet, a facebook share, you name it - something
that tells thousands of people "I support this petition, I'm signing this
petition, and I thought you should know about it too." Because this isn't
just slacktivism with a "like" or a retweet - people need to go to the
White House website, enter their name and email address, and hit the button.

Qualified signers must be 13 years old or more, and have a valid email
address. That's all.

The goal is not just to get 25,000, but to get far more to show the White
House that this issue matters to people, not just a few publishers.

We are launching the campaign on Monday May 21. The petition will go live
late Sunday night May 20, so that the waves can start in the EU and sweep
west with the sunrise. We're asking you to turn on your networks on Monday
morning.

Thanks for considering this. If we can all come together to get the word
out at once, and stay behind it for 30 days, we have a real chance to get
access to taxpayer funded research across the entire government, and send a
signal that the people have a voice in this debate, not just publishers and
activists.
