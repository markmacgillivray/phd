==== Call for Challenge: Linked Open Data-enabled Recommender Systems ====

Challenge Website: http://challenges.2014.eswc-conferences.org/RecSys
Call Web page: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-RecSys

MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES
People generally need more and more advanced tools that go beyond those implementing the canonical search paradigm for seeking relevant information. A new search paradigm is emerging, where the user perspective is completely reversed: from finding to being found. Recommender systems may help to support this new perspective, because they have the effect of pushing relevant objects, selected from a large space of possible options, to potentially interested users. To achieve this result, recommendation techniques generally rely on data referring to three kinds of objects: users, items and their relations.
Recent developments in the Semantic Web community offer novel strategies to represent data about users, items and their relations that might improve the current state of the art of recommender systems, in order to move towards a new generation of recommender systems which fully understand the items they deal with.
More and more semantic data are published following the Linked Data principles, that enable to set up links between objects in different data sources, by connecting information in a single global data space: the Web of Data. Today, the Web of Data includes different types of knowledge represented in a homogeneous form: sedimentary one (encyclopedic, cultural, linguistic, common-sense) and real-time one (news, data streams, ...). These data might be useful to interlink diverse information about users, items, and their relations and implement reasoning mechanisms that can support and improve the recommendation process.
The primary goal of this challenge is twofold. On the one hand, we want to create a link between the Semantic Web and the Recommender Systems communities. On the other hand, we aim to show how Linked Open Data and semantic technologies can boost the creation of a new breed of knowledge-enabled and content-based recommender systems.

TARGET AUDIENCE
The target audience is all of those communities, both academic and industrial, which are interested in personalized information access with a particular emphasis on Linked Open Data.
During the last ACM RecSys conference more than 60% of participants were from industry. This is for sure a witness of the actual interest of recommender systems for industrial applications ready to be released in the market.

TASKS
Task 1: Rating prediction in cold-start situations
This task deals with the rating prediction problem, in which a system is requested to estimate the value of unknown numeric scores (a.k.a. ratings) that a target user would assign to available items, indicating whether she likes or dislikes them.
In order to favor the proposal of content-based, LOD-enabled recommendation approaches, and limit the use of collaborative filtering approaches, this task aims at predicting ratings in cold-start situations, that is, predicting ratings for users who have a few past ratings, and predicting ratings of items that have been rated by a few users.
The dataset to use in the task - DBbook - relates to the book domain. It contains explicit numeric ratings assigned by users to books. For each book we provide the corresponding DBpedia URI.
Participants will have to exploit the provided ratings as training sets, and will have to estimate unknown ratings in a non-provided evaluation set.
Recommendation approaches will be evaluated on the evaluation set by means of metrics that measure the differences between real and estimated ratings, namely the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).

Task 2: Top-N recommendation from binary user feedback
This task deals with the top-N recommendation problem, in which a system is requested to find and recommend a limited set of N items that best match a user profile, instead of correctly predict the ratings for all available items.
Similarly to Task 1, in order to favor the proposal of content-based, LOD-enabled recommendation approaches, and limit the use of collaborative filtering approaches, this task aims at generating ranked lists of items for which no graded ratings are available, but only binary ones.
Also in this case, the DBbook dataset will be provided.
In this task, the accuracy of recommendation approaches will be evaluated on an evaluation set using the F-measure.

Task 3: Diversity
A very interesting aspect of content-based recommender systems and then of LOD-enabled ones is giving the possibility to evaluate the diversity of recommended items in a straight way. This is a very popular topic in content-based recommender systems, which usually suffer from over-specialization.
In this task, the evaluation will be made by considering a combination of both accuracy of the recommendation list and the diversity of items belonging to it. Also for this task, DBbook dataset will be used.
Given the domain of books, diversity with respect to the two properties dbpedia-owl:author and skos:subject will be considered.

EVALUATION DATASET AND EVALUATION METRICS
DBbook dataset
This dataset relies on user data and preferences retrieved from the Web. The books available in the dataset have been mapped to their corresponding DBpedia URIs. The mapping contains 8170 DBpedia URIs.
These mappings can be used to extract semantic features from DBpedia or other LOD repositories to be exploited by the recommendation approaches proposed in the challenge.
The dataset is split in a training set and an evaluation set. In the former, user ratings are provided to train a system while in the latter, ratings have been removed, and they will be used in the eventual evaluation step.

Participants will generate the ratings (Task 1) or the ranking (Task 2 and Task 3) for the test set, and their results will be compared and evaluated with respect to actual users ratings (hidden evaluation data).

The two sets will be provided at the challenge's website, in the following plain text files:
* lodrecsys2014-DBbook-training-ratings.txt: Contains tuples <user, book, rating> that may be used to build the recommendation approaches. 
* lodrecsys2014-DBbook-test-ratings.txt: Contains tuples <user, book> that will be used to evaluate the recommendation approaches. 

Together with the two previous files, a further one will be provided containing the mapping to DBpedia.
* lodrecsys2014-DBbook-mappings.txt: Contains tuples <book, bookURI> associated with the books in DBbook that will be used to extract and exploit semantic features from DBpedia and other LOD repositories.

Recommendation approaches will be evaluated with the metrics requested in each task. We provide a number of Java classes that compute the different metrics and a Web Service to test intermediate results. A description of the metrics to compute and further details regarding the evaluation will be available at the challenge website.

==== Call for Challenge: Semantic Publishing ====

Challenge Website: http://challenges.2014.eswc-conferences.org/SemPub
Call Web page: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-SemPub

MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES
Scholarly publishing is increasingly enabling a new wave of applications that better support researchers in disseminating, exploiting and evaluating their results. The potential of publishing scientific papers enriched with semantic information is huge and raises interesting and challenging issues. Semantic Web technologies play a central role in this context, as they can help publishers to make scientific results available in an open format the whole research community can benefit from.
The Semantic Publishing Challenge 2014 is intended to be the first in a series of events at ESWC for producing and exploiting semantic publishing data. The main focus this year is on extracting information and using this information to assess the quality of scientific productions.
Linked open datasets about scientific production exist - e.g. DBLP - but they usually cover basic bibliographic information, which is not sufficient to assess quality. Quality-related information, such as the number of journal articles that cite a given publication, or the number of times a workshop has been run by the same chairs and received many submissions, or the actual function of a citation are often hidden and not yet available as LOD. The main goal of the Challenge is to build high-quality LOD that contains such information.
Moving off this year's outcomes, we plan to investigate the final publication and exploitation side in the next editions.

TARGET AUDIENCE
The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia.

TASKS
We ask challengers to automatically annotate a set of multi-format and multi-source input documents and to produce a Linked Open Dataset that fully describes these documents, their context, and relevant parts of their content. The evaluation will consist of evaluating a set of queries against the produced dataset to assess its correctness and completeness.
The input dataset will be split in two parts: a training/testing part and an evaluation part, which will disclosed a few days before the submission deadline. Participants will be asked to run their tool on the evaluation dataset and to produce the final Linked Open Dataset.
Further details about the organization of the Challenge will be provided. The Challenge will include two tasks:

Task 1: Extraction and assessment of workshop proceedings information
Participants are required to extract information from a set of HTML tables of contents, partly including microformat and RDFa annotations but not necessarily being valid HTML, of selected computer science workshop proceedings published with the CEUR-WS.org open access service. The extracted information is expected to answer queries about the quality of these workshops, for instance by measuring their growth, longevity, connection with other events, distribution of papers and authors.

Task 2: Extraction and characterization of citations
Participants are required to extract information about the citations in scientific journals and their relevance. Input documents are in XML JATS and TaxPub, an official extension of JATS customized for taxonomic treatments, and selected from the PubMedCentral Open Access Subset and the Pensoft Biodiversity Data Journal and ZooKeys archive. The extracted information is expected to be used for assessing the value of citations, for instance by considering their position in the paper, their co-location with other citations or their purpose.

EVALUATION
Participants will be requested to submit the LOD that their tool produces from the evaluation dataset, as well as a paper that describes their approach. They will also be given a set of queries in natural language form and will be asked to translate those queries into a SPARQL form that works on their LOD.
The results of the queries on the produced LOD will be compared with the expected output, and precision and recall will be measured to identify the best performing approach. Separately, the most original approach will be assigned by the Program Committee.
Further details about the evaluation will be provided on the challenge wiki.

FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSION
A discussion group is open for participants to ask questions and to receive updates about the challenge (see link at bottom). Participants are invited to subscribe to this group as soon as possible and to communicate their intention to participate. They are also invited to use this channel to discuss problems in the input dataset and to suggest changes.

JUDGING AND PRIZES
After a first round of review, the Program Committee and the chairs will select a number of submissions conforming to the challenge requirements that will be invited to present their work. Submissions accepted for presentation will receive constructive reviews from the Program Committee, they will be included in the Springer LNCS post-proceedings of ESWC, and they will have a presentation slot in a poster session dedicated to the challenge. 

In addition, the winners will present their work in a special slot of the main program of ESWC and will be invited to submit a revised and extended paper to a dedicated Semantic Web Journal special issue.

Four winners will be selected. For each of the two tasks we will select:
* best performing tool, given to the paper which will get the highest score in the evaluation
* most original approach, selected by the Challenge Committee with the reviewing process

HOW TO PARTICIPATE
Participants are required to submit:
* Abstract: no more than 200 words.
* Description: It should explain the details of the automated annotation system, including why the system is innovative, how it uses Semantic Web technology, what features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned. The description should also summarize how participants have addressed the evaluation tasks. An outlook towards how the data could be consumed is appreciated but not strictly required. Papers must be submitted in PDF format, following the style of the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors), and not exceeding 5 pages in length.
* The Linked Open Dataset produced by their tool on the evaluation dataset (as a file or as a URL, in Turtle or RDF/XML). 
* A set of SPARQL queries that work on that LOD and correspond to the natural language queries provided as input

Participants will also be asked to submit their tool (source and/or binaries, or a link these can be downloaded from, or a web service URL) for verification purposes.
Further submission instructions will be published on the challenge wiki.

All submissions should be provided via EasyChair https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014-challenges

==== Call for Challenge: Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis ====

Challenge Website: http://challenges.2014.eswc-conferences.org/SemSA
Call Web page: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-SemSATarg
					
MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES
Mining opinions and sentiments from natural language is an extremely difficult task as it involves a deep understanding of most of the explicit and implicit, regular and irregular, syntactical and semantic rules proper of a language. Existing approaches mainly rely on parts of text in which opinions and sentiments are explicitly expressed such as polarity terms, affect words and their co-occurrence frequencies. However, opinions and sentiments are often conveyed implicitly through latent semantics, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that allow a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data, in potentially any domain.

Concept-level sentiment analysis focuses on a semantic analysis of text through the use of web ontologies or semantic networks, which allow the aggregation of conceptual and affective information associated with natural language opinions. By relying on large semantic knowledge bases, concept-level sentiment analysis steps away from blind use of keywords and word co-occurrence count, but rather relies on the implicit features associated with natural language concepts.

This Challenge focuses on the introduction, presentation, and discussion of novel approaches to concept-level sentiment analysis. Participants will have to design a concept-level opinion-mining engine that exploits common-sense knowledge bases, e.g., SenticNet, and/or Linked Data and Semantic Web ontologies, e.g., DBPedia, to perform multi-domain sentiment analysis. The main motivation for the Challenge, in particular, is to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of natural language text and provide novel concept-level tools and techniques that allow a more efficient passage from (unstructured) natural language to (structured) machine-processable data, in potentially any domain.

Systems must have a semantics flavor (e.g., by making use of Linked Data or known semantic networks within their core functionalities) and authors need to show how the introduction of semantics can be used to obtain valuable information, functionality or performance. Existing natural language processing methods or statistical approaches can be used too as long as the semantics plays a main role within the core approach (engines based merely on syntax/word-count will be excluded from the competition).


TARGET AUDIENCE
The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia.

TASKS
The Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge is defined in terms of different tasks. The first task is elementary whereas the others are more advanced. The input units of each task are sentences. Sentences are assumed to be in grammatically correct American English and have to be processed according to the input format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/sentence.

Elementary Task: Polarity Detection
The main goal of the task is polarity detection. The proposed systems will be assessed according to precision, recall and F-measure of detected binary polarity values (1=positive; 0=negative) for each input sentence of the evaluation dataset, following the same format as in http://sentic.net/challenge/task0. The problem of subjectivity detection is not addressed within this Challenge, hence participants can assume that there will be no neutral sentences. Participants are encouraged to use the Sentic API or further develop and apply sentic computing tools.

Advanced Task #1: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
The output of this task will be a set of aspects of the reviewed product and a binary polarity value associated to each of such aspects, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task1. So, for example, while for the Elementary task an overall polarity (positive or negative) is expected for a review about a mobile phone, this task requires a set of aspects (such as ???speaker', ???touchscreen', ???camera', etc.) and a polarity value (positive OR negative) associated with each of such aspects. Systems will be assessed according to both aspect extraction and aspect polarity detection.

Advanced Task #2: Semantic Parsing
As suggested by the title, the Challenge focuses on sentiment analysis at concept-level. This means that the proposed systems are not supposed to work at word/syntax level but rather work with concepts/semantics. Hence, this task will evaluate the capability of the proposed systems to deconstruct natural language text into concepts, following the same format as in http://sentic.net/challenge/task2. SenticNet will be taken as a reference to test the efficiency of the proposed parsers, but extracted concepts won't necessary have to match SenticNet concepts. The proposed systems, for example, are supposed to be able to extract a multi-word expression like ???buy christmas present' from sentences such as ???Today I bought a lot of very nice Christmas presents'. The number of extracted concepts per sentence will be assessed through precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.

Advanced Task #3: Topic Spotting
Input sentences will be about four different domains, namely: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances. This task focuses on the automatic classification of sentences into one of such domains, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task3. All sentences are assumed to belong to only one of the above-mentioned domains. The proposed systems are supposed to exploit the extracted concepts to infer which domain each sentence belongs to. Classification accuracy will be evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.

EVALUATION DATASET
Systems will be evaluated against a testing dataset which will be revealed and released after the first-round of evaluation during the Conference. The dataset will be made public on the challenge website. Participants are suggested to train and/or test their own systems using the Blitzer Dataset. The testing dataset will be constructed in the same way and from the same sources as the Blitzer dataset.

EVALUATION
The evaluation will be performed by the members of the Program Committee. For systems that can be tuned with different parameters, please indicate a range of up to 4 sets of settings. Settings with the best F-measures will be considered for judgment. For each system, reviewers will give a numerical score within the range [1-10] and details motivating their choice. The scores will be given to the following aspects:
1. Use of common-sense knowledge and semantics;
2. Precision, recall, and F-measure wrt the selected task;
3. Computational time;
4. Innovative nature of the approach.

JUDGING AND PRIZES
After a first round of review, the Program Committee and the chairs will select a number of submissions confirming to the challenge requirements that will be invited to present their work. Submissions accepted for presentation will be included in post-proceedings and will receive constructive reviews from the Program Committee. All accepted submissions will have a slot in a poster session dedicated to the challenge. In addition, the winners will present their work in a special slot of the main program of ESWC and will be invited to submit a paper to a dedicated Semantic Web Journal special issue.

For the Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge there will be two awards for each task:
* Quantitative: the system with the highest average score in items 1-3 above;
* Innovative: the system with the highest score in item 4 above.
There will be a board of judges at the conference who will evaluate again the systems in more detail. The judges will then meet in private to discuss the entries and to determine the winners. It may happen that the same system runs for both the awards.


HOW TO PARTICIPATE
The following information has to be provided:
* Abstract: no more than 200 words.
* Description: It should contain the details of the system, including why the system is innovative, how it uses Semantic Web, which features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned. The description should also summarize how participants have addressed the evaluation tasks. Papers must be submitted in PDF format, following the style of the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors), and not exceeding 5 pages in length.
* Web Access: The application can either be accessible via the web or downloadable. If the application is not publicly accessible, password must be provided. A short set of instructions on how to use the application should be provided as well.

All submissions should be provided via EasyChair https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014-challenges

Please share comments and questions with the challenge mailing list. The organizers will assist you for any potential issues that could be raised.

So, for example, while for the Elementary task an overall polarity (positive or negative) is expected for a review about a mobile phone, this task requires a set of aspects (such as ???speaker', ???touchscreen', ???camera', etc.) and a polarity value (positive OR negative) associated with each of such aspects. Systems will be assessed according to both aspect extraction and aspect polarity detection.

Advanced Task #2: Semantic Parsing
As suggested by the title, the Challenge focuses on sentiment analysis at concept-level. This means that the proposed systems are not supposed to work at word/syntax level but rather work with concepts/semantics. Hence, this task will evaluate the capability of the proposed systems to deconstruct natural language text into concepts, following the same format as in http://sentic.net/challenge/task2. SenticNet will be taken as a reference to test the efficiency of the proposed parsers, but extracted concepts won't necessary have to match SenticNet concepts. The proposed systems, for example, are supposed to be able to extract a multi-word expression like ???buy christmas present' from sentences such as ???Today I bought a lot of very nice Christmas presents'. The number of extracted concepts per sentence will be assessed through precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.

Advanced Task #3: Topic Spotting
Input sentences will be about four different domains, namely: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances. This task focuses on the automatic classification of sentences into one of such domains, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task3. All sentences are assumed to belong to only one of the above-mentioned domains. The proposed systems are supposed to exploit the extracted concepts to infer which domain each sentence belongs to. Classification accuracy will be evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.

EVALUATION DATASET
Systems will be evaluated against a testing dataset which will be revealed and released after the first-round of evaluation during the Conference. The dataset will be made public on the challenge website. Participants are suggested to train and/or test their own systems using the Blitzer Dataset. The testing dataset will be constructed in the same way and from the same sources as the Blitzer dataset.

EVALUATION
The evaluation will be performed by the members of the Program Committee. For systems that can be tuned with different parameters, please indicate a range of up to 4 sets of settings. Settings with the best F-measures will be considered for judgment. For each system, reviewers will give a numerical score within the range [1-10] and details motivating their choice. The scores will be given to the following aspects:
1. Use of common-sense knowledge and semantics;
2. Precision, recall, and F-measure wrt the selected task;
3. Computational time;
4. Innovative nature of the approach.

JUDGING AND PRIZES
After a first round of review, the Program Committee and the chairs will select a number of submissions confirming to the challenge requirements that will be invited to present their work. Submissions accepted for presentation will be included in post-proceedings and will receive constructive reviews from the Program Committee. All accepted submissions will have a slot in a poster session dedicated to the challenge. In addition, the winners will present their work in a special slot of the main program of ESWC and will be invited to submit a paper to a dedicated Semantic Web Journal special issue.

For the Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge there will be two awards for each task:
* Quantitative: the system with the highest average score in items 1-3 above;
* Innovative: the system with the highest score in item 4 above.
There will be a board of judges at the conference who will evaluate again the systems in more detail. The judges will then meet in private to discuss the entries and to determine the winners. It may happen that the same system runs for both the awards.


HOW TO PARTICIPATE
The following information has to be provided:
* Abstract: no more than 200 words.
* Description: It should contain the details of the system, including why the system is innovative, how it uses Semantic Web, which features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned. The description should also summarize how participants have addressed the evaluation tasks. Papers must be submitted in PDF format, following the style of the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors), and not exceeding 5 pages in length.
* Web Access: The application can either be accessible via the web or downloadable. If the application is not publicly accessible, password must be provided. A short set of instructions on how to use the application should be provided as well.

All submissions should be provided via EasyChair https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014-challenges

Please share comments and questions with the challenge mailing list. The organizers will assist you for any potential issues that could be raised.

Hi all!

We'd like to get people's input on how the Open Knowledge Foundation can
better serve you. This community survey will take about 10 minutes to
complete:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1dCH7omEGGqhNq5JiBGdW-6sbFw6LKDlMS3Wa-1mfnCE/viewform

We'll close it off on December 13th and share the results in the new year.

The survey is in English, and we'd love to get it translated into other
languages - so please contact me off list if you can help with this.

Thanks a lot!
Michelle

I'd be interested to hear if there's been any effort put into how to
properly describe the function of a piece of code in a file like
BibJSON. For example, knowing that a piece of code was written in
Python, was for an astrophysics domain and performed coordinate
transformations. It feels like that could be encapsulated in some kind
of meta descriptor file which could then be indexed (and searched).

Has anyone seen anything like this done?

Cheers
Arfon

I'm very sympathetic to Arfon's request as I often forget what I wrote in
my own code 20 years ago.  My best guess is that full text indexing (I use
Javadoc)  is as valuable as trying to create keywords and microformats. I
am reduced to Googling for my own code on Git/Bitbucket.

The mathematicians have well defined bibliographic categories (e.g. PDEs)
and I'd recommend using them as they are widespread use. Not sure about
compsci. Names of algorithms are always useful so, for example I have
recently implemented / reused Zhang Suen Thinning, Otsu Binarization, Canny
edge Detection, Hough Transform algorithms for image processing and they
should be very discoverable by search engines if exposed.

I'd assume that the docs for a significant body of code would indicate the
language (Javadoc is distinctive).

http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com - with the additional benefit that
the descriptions are citable.

Great question. DOAP looks pretty promising.

In ecology we have our own XML-schema metadata standard for describing
software, whose vocabulary is pretty generic:
http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/eml-2.1.1/eml-software.html Not
RDF but the standard has been around for 10 years with reasonable adoption
in our discipline.  I assume other disciplines have similar creatures.

Of course language-specific repositories often have their own way of
representing software metadata.  For instance, R packages on CRAN specify
generic metadata such as project title, description, authors, version, url,
bug reports, etc, in a machine-readable querable plain text format, e.g.
http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/XML/  Certainly there are other
examples (cpan, etc).

Would be nice if everyone wrapped some semantics like DOAP around this to
make these things more universal.

Does JORS provide a machine-readable version of the metadata in their
descriptions?

JORS currently uses standard artice metadata. This is being enhanced at the
moment however as a new online editor for the papers is in the works (to be
released in January), which gives us a good opportunity to address the
metadata as well, and we'll definitely take a look at DOAP and other
examples to see how this could be improved.

Brian, thanks for clarifying.  I think a schema or semantic annotation of
the software descriptions published in JORS would be a great service to the
community.  Looking forward to seeing what you come up with,

- Carl

Agreed. Is this schema definition for JORS going to be discussed
publicly before implementation?

We'd be happy to do so, and it would of course also be extremely helpful.
I'll pass this on to the team and keep you up to date.

Message-ID: <CABPM+wq_oj72gZ9hfi4iEz9dqmq2-dqw1F5FUXd2tpxASGJZgA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

OKF have been invited to participate in Open Repositories 2014 in Helsinki,
Finland, 9-13 June 2014.

Are any of you already planning to attend and/or might be interested in
running a workshop?

The initial idea is a workshop looking at CKAN as a research data
repository but many of the themes fit with interests of working group
members so do feel free to suggest alternative topics or volunteer for this
one! Per the website http://or2014.helsinki.fi/?page_id=281, the conference
organisers are particularly interested in:


   - Unconventional approaches to repository-like services
   - Interconnection between publishers and repositories
   - Researcher-centered design for scholarly workflows
   - Adaptations to support curation lifecycle management, e.g., for
   research data
   - Real-world scalability and performance stories: working at web-scale,
   with big data for global usage
   - Requirements for holding restricted or classified data in repositories
   - Infrastructure to accommodate national and international mandates for
   data management and open access
   - Positioning repositories closer to (local, consortial, or cloud-based)
   cyberinfrastructure for data processing
   - Leveraging connections to external services including:
      - Remote identifier services (e.g., DOI, ORCID)
      - (Re-)using repository data/metadata in new and unexpected ways,
      including integrated discovery
      - Scholarly social media services, such as for annotation, review,
      comment, reputation, citation, and altmetrics
      - CRIS and research management systems
      - Digital preservation tools, services & infrastructure
   - Community and sustainability in an open world

What are your thoughts?

Jenny

I have just started using CKAN in this way and think it has potential. See
http://datahub.io/dataset/species-in-articles-from-biomedcentral/resource/ca3cfd1c-1239-49f0-8eeb-68d96d739d3a

I know some of the Open Repositories community - I think that we might get
a reasonable turn-out. We would not deliberately limit it to science but I
think science is easier to start off with. My personal interests would
include:

* problems of legacy data formats
* adding structure to semi-structured data
* indexing,particularly domain-specific information

I am interested and happy to work with others who want to present something

Potentially the Open Access Button team might be interested in this.

We'd like to make repositories a big part of the tool. We're currently
tossing around ideas (some concrete some not) around leveraging databases
like openDOAR (and the repositories indexed there) as a way to give our
users access to papers, and building in ways to promote researchers
depositing papers. One of our dev team is also wanting to create a way for
authors to submit open access versions of papers directly to us - which, if
it worked would almost create a repository-type system.

Thanks,

Joe

If you want an explicit guide to building a repository with DSpace
software, then try: http://bit.ly/goodir and http://bit.ly/garpir. No need
to re-invent the wheel.

Yes.

My personal feeling is that the current generation of repositories (V1?)
have concentrated on deposition and are very poor at discovery, indexing,
search, etc. Their motivation is often driven by University management
procedures (e.g. REF in UK) and not by use.

So I would love to see a user-facing repository - one that people outside
the University and its library *wanted* to use. I'd like to see this built
on present thinking (GitHub, Wikipedia, StackOverflow) not the repository
technologies in current use (EPrints, DSpace - I put 200000 objects in my
DSpace and can't get them out as the architecture doesn't allow it).

Also I'd love to see a repository which was independent of a given
institution. Part of the current problem is that every university feels it
has to have one, rather than having a few global approaches.

We have to be able to search it on our terms, so we have to develop our own
search technologies. That is why I am looking at CKAN as it has a lot of
users and many of them effectively pay for it. But it may be only a
learning exercise.

Yes. I have tried to get this idea across  to the conventional repository
community with little success. There should be only one (or at best a few)
entry points. I have suggested a repository for all UK funded Open output
including papers, theses and data. That in itself is technically too
limiting but it can catch the political imagination.(Some countries such as
NL (SURF) do this much better).

Yes. 1995 would have been the time to start - 2 years after the WWW took
off, when most of the web was open and based on public institutions. It's
also the time at which we should have seen innovative approaches to
publishing. Now we have to break free of the quagmire of academic
aspirations.

There is effectively no user-base for current repositories so there is no
pressure on developers to provide them. It's a cyclic argument.
Universities rely on G**gle (who are now teamed up with Th*ms*n - R**t*rs)
- do you trust this combination to provide what we really want?

It's shameful IMO that universities have spent (my estimate) 500 Million
USD on repositories [*] and they are basically unsearchable without G**gle.

P.

[*] 1500 research active universities (guess) * 2 FTEs (Peter Suber
estimated 1.5-5 FTEs) * 10 years =30,000 FTEs

I guess my estimate is low...

CKAN has its  own API so if there is a Java client I'll use that - I don't
think SWORD gives a technical advantage - it might give a political one.

Hi All

[Cc'ing the CKAN4RDM list this time!]

I've been in touch with Joss Winn and he isn't planning to attend the
conference, while it would be good to incorporate CKAN into the workshop to
demonstrate some potential uses, that doesn't need to be theme and was just
an initial suggestion. I mentioned to the Open Repositories team that we
have several working group members interested in search/indexing/mining as
well and said I would ask for suggestions.

People seem to be pointing towards:
1) Automatic/crowdsourced deposition of OA work into repositories via
OAButton system or other means (maybe we could persuade a few live
repositories to implement the deposit button Mark discussed).
2) Indexing content for search and discovery.
3) Bridging between where people publish code and data (e.g.
GitHub/BitBucket) and then how that's incorporated and referenced in the
literature (thanks Arfon for this suggestion!) How do repositories fit in?

I copy in Imma who is from the Open Repositories organising committee to
see if she has any feedback on the ideas so far and we can decide which one
might best make for a coherent workshop. From last year's programme these
are typically 3-4 hours. This document should also give a feel for the
kinds of sessions that were being run
http://or2013.net/program/session-schedule.

Hi All

Apologies for not following this up for a while. If anyone else is
interested in getting involved and wants to sign up, please do at
http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition

*So far :*

Michelle and Juan have offered to coordinate and Ross and Abby are keen to
take so I think we have enough people to go ahead!

Bjoern - I think at this stage a data expedition would be more finding out
what data we can get and then we can bring the economists on board so if
you would still be happy to help coordinate that would be fantastic!

It may end up being a somewhat futile exercise as we're dealing with
corporations and not public bodies so getting hold of account breakdowns
will be challenging.

As was pointed out to me the other day and I hadn't explicitly mentioned,
scholarly publishing is only a part of the activities of many of the major
publishers so splitting apart profit for journals, academic books and
monographs (let alone teasing those items apart) may simply be impossible
if the companies themselves won't supply us with the data. It would be
informative to see what is out there though and start compiling what we do
know.

*Next steps: *

   - If you would like to help in any capacity please sign up on the pad
   http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition as soon as
   convenient.
   - Coordinators can then introduce themselves to each other in the next
   week or so and get an initial call arranged or at least split off the
   mailing list for in-depth discussion about how to proceed and what we
   should aim to accomplish.
   - Updates will be sent to the main mailing list so don't worry if you
   can't sign up right now but think you might be able to assist in the future.

We can review the sign ups in a week and get started with some more
detailed planning! This idea is still very much open to comments and
criticism and again, if you know any friendly economists or data
journalists who might be keen to get on board do point them in our
direction!

Hmm... if the OAButton showed you your own research (e.g. just by name),
showed you how many people hit a paywall trying to get your article(s) and
prompted you to deposit, that seems like a good way of convincing more
people to do it. Would it not be insanely complex in terms of finding WHERE
to deposit to though? (I.e. has to be a local institutional repo because UK
is not Norway, correct me if I'm wrong.)

Also I'm not sure how much metadata they hold about the articles people
report using the OAButton. An integration between the OAButton data and
CrossRef has more chance here, and is a cool idea. There's not enough
integration between OAButton and repos yet, though we do use CORE to look
stuff up automatically for our users. Not enough for a workshop on its own
unless more development happens in this area, but could be included.


> 2) Indexing content for search and discovery.

I think Jorum, the open educational resource system, is built on DSpace,
and that's doing fine with its catalogue: http://find.jorum.ac.uk/
But I guess what the audience will really want to hear about is basically
an open alternative to Google Scholar.

One thing which can attach information to very large amounts of DOI-s is
http://oag.cottagelabs.com/ , a mass license checker - goes directly to
publisher websites and scrapes them (or uses API-s where available). So
this is not precisely discovery just yet, but it does fill the legal gap
(the license of the items we index for discovery and search).

Many have tried to build an open index of scholarship (I've tried with
others too, still trying) but I haven't heard of a big one just yet. While
this is probably the "ultimate" topic of such a workshop, I don't think
we're at the stage where you can base a workshop on that idea. Maybe the
other 2 examples above + other existing projects come together to a greater
whole worthy of a workshop though.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Subject: [open-science] Can you help Royal Society with Taxonomies of
	Science?
Message-ID: <CAD2k14OiSbheBp7Hb1apiZrAYwcd6q6Sa2Oc0ZfQ=W779YN4_Q@mail.gmail.com>

I got this mail from Francis Bacon (Royal Society of Britain), whowould
like a scientific taxonomy for organising the RS webpages. We swapped
emails and we both agree there is no perfect answer, but we'd like
suggestions for high-level taxonomies. It's probably more important for
them to exist and be proven useful in some field than trying to create yet
another one. I'd look to libraries, encyclopedias, museums, etc. for
authoritative inspiration:

Hi Peter



Hope you?re well.



Do you happen to know of any open or collaborative
taxonomies/classifications of scientific subjects?



One that might, for instance, specify that bioinformatics is a sub-category
of both biology and computer science.



We?re doing some planning for our website and I?d like to ensure we know
about all the options before picking a particular taxonomy/folksonomy.



Many thanks in advance,



Francis

?? Why does it have to be a local institutional repo? This religious
insistence on Universities at the centre has held us back. I use to work
for Glaxo - where do I put my papers? Where do Cottagelabbers put them? The
fewer outlets (> 1 but small) the better. Options include:

* arXiv
* EuropePMC
* CKAN
* Wikipedia

and perhaps national libraries.

>>Also I'm not sure how much metadata they hold about the articles people
report using the OAButton. An integration between the OAButton data and
CrossRef has more chance here, and is a cool idea. There's not enough
integration between OAButton and repos yet, though we do use CORE to look
stuff up automatically for our users.

Why should we base the future on a system that clearly isn't (yet) working.
Given the choice of going to Wikipedia and
theUniversityOfNowhereIHaveHeardOf where would people want to go?

Is it? Can I search for (say) "Blackbird" or "Turdus Merula"? I don't get
any results. We need to build our own.

Yes.

http://oag.cottagelabs.com/ , a mass license checker - goes directly to
publisher websites and scrapes them (or uses API-s where available). So

(the license of the items we index for discovery and search).

Excellent.

>>Many have tried to build an open index of scholarship (I've tried with
others too, still trying) but I haven't heard of a big one just yet. While
this is probably the "ultimate" topic of such a workshop, I don't think
we're at the stage where you can base a workshop on that idea. Maybe the
other 2 examples above + other existing projects come together to a greater
whole worthy of a workshop though.

There is no technical reason why not, and I think the need is becoming
clearer. Figshare showed that one graduate student can change the world,
OAButton showed that undergraduates will. Wikipedia has built a better
knowledge engine than almost any university. We have all the indexing tools
built (we can add Pubcrawler to the Cottagelab tools) and the problem can
be scaled with committed humans.

Open data formats are not in doubt. But the absence of tools should not
hold us back. Much of this will be name-value pairs - even if the name is
not in an ontology it's useful. Thus:

species="Erithacus rubecula"

may not resolve against an RDF triple store but it's a lot better than zero.

You misread me :
" problems of legacy data formats" did not mean I want to translate
something useful into obscure binary commercial legally protected DRM.
There are enough chemical software companies that do that. I want to
translate obscure binary protected formats into Unicode-compliant ASCII and
where possible indexed again known formal ontologies such as Chemical
Markup Language.

Improving the semantics of data will encourage people to build tools. They
are mutually dependent but we have to start somewhere.

I'd strongly support this - but it's a lot of design and a lot of
implementation. And we are often starting from scanned pixel pages or
broken PDF. Anything that takes those forward is IMO valuable.

Excellent suggestions and I would hope that PLoS would be receptive to this
becoming widely used (else it's just another confusion)

The following are useful, but the RS covers all subjects.

Q2 is mainly predicated on scholars and their organisations. Q1 reaches out
to the whole world.

Wikipedia addresses Q1. It addresses Q2 on the basis that the information
can be found. Neitehr of those currently resides in Universities to a
significant amount.

Thanks!! That is my commitment as well. It's not the first time we have
rasied this, but the first is not always the one that survives.

Yes. The idea was strong at BeyondThePDF2. It's an idea whose time has
arrived (I think).

And we can do it in stages - starting with high-quality, valuable, Open
material.

In principle I agree. But none of these was by global design. Wikipedia
overtook other free encyclopedias. So I think we have to accept there will
be a small number of "competing" approaches (<= 3). Then  the best and most
usable solutions will emerge. We cannot *design* the best final solution.
We can build it and work to making it the fittest.

The whole system of IRs necessarily and *by design* leads to

Totally agreed. IRs have destroyed any sense of community solution. In fact
any solution of anything based on universities will balkanize. That is why
the excitement happens outside.

Yes. I'd be happy for one national repository per country because nations,
unlike universities have an interest and experience in building good
information systems. If done well it then becomes  a feasible task to unite
or overlay them, because the nations will *want* them to be used.

The alternatives are:
* rapid uncontrolled evolution of bottom-up tools. This may work (e.g.
Figshare) as long as it's Open.
* large benign institutions such as Mozilla, Wikipedia or OKFN taking a
lead.
* monopolist capitalists (e.g. Mendeley). I'm not keen on this one.

There is no technical reason.

arXiv is a preprint server though I gather that many authors later submit
their final corrected version of record.

Many chemistry publishers forbid preprints. Chemist would swallow prussic
acid rather than put their work in a preprint server. There are groups in
the same laboratory who only know what the neigbouring lab is doing by
reading the literature. Imperial College chemists demanded that all theses
are embargoed for at least 5 years - because there is a danger that someone
might read them.

I believe in discipline repositories where the community approves -
bioscience  and astronomy are good on this. Putting science in an IR
destroys it - you have to have a practising expert associated with the
repo. arXiv has that.

None of us know how to build the whole thing. Some of us things we know how
to start. We want other people to become involved and change those ideas,
improve them, implement them. No, lecturing at people isn't really
appropriate.

Sorry Peter, I didn't mean "that's the only option", it's just the first
thing everybody tries to do. I definitely go to CORE and in general
aggregating information from individual repositories when a piece of
software needs to be able to find papers. I quite agree that a centralised
e.g. Norway's approach is superior in many ways. That's quite the paradigm
shift though. We need to identify ways of making people believe this is
possible and see the benefits + address concerns they have.

Right, fair enough.

Dumb question: why can't arXiv handle content from all disciplines?
(Manpower? Technical debt? All of it probably boils down to willingness and
money, but if we can identify problems with existing
centralised-but-not-comprehensive-enough systems, we can do something about
it.)

But Wikipedia covers everything, or at least doesn't exclude based on
discipline. Is there a system that can take all of UK's research metadata?
CKAN and elasticsearch and friends don't count until they're deployed with
a wrapper that allows depositing in multiple ways and covered server bills.

You mention Wikipedia, and it does fulfil those criteria. But how can we
deposit research metadata on wikipedia (or more broadly, how to use it to
describe research)? You could run a wiki which stores all the full text of
all the OA articles or the PDF file where that's unavailable. But this is
still a piece of software, not a system. If we're not talking about wiki
software, but Wikipedia.org, I'm not sure how research metadata (or the
text of all the OA research) would fit into it.

Hm, my notion of a workshop was more towards the "people come to hear how
to do this or about work in progress on this", but it's actually a lot more
of a discussion / contribution thing. I guess you can run them both ways,
more towards the lecture side of the spectrum and more towards the hacking
side. So yes, "Building the Green cake and decorating it" or a subset of
that is a viable topic then.

So how did arxiv do it? Can they take on more or can we replicate it
(without duplicating their efforts obviously). Note they're still hosted by
a single institution, yet archive the content of whole disciplines (or
close to it). So even the potential politics that you'd think would break
such a project obviously didn't.

Right, well http://cottagelabs.com/news/an-academic-catalogue . But as in
summer 2012, the issue is time, who has the availability to commit properly
to this kind of project / this project, bring it to MVP, get some users (so
you can't give up) and keep at it?
It's not even like we tried that hard to get help with it (money and
people), just because we had to build other things. And obviously we're
still working on it, but it feels like the kind of thing that should have
been available years ago. I want to be using it! (I don't mind building it,
but not having it is frustrating.)

Every. single. discussion. that a research-related project like OAButton
and OAG has ends up in "we want a queryable index of all the research with
licensing info and an API and a data dump, so not Google Scholar .. uh ok
let's use CORE but we want a better one".

For nearly ten years I have tried to promote the idea of indexing or
repositories and got nowhere. I wish it were different. As examples:

* I ran a funded JISC (UK) project on Open Bibliography.I offered to
explore the indexing of theses (unlike NL it is impossible to find online
theses in UK other than manually trawling through 200 repos). I presented
to the ETHOS project but their priority was to digitize the past.They told
me I would have to seek permission from every individual author.

* I wrote to Bernard Rentier offering to come to Liege and investigate
indexing the ORBI repository on a scientific basis. His repsonse was that
they were taking a staged approach and that [paraphrasing] I should wait a
few years.

* After a tweet I thought that LSE was intested and blogged a proposal to
index it. They weren't actually interested.

* I wrote several times to the Cambridge Librarian about text-mining. She
never acknowledged my mails.

More generally:

* repo owners are no interested in anyone outside their library doing
anything with their content. They have a ?10-year (or longer) plan to
federate them

* some repo owners (including Liege) deliberately choose CC-NC and refuse
to change.

So personally I have become disillusions with conventional repos. The UK
REF makes it worse as the sole purpose of many repos seems to be to
accumulate the content on which the university is formally judged.This does
not have to be Open. The mentality is not a service positively exposing
content to the world but a bureaucratic management process.

It may be different in other countries...


No - trying to index even one UK

Subject: [open-science] Open Scholar Foundation
Message-ID: <CABPM+wqMbJ09Nt8m6he2XqTt6g_hw5bDd_mo56KLRzQXom4H4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Please see the new post up on the Open Science blog from Tobias Kuhn
regarding his ideas for an Open Scholar Foundation to offer recognition for
those who practise open research:

http://science.okfn.org/2013/12/06/open-scholar-foundation/

All feedback on this mailing list or in the comments on the blog post would
be welcome, I have cc'd Tobias so you can contact him directly if you
prefer.

The post text is copied below for convenience!

Jenny


The goal of the Open Scholar
Foundation<http://www.openscholarfoundation.org/>is to improve the
efficiency of scholarly communication by providing
incentives for researchers to openly share their digital research
artifacts, including manuscripts, data, protocols, source code, and lab
notes.

The proposal of an ?Open Scholar Foundation? was one of the winners of the
1K challenge of the Beyond the PDF conference:
http://www.force11.org/node/4358 This was the task of the challenge:

What would you do with 1K that would significantly advance scholarly
communication that does not involve building a new software tool?

The idea was to establish a committee that would certify researchers as
?Open Scholars? according to given criteria. This was the original proposal:

I would set up a simple "Open Scholar Foundation" with a website,
where researchers can submit proofs that they are "open scholars" by
showing that they make their papers, data, metadata, protocols, source
code, lab notes, etc. openly available. These requests are briefly
reviewed, and if approved, the applicant officially becomes an "Open
Scholar" and is entitled to show a banner "Certified Open Scholar
2013" on his/her website, presentation slides, etc. Additionally,
there could be annual competitions to elect the "Open Scholar of the
Year".

An alternative approach (perhaps more practical and promising) would be to
provide a scorecard for researchers to calculate their ?Open Scholar Score?
on their own. There is an incomplete draft of such a scorecard in the
github repo here<https://github.com/tkuhn/openscholar/blob/master/docs/scorecard-draft.md>
.

In any case, his project should lead to an established and recognized
foundation that motivates scholars to openly share their data and results.
Being a certified Open Scholar should be something that increases one?s
reputation and visibility, and should give a counterweight to possible
benefits from keeping data and results secret. The criteria for Open
Scholars should become more strict over time, as the number of
?open-minded? scholars hopefully increases over the years. This should go
on until, eventually, scholarly communication has fundamentally changed and
does not require this special incentive anymore.

It is probably a good idea to use Mozilla Open
Badges<http://openbadges.org/>for these Open Scholar banners.

We are at the very beginning with this initiative. If you are interested in
joining, get in touch with us! We are open to any kind of feedback and
suggestions.

Salut Laurent,

You touch upon a very serious point. You should indeed consider researchers' egos more, as you sort of admit. After all, the issue is not so much technological (in spite of appearances) as it is psycho-sociological. Egos are important in what is, in many respects, the academic 'ego-system'. The system hangs together with recognition, credits, acknowledgement and the like. The highest barriers and strongest impediments are not technical. Where they are, they can be remedied comparatively easily. The (sub)cultural barriers don't get enough attention, I think (maybe I don't move in the right circles), and those are the most important to break down. We need more psychologists in the discussion to drive it forwards, perhaps.

Bon ouiquainde!

Best,

Jan

I now see colleagues rushing to ResearchGate or Acdemia just because they receive nice messages tickling their ego and they don?t even notice that their online papers in HAL are downloaded 50 times more. OK, it?s maybe our fault that we do not provide adequate statistics and that we do not consider researchers? ego enough.

It doesn't. I just think the 'cultural' issues are underrepresented in any discussions. One such issue is central vs. institutional repositories. That's a choice, hardly a technical issue.

Of course not. The 'thing being available' is a conditio sine qua non. But as Laurent said, "we do not provide adequate statistics and we do not consider researchers; ego enough."

Take the opposite: make it available only in a closed-access journal and no PDF anywhere .. and others will still be able to plagiarise or not cite + even less people will actually see / cite the article. Maybe I need to talk to somebody with more nuanced understanding of this bit, since I hope this is not the ol' piracy argument all over, but with recognition substituted for money.

No, it isn't at all. But the cause of open access, which I fully espouse, would benefit from understanding the deeper psycho-sociological issues and (lack of) motives why such a large number of researchers still stick by the traditional system and do not deposit willingly, so that 'mandates' are needed. Just calling researchers ignorant, or even stupid, as is done by some, simply doesn't wash. Those psycho-sociological ? cultural, if you wish ? elements make me think that for readers as well as authors a central, easily accessible, e.g. national, or even global, repository with standardised and easy deposit and access procedures and rules (e.g. TDM-able) is best for everyone. That's I think what Laurent has in mind as well. He will correct me if I'm wrong. If deposit and finding/access of content in repositories is easy and convenient, authors are more likely to see its attractions. One attracts butterflies with honey, not with vinegar.

The (sub)cultural barriers don't get enough attention, I think (maybe I don't move in the right circles), and those are the most important to break down.

Wikipedia won't like a mass upload of academic papers but there is
discussion to use Wikimedia Commons and/ or Wikisource this way,
though it's not yet clear what to do with supplementary files in
formats not allowed on those platforms (e.g. doc and xls).

Because some librarians (certainly in UK) see it as part of their job to
emphasize what you can't do... Many deliberately (e.g. Bath) add CC-NC

OK. Peter, our PhD repository (tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/) is full of

My program AMI does not understand the word "boring". She has the emotional

index on Species and they should be the same, so this is a great opportunity

Agreed. But that has to include  people like the current members of the

Firstly people outside the inward-looking repo circle need to be made
welcome. That's not just me, it's Mike Taylor, it's the OAButton
undergraduate students, it's Kitware, it's the #scholarlypoor. It's
Wikipedia and Mozilla. Repositories should be actively seeking the outside
world.

Secondly there has to be investment of effort in getting people using this
in a modern way. Maybe this happens for HAL, but it certainly doesn't in
UK. Maybe I can help make it happen. Who knows?

Hi Tobias,

I think the overall concept is a neat idea.  Personally, I would prefer the
self-assessment over assessment by committee for both practical and
ideological reasons.   I think it does more good in terms of shifting
social paradigms to have people self-identify as an open scholar without
being particularly open then it does to have rather open scholars not
identified as open by some committee.

Also, I don't like the concept of a "score" on several levels:

  (a) the number would be meaningless. You cannot add ranks across
different dimensions (papers vs lab notes).  A highly multidimensional
vector space does not deserve to be reduced to a single scalar quantity.
 Yes this happens all the time and we should not encourage it.  I'd be far
happier to identify scholars leading best practices in metadata standards
and those leading best practices in software sharing as separate concepts.
 (This is not a dig at altmetrics, only at combining any metrics that have
different units into a single number).
  (b) I don't like the competitive element.  I share my own lab notebook in
order to do better science, not in order to be "more open" than the next
guy.


Cheers,

Carl

I agree, that's why any attempts in this direction have carefully
selected their targets: my bot, for instance, only targets audio and
video files under CC BY or CC0 that are available from PubMed Central.

I don't see any prospect of any Wikimedia project allowing licenses
that restrict reuse beyond CC BY-SA. Nor any reason why they should.

So what? You certainly can use your real name in both traditions.

So what? Scholarly norms have yet to come to grips with versioned
documents but I think that closer inspection and practical experience
tends to shift the balance in favour of public version histories. And
while the large corpus of information available from Wikipedia
certainly includes plagiarism, my experience is that copyright issues
are being dealt with rather professionally in most cases, once they
have been identified.

The policies are evolving too, but not currently in the ways you outline above.

Few academics care about (and are aware of the implications of) the
agreements they sign on licensing or copyright transfer. But maybe
they will start thinking about that if they see their name on a list
of papers reported via the OA button or a video from one of their
papers embedded in a Wikipedia.

Many will share your opinion. But I think it is possible to configure
Wiki(p/m)edia engagement in a way that it is useful to the
contributors, even if they are scholars.

Slowly but steadily forward. The current state is at

So far we have

1/ basic infrastructure with metadata, original files and indexed full text
2/ (the right) usage stats

http://Altrmetric.com and http://Impactstory.org strike me as nice bits of
kits which already do all the "look your article was downloaded > 100
times" stuff, so #1 could be an additional data source for these services.
Obviously they could go away at any point, but that's hardly a concern
right now considering we haven't managed #1 in the UK yet.

Another thing...

This seems incontrovertibly true. But why does that work against a
centralised system of access / easier access in other forms though?

The thing being available doesn't mean people won't give credit. On the
contrary, it means more people will see it, more will use it, and more will
give credit. Take the opposite: make it available only in a closed-access
journal and no PDF anywhere .. and others will still be able to plagiarise
or not cite + even less people will actually see / cite the article. Maybe
I need to talk to somebody with more nuanced understanding of this bit,
since I hope this is not the ol' piracy argument all over, but with
recognition substituted for money.

That's a very general question, so here are some general pointers:

.

With respect to the subject of this thread, it may indeed be
interesting to discuss Wikimedia platforms as repositories of
scholarly materials, or their interaction with more classical
repositories.

As far as I can see, you are the first to make that extrapolation.

However, if scholars publish their research under a
Wikimedia-compatible license, that allows anyone (scholar or not) to
move those articles (or, more commonly, parts thereof, especially
images and multimedia) to Wikimedia platforms, as long as the
communities there accept that. It seems they do - currently, there are
over 20k files from OA sources on Wikimedia Commons, of which 6k are
used a total of 66k times across 300 other Wikimedia projects (cf.
http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/glamorous.php?doit=1&category=Open+access+%28publishing%29&use_globalusage=1&ns0=1&depth=5&projects[wikipedia]=1&projects[wikimedia]=1&projects[wikisource]=1&projects[wikibooks]=1&projects[wikiquote]=1&projects[wiktionary]=1&projects[wikinews]=1&projects[wikivoyage]=1&projects[wikispecies]=1&projects[mediawiki]=1&projects[wikidata]=1&projects[wikiversity]=1
),
and together, those 66k pages get over a million page views per day
(except on Saturdays; cf.
http://tools.wmflabs.org/glamtools/baglama.php?group=Open+access+%28publishing%29&date=201310
), which means considerable exposure for the underlying research
topics. Naturally, works not published under Wikimedia-compatible
licenses are not affected.

Besides, PLOS Computational Biology rarely publishes review articles,
and apart from RNA Biology (which has a manuscript track that also
generates Wikipedia articles, but separate from the manuscripts), it
currently is the only scholarly journal to publish articles destined
for any Wikipedia, which means we are on new ground here, where
explosive growth is not to be expected.

   Thursday, 20 February 2014, 08:00
To Saturday, 22 February 2014
by  iryna <iryna.kuchma at eifl.net>Hits : 46

Day 1 - Thursday 20th Feb @ the Royal Geographical Society, London

On the first day we will set the scene - hearing from some of the leading
figures in citizen science and exploring the process of public engagement
and participation, outreach of citizen science to the developing world, and
the undertaking of "extreme" citizen science projects, in rain forests, the
arctic tundra, or urban jungles.

Day 2 - Friday 21st Feb @ University College London

On the second day we will look beneath the surface. Experts will discuss
the hardware and software that powers citizen cyberscience. There will be
panel discussions with citizen scientists about participation and
engagement, and a showcase of new and future citizen science projects. In
the afternoon we will switch over to Hack Day mode with workshops and an
Open Space for working on ideas and challenges.

Day 3 - Saturday 22nd Feb @ University College London

On the third day we get down to business?together! The Hack Day continues
with workshops about developing hardware and software prototypes, lightning
talks with demos and mock-ups, and an Open Space to work on ideas and
challenges. We will wrap up the day with a Hack Day Show & Tell and a
Reception.

During the summit, there will be many opportunities to present short
papers, run panels, organise workshops or provide showcase demonstrations.
We would like to invite anyone interested in participating in this way to
submit brief proposals of up to 750 words.

This is a great and much-needed discussion of the ways in which IRs need to
grow (or evolve) in order to provide both depositors/authors and readers
with the functionalities they desire.

FWIW, a number of institutions in the US (including ours) are moving away
from DSpace towards Hydra, which will give the freedom of development so
that we can build the functionalities mentioned above. Everyone agrees that
the silos we've created for each institution are outdated. We're trying to
crack the nut of building repos that primarily serve authors that don't
have centralized subject repos like Dryad to deposit their scholarship,
while also allowing for greater collaboration across institutions.

One q I have for this list is what specific tasks would a researcher who
wishes to harvest IR content via API need to be able to do? Our internal
discussions about desired new IR functions don't include an API for
researchers--but that doesn't mean it _couldn't_ include such an API.
Feedback from the list would be appreciated and could inform future
development.

Also, a few points:

- In the US, there's also been a movement towards creating a searchable
federation of IRs called SHARE [1], which originally was designed to
compete with the CHORUS proposal. HOWEVER, from what I've heard, even if
SHARE dies as a CHORUS competitor, many still recognize the value inherent
in having a nationally federated IR system and the project would likely
move forward in any event. SHARE would need to ensure that its content
could be easily searched and indexed by a variety of systems beyond Google
Scholar and OAIster [2], which has sub-par search capabilities.

- I agree with both Jan that usability has been a major socio-technical
barrier for researchers to adopt the practice of making their work OA in
any repository. We (IR admins and developers) need to fix this major
problem before we can offer IRs as a solution to any problem of access or
preservation, and we DEFINITELY need to make sure our IRs are usable before
we encourage faculty to work towards enacting OA mandates.

- A reminder about why we need an open alternative to Google Scholar:

Hi all,

We just pulled back the curtain on our latest collaboration over at the Science Lab around code in research. We're thrilled to be working with the folks at GitHub and figshare (code and data repositories) on this, and wanted to share with this group.

You can read more about it on our blog:

http://mozillascience.org/code-as-a-research-object-a-new-project/

Also, we'll have Arfon (GitHub) and Mark (figshare) on our Mozilla Science Lab community call tomorrow fielding questions. Even more of a reason to come join. (Fun starts at 11 ET):

This looks great, I will certainly try to join and listen in tomorrow.
I am very interested to learn more about this!

Subject: [open-science] ESWC 2014 Call for Demos
Message-ID: <mailman.0.1386945102.6293.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Call for Demos ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-demos
	
The demonstrations track of the ESWC 2014 complements the overall program of the conference with demonstrations of real-world, applied-and-tested advances of semantic technologies. In addition to papers and posters presenting latest theoretical achievements, the ESWC 2014 is seeking demonstrations of novel applications of semantics in various sectors, including: eGovernment,  eEnvironment, eMobility and smart cities, eHealth, Life Sciences, Sensor networks and RDF Stream Processing, Linked Science, Media and entertainment, Telecommunications, Cultural heritage, Financial services, Energy and utilities, Manufacturing, Digital libraries, Cloud applications, Personal Information Management, Decision support, Emergency and crisis management etc.

The demonstrations track is an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to present their innovative prototypes, practical developments, on-going projects, lessons learned and late-breaking results, relevant for the topics of interest of the main conference and the research and poster tracks.

Submissions to the demonstrations track should make clear what will be demonstrated, and in particular point out what makes the demonstration a novel showcase. A video of the demo should be provided if a link to the demonstrator is not available. Submission should also specify:

* What is the research background and application context of the demonstration, and what makes this a novel showcase for semantic technologies.
* What is the key technology used, and how does the demonstrated system, application or infrastructure relate to pre-existing work.
* What exactly will be demonstrated? What exactly will a visitor of the demonstration learn?
 

* Submission Guidelines *

Submissions to the demonstrations track must be in the form of a textual description of the demonstration to be given at the conference (which may include screenshots and must include either a link to the online demo or a video presenting it). The submissions must be at most 5 pages long including reference list (Springer LNCS style) and submitted as PDF. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web area, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

Submissions should be uploaded using the Easychair system:

==== Call for Posters ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-posters

11th ESWC Conference 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Poster and Demo Chairs:
- Raphael Troncy (Multimedia Department, EURECOM, FR)
- Eva Blomqvist (Department of Computer and Information Science, Linkoping University, SE)

		
The poster track of ESWC 2014 will provide an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, on-going research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Posters are intended to provide authors and participants with the ability to connect with each other and to engage in discussions about the work.

We invite submissions relevant to the area of the Semantic Web that address, but are not limited to, the topics of the Research Track. Theoretical or technical posters, reports on semantic systems (however, demonstrations of such systems should be submitted in the demo track), descriptions of completed work, and work in progress are equally welcome.

Papers submitted to the research track will NOT automatically be considered for the poster track. A separate poster submission must be made. For example, a poster can be used to present work that was insufficiently mature for the research track.


* Submission Guidelines *

Authors must submit a 4-page paper (PDF, Springer LNCS style) with a short abstract for evaluation. The paper must clearly demonstrate relevance to the Semantic Web and the topics of interest of ESWC 2014. Decisions about acceptance will be based on relevance to the Semantic Web, originality, potential significance, topicality and clarity. Papers that exceed the given page length or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be rejected without a review.

Submissions should be uploaded using the Easychair system:

Subject: [open-science] Open Content Mining - New Mailing List & Workshop
	Material
Message-ID: <CABPM+wq-Wbc0mCx63gu=oC7JAWGX0Q3-O7b3FS=htuKsev08pQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

As you know, several members of the working group have a long standing
interest in content mining and continuing work on this theme will be a
major project for us going forward. There are big changes in policies and
even laws afoot in the UK and Europe, there is a need for tools, training
to use them and awareness raising among the research community about the
potential of content mining.

While general discussion will remain on this mailing list, we have set up a
new list for in-depth discussion on open content mining - open source
tools, open access material to mine, open output data and more:
https://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-contentmining

All are welcome to join and people have started posting ideas already so do
check out the archives once you've subscribed:
https://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-contentmining/

ALSO

Oxford Open Science recently hosted a Content Mining: Scholarly Data
Liberation Workshop and the materials are now up on the OKF Open Science
blog:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/12/14/content-mining-scholarly-data-liberation-workshop/

Have a go with some of the tools and code we were playing with and let us
know if you think content mining could help you in your research.

Hi all,

People on the Open Science Collaboration blog are collecting events for an
open science timeline. We've got a bias towards psychology events due to
the group members, but we'd also like to have events outside of psychology.

Any suggestions?

Cool. Do I need to scrape that, or do you have it in a machine readable
form? We are entering things in to a spreadsheet to be consumed by a
javascript widget. or at least that is hte preliminary plan.

Subject: [open-science] Has anybody ever heard about Quandl?
Message-ID: <126295ce42ab4c8cbaae9f7d54aaca07@DBXPR04MB221.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi all,

I have recently received an e-mail containing an invitation to try out Quandl <http://www.quandl.com> and to provide some feedback.

The e-mail content was (basically) the following:

"[..] We have developed a platform for data tailored for researchers, and especially students.  
The site is open and free, and has over 8 million economic, demographic, social, and more time series datasets available for downloading.  
Importantly, the ease by which a user can find, trim, transform, merge, and download time series data from Quandl is -in my opinion- unmatched elsewhere. "

There was also a link to a page tailored for researchers, <http://www.quandl.com/academics>.

I have never heard about this before. There are no claims on the license of those datasets, only that:
"Every single public dataset on Quandl is and will always be, free and open to everyone. Our mission is to make the world's open data easy to find and easy to use."

Failing to commit to a CC license is worrying, and I read somewhere that they act as the intermediate to provide "the most fresh version of reliable datasets, directly from their source".

I am not sure what to think about this website. Therefore, I am doing the most reasonable thing I can do: I share this with you.

Your thoughts?

All the bests,

Hi Sheila,

We've recently created an online Open Education timeline 
<http://education.okfn.org/timeline/>.  It is still a work in progress 
but may be worth having a flick through to see if there are any relevant 
details/events.

Thanks

                      *It?s
time to register for the Citizen Cyberscience Summit!*

*Following successful Citizen Cyberscience Summits in 2010 and 2012,
registration is now open for the third meeting in London on 20-22 February
2014: **http://cybersciencesummit.org/register/
<http://ucl.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=44f4fdd80f93a247bc56da002&id=7436b26bed&e=6e7cdc708d>*

Citizen cyberscience refers to the wide range of activities that enable
people from all walks of life to join in scientific projects through
internet-based applications such as contributing the unused processing
power of their computers to help scientific computing, classifying
information, using their smartphones to collect nature observations or
building their own Internet-enabled sensors to collect environmental
information.

The 3-day event offers citizen scientists, practitioners, enthusiasts,
policy makers and scientists a unique opportunity to meet and discuss
citizen science and citizen cyberscience, participate in activities, and
develop prototypes for new projects.

If you would like to see a workshop about a topic that interests you, give
a talk about a citizen science project you are passionate about or share
the learning from a DIY science project, there is still time to suggest
papers at http://cybersciencesummit.org/call-for-participation/<http://ucl.us7.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=44f4fdd80f93a247bc56da002&id=06ff43e63a&e=6e7cdc708d>


*The programme will cover policy, science and practice ? our c**onfirmed
speakers include:*

*Professor Jacquie McGlade, *a Special Advisor to UNEP?s Executive Director
working on the post 2015 development agenda and UNEP Live, UNEP's knowledge
platform. Jacquie has developed a range of fuzzy-logic software
applications for decision-making under high degrees of uncertainty, and
helped to create and launch Eye on Earth - the global public information
service.

*Dr Beau Lotto*, the founder of Lottolab, a hybrid art studio and science
lab. Beau?s experimentalist, visionary approach to science has won him a
wide audience, including the TED series, RSA series, and the BBC. He uses
illusions, games and plenty of interaction to engage his audience, and he
is skilled at communicating with people from all walks of life.

*James Borrell**,* whose aim is to encourage aspiring conservationists. His
first experience of expeditions was a month spent in the rainforests of
Madagascar at the age of 17. Subsequently he has been involved with several
further expeditions across the globe.  His research interests are the
effects of habitat fragmentation on the conservation of rare species. James
has just completed a Year of Citizen Science.

*Dr Rick Bonney*, the Director of Program Development and Evaluation at the
Cornell Lab of Ornithology. He is co-founder of the Lab?s Citizen Science
program. His research focuses on developing projects in which the public
actively engages in scientific investigation and environmental
conservation; and understanding the social and educational impacts of
public involvement in science.

*Dr Erinma Ochu*, a Wellcome Trust Engagement Fellow exploring the cultural
value of citizen science and innovative ways the public can participate in
biomedical research. Erinma believes that the world has so many problems -
let's solve them together! Mass collaboration, mass participation and
citizen-led social innovation are her passions.




*Full details of all our speakers will be posted on our website

	Community Organisers
Message-ID: <CABPM+wpzNtOnktpiQHLP5cWvDzMvVgoqphWVSTyexj32+oTfxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I thought as we get to the end of 2013 it would be good to let you know
where the working group is at currently and let you have your say on how we
might proceed in our mission to open up science during the next year!

We have grown to over 630 members (!) on the mailing list and now have
local groups or representation in:

Sweden
Finland
UK (Oxford, London, Cambridge)
Australia
Austria
France
Brazil
US

Which is fantastic, but we'd love to expand further! If you would like to
be an open science ambassador for your region/country/city/university then
get in touch.

To help us keep track of all these activities and make sure we're being as
effective as possible at providing a space for discussions and
collaboration around open science, it would be great to hear from anyone
who would like to be more involved in managing the working group (also, I
have a thesis due in 9 months so any and all help is very much welcome from
my perspective!).

We would like to put together a group of community organisers to contribute
to a variety of roles. There can be a name for this group but we haven't
settled on one yet - suggestions welcome.The time commitment will be
flexible and relatively low, but it will make a big difference to have
someone keeping an eye on specific areas. The roles and tasks might include:

Organising working group meetings
Planning open science events at OKFest 2014
Documenting events and updates from the working group
Coordinating specific projects or documents
Blog Editing
Tech/Dev Liaison
Event Organisation
Designing publicity materials and logos etc.

Do get in touch if any of this sounds of interest even if you are only able
to contribute a small amount of time. If you have any questions, please let
Zara, Michelle and I know and we look forward to hearing from you! Look out
for another email about specific projects, events and 2014 working group
activities coming shortly.

	Research Data Access
Message-ID: <CABOTVX_3vXR2SFgCkSHxkG7eiAp1AE=iE8EvhXb+a3UE=y07GQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

The RECODE Project (FP7 funded - more info found
http://recodeproject.eu/<http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Frecodeproject.eu%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFgxJqhVKKXRinrKVFnj_Id0XCt_g>)
has released a questionnaire with 'the objective of identifying the
technological infrastructural requirements for Open Access to Research Data
in Europe.'.

The second part of the questionnaire differs on whether you define yourself
as a researcher, publisher//librarian, funder or end user, but covers
questions such as:

   - What solutions are you aware of for preservation and curation of
   research data?
   - How do you describe and document the research data you manage,
   including their quality? (Please reference specific standards and
   technologies that you use or are aware of)
   - What solutions are you aware of for searching for and identifying
   relevant data?

Thought it might be of some interest to list members.

Michelle

Hi All

I thought as we get to the end of 2013 it would be good to let you know where the working group is at currently and let you have your say on how we might proceed in our mission to open up science during the next year!

We have grown to over 630 members (!) on the mailing list and now have local groups or representation in:

Sweden
Finland
UK (Oxford, London, Cambridge)
Australia
Austria
France
Brazil
US

Which is fantastic, but we'd love to expand further! If you would like to be an open science ambassador for your region/country/city/university then get in touch.
To help us keep track of all these activities and make sure we're being as effective as possible at providing a space for discussions and collaboration around open science, it would be great to hear from anyone who would like to be more involved in managing the working group (also, I have a thesis due in 9 months so any and all help is very much welcome from my perspective!).

We would like to put together a group of community organisers to contribute to a variety of roles. There can be a name for this group but we haven't settled on one yet - suggestions welcome.The time commitment will be flexible and relatively low, but it will make a big difference to have someone keeping an eye on specific areas. The roles and tasks might include:

Organising working group meetings
Planning open science events at OKFest 2014
Documenting events and updates from the working group
Coordinating specific projects or documents
Blog Editing
Tech/Dev Liaison
Event Organisation
Designing publicity materials and logos etc.

Do get in touch if any of this sounds of interest even if you are only able to contribute a small amount of time. If you have any questions, please let Zara, Michelle and I know and we look forward to hearing from you! Look out for another email about specific projects, events and 2014 working group activities coming shortly.

Thanks Sucith!

The call for proposals isn't out yet (keep an eye on
http://2014.okfestival.org/) but if you would be willing to put in a
session proposal that would be great!

For Helsinki it worked that a bunch of us planned an open science stream
with several events of varying priorities and applied for slots together,
so it may be a similar process this time around - we will definitely be on
to organising this as soon as the call is out.

Looking forward to hearing from you when you've chatted with colleagues.

Jenny

Hi Raniere

Great to hear from you and no problem! So we come up quite frequently
against tech related stumbling blocks. These can be either internal working
group things like making a suitable calendar (Stefan Kasberger has been
working on this) or my current one of how to display the working group
members on a map and in a list on the webpage while allowing people to add
and edit their details. Other times they are to do with linking to projects
like crowdcrafting.org and finding or making tools to accomplish certain
tasks, which we often put forward as challenges at hackdays but currently
no one is seriously tracking progress with them.

This role would be to coordinate solving the problems, not necessarily
needing to get in and fix them personally but getting the devs in the
working group together (we have quite a few but coordination is necessary!)
and also generally thinking about potential tech-related projects. We have
an open-science-dev mailing list but it is underpopulated and underused so
a potential role would be building that community and looking more
specifically at tools for open science, liaising with the CKAN development
team and OKFN Labs http://okfnlabs.org/.

Would any of this be of interest? Just let me know what type of thing you'd
like to get involved in.
If anyone else is able to help with working group web and tool issues
and/or building our tech/dev community then let me know!

Thanks very much for getting in touch :)

Jenny

	data events on 22 Feb!
Message-ID: <CABPM+woEkn6JKGVw3JOKiCcZD=J3MSZPPLyw8+ymBTJXnkP5SQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Open Data Day [1] will be taking place on 22 Feb 2014 and people are
gearing up to run events around the world. We would love to coordinate some
on open scientific data!

So what can you do?

   - If you're already running open science activities, make your Feb
   meeting data related and run it on 22 (this is my plan with Oxford Open
   Science).

OR

   - Organise a one-off in your city/university/department

OR

   - Participate in one of the many events already planned around the world.

AND

   - Send us your stories for the OKF blog afterwards!


There are instructions for adding your event to the official Open Data Day
list on the OKF blog [2].

However, do let the list know if you're planning something and we'll do a
round-up here and on the open science blog. Between us we can probably
connect people in similar localities together to help each other out and
make a bigger splash with their event.

Thanks very much!

Jenny

Hey all,

I know I'd be keen to push on with an idea previously floated about
exploring scholarly publishers (and learned societies) and their incomes.
(More information and th ebeginnings of a proposed data expedition found:
http://pad.okfn.org/p/scholarly-publishers-data-expedition).

The Open Knowledge Foundation is going to be doing more work next year
around open access - and it would be great to get some of this data
together to display visually.

Would anyone else be interested in this?

MIchelle

Thanks for looping me in to this conversation Heather!

I'd love to have a hangout in the New Year. I can't do anything w/c 13 Jan,
but have pretty good availability otherwise.

Subject: [Open-access] Open Data Access Point in R
To: open-access at lists.okfn.org


Dear members,

My proposal would be to have a thesaurus of navigation for an open data
catalog in multiple languages so I can plug it into
http://subject.ro/index.php?uri=uat.rdf (as a uri)
That way we can index data, messages/comments about the data, and offer
metadata back into R.

1. Why bring open data to R as a priority?
Because R has a very extensive library of algorithms and behavior that
complements any data.

2. Why subject.ro? What is subject.ro / what it plans to be?
We want to make it a general ontology based on the SKOS Thesaurus format.
For very easy human-led categorization as well as machine-readable.
We plan it as a gateway to liked and open data / indexed by subject. On the
web as well as in R.
our demo is for the ontology of Astronomy on their draft thesaurus (not
completed with all URIs) - so expect bugs from this side..

3. We would first begin with subject.ro data and behavior as a "portal" to
linked data in R because that will bring in R qualitative dimensions (by
controlled vocabularies). R is presently very good for quantitative data
but lacks ability to compute semantics.

4. subject.ro will keep it's data available for replication and
synchronization (for now in mysql, but with plans for CouchDB). We will
have mobile, desktop apps for interfacing with this data as well as in R
and the website. CouchDB is very good for distributed db.
We have extensive experience in programming for all platforms: web, mobile,
desktop for all operating systems. But we will need more volunteer
programmers for faster returns :)


Now I would like to talk about what we have already done to see the link to
our plans for subject.ro :
in http://sliced.ro/docs/docs/Science.html we have demoed some things that
we would like in R:

for each thesaurus we propose:
-have all terms at singular as number and masculine as gender (for the
appropriate languages)
-have the least number of words per term (prefer hyphenated and composed
word)
-have only the eponyms capitalized
-prefer the same number of words per term as the English term
-prefer to include in the term part of the inheritance (a term should
uniquely-define the reality without the need to know it's ancestry in the
graph) or have 2 versions of the thesauri: one with intrinsic identity and
one with possible extrinsic identity
-there should be just one preferred term for each language
-we also have to know for each term if it has single or multiple
inheritance

We should talk about each rule and I will tell you why I have reached these
conclusions. They are not the only possible solution.

Each language should have a function with the ability to form term's plural
and feminine forms.
There should be a function that takes in a text and a language code and be
able to compile a list of terms it contains.
There should be a function that takes in a text, a language and a target
language. It will return an exact translation for controlled terms and an
approximate translation of the rest using Google Translate.

As for Semantic Web processing: For any text+language:
There should be a function that returns the greater common term: the term
that contains all the other mentioned terms.
There should be a function that returns the smallest distinctors (an
invented idea): the terms that are the most detailed (the leaves in the
thesaurus graph)

Thesauri data and all these functions should be available in R (in the
subject.ro package).


We need scientific guidance on where this technology should lead and what
usecases can be derived. Please feedback.

Christian Tzurcanu, subject.ro

Hi Christian,
This is a fascinating project. Do you have any other publications or
documents about it?

Have you heard of Attempto controlled english (ACE) project? It is a
knowledge representation language that is both human readable and machine
readable. It could be a useful example for you term thesaurus. It converts
into OWL statments, which is a subset of RDF.

I couldn't do much on the subject.ro site. Is there some documentation
about how to use this site? The help link doesn't do anything.

Good luck with this project.

Ted Strauss

hey,

I will be in Berlin from March till August to study on FU Berlin 
(Geography) and I've already talked with Christian Heise from OKF-DE 
about organizing something at OKFest. We are actually thinking about 
connectiong different activities and groups to a german speaking OKFN 
Open Science Working Group from germany, switzerland, austria and 
lichtenstein. We will keep you up to date and blog about this in the 
next weeks. It's very early, but if you have some feedback, just write 
to me. If this works out and the communities are interested in it, we 
would like to organize some kind of kick off event (panel or hackathon) 
for the german speaking open science community.

If not, i would love to offer my resources to some other event.

and im also in for the geoscience event (at least hacking there), 
totally my field of interest :)

Cheers and nice holidays, Stefan

I'd also be very interested in Open Geo - especially geonames and other
tools for resolving names and coordinates in the scientific literature

> We would like to put together a group of community organisers to contribute to a variety of roles. There can be a name for this group but we haven't settled on one yet - suggestions welcome.The time commitment will be flexible and relatively low, but it will make a big difference to have someone keeping an eye on specific areas. The roles and tasks might include:
>
> Organising working group meetings
> Planning open science events at OKFest 2014
> Documenting events and updates from the working group
> Coordinating specific projects or documents
> Blog Editing
> Tech/Dev Liaison
> Event Organisation
> Designing publicity materials and logos etc.

> Do get in touch if any of this sounds of interest even if you are only able to contribute a small amount of time. If you have any questions, please let Zara, Michelle and I know and we look forward to hearing from you! Look out for another email about specific projects, events and 2014 working group activities coming shortly.
