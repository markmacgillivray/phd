Subject: [open-science] Open science and OKFN
Message-ID: <54f6f2050809070536s66d05da7jd860883de7f8d150@mail.gmail.com>

Just an e-mail about OKFN and open science, the state of open science,
and a suggestion as to what is needed.

Looking at the OKFN website, OKFN currently has no open science
projects. Some of the tools supported by OKFN are incidentally related
to open science (data distribution, e.g.). Have there been any ideas
or suggestions about how OKFN may develop open science other than
non-specific licenses and tools supported currently? What was the push
to set up this list?

Beyond OKFN, open science has been building momentum in the last two
years. Some notable open science projects (that I know of):

*http://www.biomedcentral.com/ BioMed Central - "an independent
publishing house committed to providing immediate open access to
peer-reviewed biomedical research". BioMed Central currently supports
a couple of hundred journals and licenses these under the CC-by-2.0
license, an OKFN Open Knoweldge Definition conformant license.

*http://sciencecommons.org/ Science Commons - "designs strategies and
tools for faster, more efficient web-enabled scientific research. We
identify unnecessary barriers to research, craft policy guidelines and
legal agreements to lower those barriers, and develop technology to
make research data and materials easier to find and use." A project of
Creative Commons.

*A number of projects maintained by the US federal government (the NIH
and the NCBI) are necessarily public domain.


Open science is multifaceted. The means to do research should be as
free and as open as possible (i.e. software tools), data must be open,
and papers and other interpretations of data must be open (free to
access and reuse). I here define "interpretations of data" very
broadly to include scientific papers, diagrams, other texts, and
annotation projects (annotated proteins/chemicals, e.g.). I would
suggest that these are the three areas that must be pursued in open
science: research tools, data and interpreted data.

The current state of science more-often-than-not results in
information and tools being locked-down. This is not compatible with
the spirit of science. To be explicit: the spirit of science is the
discovery and free exchange of scientific knowledge. If software tools
in research must be paid for, if data cannot be shared, and if a
subscription is required to access journal contents, the spirit of
science is betrayed. In these scenarios, profit-making has become more
important than science itself.

Thanks for your post Oldak!

I'll try and keep my response brief...

  * As mentioned on our blog, this list came out of discussions I had 
with Kaitlin Thaney (Science Commons) and Cameron Neylon (Open Wetware). 
None of us could think of a mailing list for those with a general 
interest in open science. The purpose of setting up this list was to 
keep these people in touch with each other. I hope it will become a 
relatively low volume list for relevant announcements, queries and other 
items of interest. (Our thinking was roughly 'we're all quite busy, but 
it would be nice to keep in closer contact'!)

  * The Open Knowledge Foundation aims to promote open knowledge in all 
its forms - including scientific publications, research data, and so on. 
At the moment our most relevant work is on standards (cf. 
http://opendefinition.org and Science Commons' Protocol for OA Data, 
http://ur1.ca/55e) and resource discovery (cf. http://ckan.net).
For more on the OKF and open science, see SC's interview with Rufus 
Pollock: http://ur1.ca/55f. We are currently planning an event on open 
science resource discovery for this autumn. We would very much like to 
provide whatever support we can to the open science community. Much of 
our work is 'community driven' - so feedback, suggestions, project 
proposals and so on are most welcome (probably off-list or on 
okfn-discuss would be best)!

  * Regarding your comments on areas of open science, you may be 
interested to see Science Commons' 'Principles for open science', 
presented in Barcelona in July: http://ur1.ca/55h.

I hope this is helpful!

Warm regards,

Jonathan

Looks interesting, they are partnering with www.ck12.org , does anyone have
experience or opinions about that organization?
Here is the Request for Information in HTML format:
http://doc.zooos.com/view?doc=http://www.technology.virginia.gov/PhysicsFlexbook_Final.doc
This is very good and exciting to see, however it seems like they are
starting from scratch, instead of building on any of the existing efforts?
Thanks for the info :)

I hadn't heard of them - but they look great! I just invited them to our 
open textbook meetup:

Since the House begins their recess on Sept 26th (and doesn't reconvene 
until January), no action will be taken on this bill until 2009:

some helpful info on the members of the committees:
http://openaccessday.org/2008/09/18/nih-mandate-under-attack-we-need-your-help-by-924/
Interesting to hear it will not have a chance of action for some time,
hopefully we can use that interval to spread awareness and gather
enough opinion to affect that of the representatives :)

Thanks for the link. I just emailed Cardin, who is the MD senator.
