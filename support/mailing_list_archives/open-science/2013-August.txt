Stefan, I asked at PLOS today and there are no current plans to run ASAP
again. That may happen, but it would not likely be next year, rather in a
few years.

I like the concept, 'as a practice' and the double meaning. BG

Subject: [GOAL] Discussion on Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes required by
Librarians for Open Access


{Apologies for Cross Posting}



I am currently assisting the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia
(CEMCA) in developing Curriculum and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) Tool for
Open Access for researchers and library and information professionals as a
project of UNESCO. The UNESCO adopted Open Access strategy in 2011, and
with effect from 1 July 2013 it has become fully Open Access. Capacity
building to promote Open Access is one of the important strands of the
UNESCO strategy.  The UNESCO Open Access Forum 2011 also recommended
training of young researchers and library professionals on Open Access.


As a first step, we would like to seek help of experts though a discussion
on this platform to identify Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes needed for
Open Access by Library and Information Professionals and Researchers. So,
we will have two strands of discussion: One for Librarians and the other
for Researchers. This week we start with training needs for Librarians?


Librarians play a significant role in providing access to peer reviewed
information published in journals and help manage local repositories.
Sometime back we did a Delphi study with select experts, which revealed the
following as key areas for the librarians to study:

* *
*Module 1: Foundations*

1. Introduction to Open Access: Definition, types (green, gold, delayed),
OA journals (gold and hybrid), OA books, OA repositories, benefits,
barriers (publisher resistance), philosophy of access to knowledge,
disciplinary trends; Open Access Policy development, including funder
policies

2. Copyrights and licensing mechanisms for Open Access, such as the
creative commons licenses, copyleft and publishers? embargo in
self-archiving

* *

*Module 2: Practical Options and Systems*

3. Repositories and issues involved in creating and maintaining
repositories, author self-archiving

4. Open Access Journal publishing systems and processes

* *

*Module 3: Initiatives, Implications and Issues*

5. Searching of Open Access information (Vehicles for Open Access: OAIster
and other Open Access Search Engines, PubMed), Metadata related issues,
SHERPA RoMEO, DOAJ, DOAB, GOAP, OA Map, etc.

6. Impact of Open Access on dissemination of knowledge, citation
advantages, estimating impact; Changing practices in scholarly
communication, including open peer review, emerging approaches to
recognition of scholarly works

7. Implications of online-only format for long-term preservation of OA
content (Google Books, Internet Archive, Hathi Trust, other non-U.S. large
initiatives)



While this is useful, we need to identify the Knowledge, Skills and
Attitudes to develop the curriculum and content learning materials. You may
also like to comment on the suitability of the above topics. If you want to
share more on the topic privately, kindly do so in the emails:

Message-ID: <CA+4KT3oexu+76zwCObvE86dgwZf_fXd_wDGr+-9SyE9xH1tAuw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

There is a discussion started by ms. Barnali on "Promoting Open Access
amongst young researchers" at WSIS (
http://www.wsis-community.org/pg/forum/topic/834997/promoting-open-access-amongst-young-researchers/
)

Here is the text of the post written by Ms. Barnali (
barna.chakrabarti at gmail.com)

{Apologies for cross posting}

I am currently assisting the Commonwealth Educational Media Centre for Asia
(CEMCA) in developing Curriculum and Self-Directed Learning (SDL) Tool for
Open Access for researchers and library and information professionals as a
project of UNESCO. The UNESCO adopted Open Access strategy in 2011, and
with effect from 1st July 2013 it has become fully Open Access. Capacity
building to promote Open Access is one of the important strands of the
UNESCO strategy. The UNESCO Open Access Forum 2011 also recommended
training of young researchers and library professionals on Open Access.

In the last week, I requested for help on articulating the training needs
of library professionals, and this week I would like to request the
stakeholders to think about what new researchers should know about Open
Access. We believe that the OA awareness of the researchers that can make
the Open Access movement more successful. In subject disciplines, where the
researchers are more aware and have common goals, the amount of information
available in OA is much higher than other disciplines. So, it is always
better to follow the principle of "catch them young", and include a short
training curriculum on OA for every researcher working for their doctoral
degree. This can be a pre-doctoral work as well. If such a programme is to
be organized, what are the knowledge, skills and attitude that should be
covered in the training?

In a survey conducted amongst researchers in a prestigious national
university revealed that most of the respondents indicated limited
participation in open access mode of communications either as users or as
contributors. The study also revealed that their participation can be
increased through appropriate training, and awareness creation. So, what
you think as the areas that should be covered in OA training for
researchers?

Your response will help us to articulate more precisely the topics related
to knowledge, skills and attitudes for Open Access. If you want to share
more on the topic privately, kindly do so in the E-mails:
smishra.col at gmail.com and barna.chakrabarti at gmail.com

Subject: [open-science] Annotating Open Images with licence and authorship
	to prevent copyfraud
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Oea9pKH2=Xkby5Nn4+b99j_s+7NnM+SiKtPys=_GWM6A@mail.gmail.com>

This is a suggestion for a very simple but effective tool/service to
address copyfraud (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyfraud) in images
(especially, but not specifically, in STEM). I and others (e.g. Wikimedia)
have suffered from having  CC-BY images "copyrighted" by a third party (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/06/13/springergate-springer-replies/ and
earlier). If the images were indelibly stamped with licences and authorship
copyfraud would be very much harder. I suspect this would also be welcomed
by authors themsleves as it promotes their authorship.

At hack4ac http://hack4ac.com/ I suggested a simple project/service to add
Open licence and author information into images. This was later entered as
a developer challenge at repository Fringe (
http://rfringe13.blogs.edina.ac.uk/2013/08/04/developer-challenge-the-results/).
Independently Chris Gutteridge took the idea and created an ePrints
plugin (and did it better than my code!) - our teams both won prizes. I
also talked with Open publishers including Mark Hahnel (Figshare) and Brian
Hole and they were interested in seeing the idea developed further,
possibly including implementing it.

Neither ChrisG or our team (Cesare Bellini and me) are going to take this
further ourselves but the response was sufficiently positive to see if
OKFNers are interested in seeing it happen.

The actual code is very simple (it took me about 10 lines of Java, Chris
used ImageMagick I think). It writes a licence (e.g. "CC-BY") and
optionally an authorname into the pixels of the image (either overwriting a
small area or transparency/blending). Options would include writing at a
chosen corner / side or adding a small border (which wouldn't affect the
image but would be easier to remove by cropping).

A tool could be used at many places:
* in the software that was used to create the image (e.g. ImageJ - a FLOSS
image manipulation tool for science)
* when the image was uploaded to a repository. Especially when done before
sending images to a publisher
* added by publishers who promote the value of Open licences
* retrospective addition to Open images (e.g. on CC-BY publishers sites or
Wikimedia). This would require the host to cooperate

I don't know whether this is in scope for
http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/London-GB/998522/ tonight's
Open Data maker session - I shall be there.

Message-ID: <3468D379-27DE-4B20-83FE-514154EA1B6D@bio.unc.edu>

Dear Open Science colleagues,

ODIN (ORCID and DataCite Interoperability Network) is a two-year EU-funded project that aims to increase the interoperability of trusted researcher and data identifiers and demonstrate the wonders that can be built upon such open services [1].  

We would like to invite interested members of the OKFN community to ODIN's first year conference and codesprint, to be held 15-17 October at CERN in Geneva.  In particular, the first two-days are solely given over to a codesprint (Oct 15-16) during which participants will collaborate on projects to demonstrate and take advantage of interoperable researcher and data identifiers, along with developers from ORCID & DataCite.

The third day (Oct 17) is a general conference open to all.  ODIN partners will share the results from the first half of the 2-year project and receive feedback from the community. 

The full program, codesprint ideas, and registration details, are at [2].  Participants are asked to cover their own travel and accommodation expenses.   Whether or not you can attend, you are invited to contribute to the codesprint ideas.  

First-time visitors to CERN might find a particular part of the program very interesting ? a guided tour of the Large Hadron Collider [3].   And you can see where the WWW was born [4]

We hope to see you in Geneva in October!  In the meantime, please let us know if you have any questions.

Yours,
The organizers (Amir Aryani, Martin Fenner, John Kaye, Neli Zhivkova Ivanova, Gudmundur Thorisson, Laura Rueda Garcia, Laure Haak, Sunje Dallmeier-Tiessen, Todd Vision)

Thanks,
It's useful to know that others are thinking this way. If I understand your
example it is to put metadata into the image where machines might detect
it. My suggestion is complementary - to make a permanent visual indication
of the licence - visual watermarking. There is nothing particular novel
(certainly not technical) but I think it needs advocacy.

The problem with metadata inside the file is that only machines can see it
and it is also fragile - easily removed either deliberately or by
copy/paste and otehr format conversions.

Just 2 cents.

Watermarks in the photos are also easily removed (search for
"watermark removal" - there are plenty of tools with impressive
capabilities). All easy ways to protect/stamp/mark digital content are
fragile. That's why I tend to agree with Michael Nielsen who argued
for DRM long time ago
http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/intellectual-property-automated-contracts-and-the-free-flow-of-information/

Without going into deep discussion on the tradeoffs of different
options, I have a small suggestion, assuming the watermarking idea is
going to take off. Embedded metadata allows to identify
incompatibilities (for example: identification that certain two images
are incompatible with each other when used together in a derivative
work) in an automated fashion. Your watermarked images could be used
in the same way, _provided_ the watermark is placed in a such way that
OCR tools could get the license information back.

Best wishes

Thanks for the link. As you may expect I don't agree with present DRM. (It
might be possible to design something different, and in a sense what I am
suggesting is a very weak form of that)

I  can appreciate that removing a watermark may be possible but it takes a
deliberate act. If I send an image to a publisher, marked as CC-BY PMR then
that cannot be removed automatically. And if it is removed manually then
it's a breach of trust and unacceptable in the community. The point is not
that it's sophisticated but that it makes it immediately visually clear
that the image is under someones licence. And since the mark may destroy
information then it may become clear that it has been removed.

The idea of it being visual is that it survives to print and other media,
which DRM will not.

I am welcome to any suggestions! This was a 2 hour hack. Indeed I would
hope that my initial idea would be transformed by the community.

Rephrase it at a higher level:

How can we simply, and unilaterally, add visual and/or metadata information
to images to assert that they are Open and therefore re-usable indefinitely?

Subject: [open-science] Open Science Calendar
Message-ID: <52011C8C.9070307@gmx.at>

Hello,

so, finally some progress on the open science calendar happened last
weekend. Michael Haubenwallner and me were coding a little bit to
provide an embedable form and google calendar for open science, based on
google spreadsheet, forms and calendar.
http://openscience.alpine-geckos.at/google-cal/

this is now a test version to find necessary features. right now it's
not possible to filter the export of the calendar by working group or
spatial area. Also the deletion of an event is not possible right now
via form and the formating of the event is very simple. the deletion
will be added later on, the filtering seems to be a little bit tricky,
we will see.

the question for us right now is, which way should we go?
one calendar for the open science working group or one for the whole
OKFN? i think the working group approach is better, cause on long term,
there should be an own webservice for all okfn related events (with
ticketing, booking and so on...).
the google app code is available, and also the form can be duplicated
pretty fast by hand, so its really easy to create a new form,
spreadshett and calendar.

and are there any features you miss?

so please send us back your wishes and feedback. we also created a
okfnpad for this: http://okfnpad.org/openscience-calendar

cheers, stefan

Dear all,

This last weekend the Citizen Cyberscience Centre organized the second CERN
summer student webfest<http://www.citizencyberscience.net/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page>.
I've participated in it, and I worked in a project championed by Michael
Doser, the spokesperson of the AEgIS experiment at CERN that studies
antimatter.

I worked with a very talented group of students and we made a CrowdCrafting
application that invites you to map tracks of antimatter from their
experiment.

The application is here: http://crowdcrafting.org/app/antimatter

The blog post is here:
http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/08/06/mapping-antimatter-with-crowdcrafting.html

Enjoy!

Daniel

PS: I'm CC okfn-labs as I mention briefly the technologies that we use

Hi David,

I agree with you! I love the "short movies", to me is like looking into the
deep space and see stars and galaxies colliding :-D The only difference is
that this happens at the microscopic level!!

Thanks for helping!!!

Cheers,

Daniel

This is a brilliant application of Crowdcrafting. It seems to me to tick
all the boxes.
* Everyone can understand the point - does normal gravity attract antimatter
* The task is simple to understand - mark the tracks of particles (since
they are straight it's easy to construct the app - start and endpoints
* Humans are better than machines at doing this
* There is a nice 3D output of the contributed tracks so you can
immediately see what you have contributed. Patterns of similar lines are
evident (I assume that is due to multiple contributors?)

Is there a discussion group for it? There are some questions I would like
to ask about the experiment and I expect others might as well. For example
are our points used as data or as an initial step to define the regions to
analyze in more detail?

I shall try to find time to blog it - it deserves wide publicity

Yes, and it is really beautiful because you can see the tracks reported by
all the volunteers that cluster themselves around it :-)

Not yet, but we will soon :-) We are working on it, hehe. Regarding your
question, if I'm not mistaken these tracks will be used to analyze again
those areas and see what is going on.

I can put you in contact with Michael Doser about this specific issue, he
will be happy to answer your questions.

I think this is a good example of the value of a mail list and then Michael

Dear all,

The Open Economics Working Group would like to
introduce<http://openeconomics.net/2013/08/07/introducing-the-open-economics-principles/>the
Open
Economics Principles <http://openeconomics.net/principles/>, a Statement on
Openness of Economic Data and Code. A year and a half ago the Open
Economics project
began<http://blog.okfn.org/2012/02/23/alfred-p-sloan-foundation-funds-open-economics-working-group-at-the-open-knowledge-foundation/>with
a mission of becoming central point of reference and support for those
interested in open economic data. In the process of identifying examples
and ongoing barriers for opening up data and code for the economics
profession, we saw the need to present a statement on the guiding
principles of transparency and accountability in economics that would
enable replication and scholarly debate as well as access to knowledge as a
public good.

We wrote the Statement on the Open Economics Principles during our
First<http://openeconomics.net/events/workshop-dec-2012/>and
Second <http://openeconomics.net/events/workshop-june-2013/> Open Economics
International Workshops, receiving feedback from our Advisory
Panel<http://openeconomics.net/about/advisory-panel/>and community
with the aim to emphasise the importance of having open
access to data and code by default and address some of the issues around
the roles of researchers, journal editors, funders and information
professionals.

Please, endorse the Principles! We appreciate your participation and
support.

Hi everyone,

I've created a Google Group for this project, as CERN cannot host it rather
quickly. Michael Doser will be joining us soon, so feel free to ask any
question.

https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cern-antimatter-crowdcrafting

All the best,

Daniel

*John Castellani, President and CEO, Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America*

1.     *In 2011, 80% of medicines in development were researched and tested
in US and in EU.*

2.     *The costs to develop new medicines continue to increase and global
ecosystem grow more hostile to innovation.*

Javier,
Is there a link/source for that list from Castellani? Google's just giving
me self-referentials. I'm in need of discovering a meaning for the
statement "global

Dear all,

I'm really happy to announce that CERN has officially tweeted about the
application here:

https://twitter.com/CERN/status/365442111413305344

And that they have posted a blog post about the application here:

http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2013/08/join-dots-measure-antimatter

James Doherty, the writer of the blog post has also published in the
Quantum Diaries:

http://www.quantumdiaries.org/2013/08/08/join-the-dots-to-measure-antimatter/

Enjoy!!!

Daniel

If you are epileptic, perhaps best to skip this bit.*

Even for non-epileptic users this is very annoying.  Why not just fix the
animation so it doesn't clear the screen between every frame?

Hi Tom,

We are using Kinetic.JS and in principle it should handle that correctly,
as we are using the Animation
constructor<http://kineticjs.com/docs/Kinetic.Animation.html>,
that does that precisely (or at least, it should be like that as the images
are loaded in an HTML5 canvas). Interestingly, this works really well on
Firefox (no flickering at all) but not in Chrome (sometimes it works, and
we don't know why).

We will probably remove the movie UI in any case, as we might want to give
more control to the users for analyzing the tracks (see discussion at
Google Groups<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cern-antimatter-crowdcrafting>
).

Cheers,

Daniel

Subject: [open-science] CrowdCrafting.org helping the SolarMal project: a
 new innovative mosquito trapping technologies for malaria control
Message-ID: <CAGS_vfoFODwjaeun5Pj9FAv2TGhLakM8Urc-RXy2K28jmz1EJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

Today a new application developed by the Public Health Computing group from
Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute in Basel has released a new
CrowdCrafting application!

The application needs your help to geo-locate the houses of the Rusinga
Island, an island in Lake Victoria, Western Kenya. These locations will be
used to  to inform the project logistics and analysis of the SolarMal
project <http://www.malariajournal.com/content/11/S1/O45>.

The tasks are really simple and you can help a lot!

Here is the official Tweet about it:
https://twitter.com/PyBossa/status/366900989611085825

And the paper about the project:
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/11/S1/O45

Cheers,

Daniel

PS: This application is really interesting because it uses the Bing aerial
data from Microsoft ;-) In principle they do not have the same
"restrictions" as Google with the number of requests!

Did you try preloading the images into multiple image objects instead of
changing the src url of a single image object? Scaling the images server
side instead of in the browser? Asking the KineticJS folks for advice?

Even something as simple as displaying the animation on a black background
instead of a bright white background would greatly reduce the
headache/epilepsy inducing strobing (ie use black for the canvas background
color instead of transparent).

I agree that scrubbing controls are desirable from a UI point of view, but
you're probably still going to want some type of movie mode, particularly
when users are drawing/adjusting the endpoints of the tracks.  If you
render the lines/endpoints in a fashion that doesn't obscure the image
(open circles for endpoints, dotted/dashed lines), it'll make it easier for
users to see how accurately their line matches the track.

We look into different options, but as we were in a hackton and we only had
48 hours we choose the easiest solution for the very first prototype :-) We
will be asking the KineticJS folks for advise, as this seems to be a
problem with our code and there should be a solution for this issue.

That's a really good advise! Thanks!

Thanks again. It makes a lot of sense what you have said! We will add open
circles and dashed or dotted lines as you said ;-)

To:


Dear Sir/Madame!
The ongoing project ?Policy RECommendations for Open Access to Research
Data in Europe? (RECODE - http://recodeproject.eu/) will leverage existing
networks, communities and projects to address challenges within the open
access and data dissemination and preservation sector and produce policy
recommendations for open access to research data based on existing good
practice.
One of these challenges are the technological barriers to Open Access and
Preservation of Research Data, and the possible solutions adopted to
mitigate them.
We have identified you as a person engaged or interested in the movement
for open access to research data and would therefore kindly ask you to
assist us with the objective of identifying the technological
infrastructural requirements for Open Access to Research Data in Europe by
filling out this questionnaire:
http://goo.gl/3KRu2k

Thank you very much for your time!

Hi Joe and David

Great idea! I'm copying in the open science and open access mailing lists
as well, Mike Taylor who is a member of these lists started a site called
Who Needs Access? http://whoneedsaccess.org/ containing interviews and
features on people who have been hindered by a lack of access to research
(as well as those who have been helped by open access). Perhaps there might
be scope for combining our efforts and helping out on your initiative!

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] Save the date: OKCon satellite event Geneva,
	19 Sept 2013
Message-ID: <CANACerHpP-1mvjgKUtO+P6DSG1tKfsVz-3mE_BaM6BhnXxiWZw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I hope you've enjoyed a beautiful summer and vacation :)

As you may remember, the idea of organizing an OKCon satellite event for
Open & Citizen Science enthusiasts stemmed a few months ago. We had a few
community calls since then, and the OKCon program curators helped us make
such an event reality!

*Save the date!* The Open & Citizen Science satellite event will take place
on 19 Sept, in Geneva. You can get further details from the event's
description: http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-b/

*Event content*: this day is what we make out of it :) You are more than
welcome to submit your ideas through the dedicated form (
http://openscience.alpine-geckos.at/projects/okcon-openscience-hackathon-submission/).
We'll update you weekly with the new submissions. Also, a community
call
is scheduled for next Thursday, September 5, 4pm CEST, if you are willing
to discuss, narrow down ideas, etc.

*Accommodation in Geneva*: there are still several subsidies left! Check
http://okcon.org/accommodation-subsidies/ for more info and contact details
for booking. This is a great possibility to stay in Geneva without ruining
yourself -- and to attend the satellite event ;)

Looking forward to meeting you in Geneva!
Rayna & Stefan
