Thanks Peter. Can I urge anyone interested in Open Access/Open Science/Open
Data ext to give this a look. Lend us one FB/Twitter status and you can
help track when people all over the world are denied access to research.

Message-ID: <CAPRuq1NBrW2H9m5qOOM2+i5UwRKAtQjy5HR+rRQf7OJVDEGaiA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,
Few updates of OKFn Bangladesh.

** OKFN BD involve with Society for the Popularization of Science,
Bangladesh (SPSB) recently. This organization work with science all over
the country. Last May 31 & June 1, 2013 SPSB arrange a two days long
national children science congress (http://www.cscongress.org/). Recently
SPSB got International Junior Science Olympiad (IJSO) membership. Now every
year SPSB able to send student this competition. From now OKFN Bangladesh
work with this science project as partner.

** In Bangladesh we now face so much political crises. Till now we pass
60-hr long strike in all over the country. So we not arrange any public
event this time. But we now work with social media. We try to increase our
social media activities. Like Facebook, twitter & try to collaborate some
our minded organization to promote Open Knowledge, Open Source etc.

Thank you all.

Subject: ï»¿ESWC 2014 Second Call for Workshops
Message-ID: <mailman.12.1383669699.21744.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Second Call for Workshops ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-workshops

The organizers of the 11th ESWC 2014 cordially invite you to submit a workshop proposal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and Linked Data, attracting a high number of high quality submissions and participants from academia and industry alike.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points for discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantic technologies and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technology of general interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of workshop proposals on:
 
* Fundamental problems of the Semantic Web / Linked Data such as ontology mining, heterogeneity, scalability and distribution, uncertainty, etc.
* Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
* Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the Semantic Web, and
* Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far, 
* Techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research (e.g., machine learning, NLP, data mining)



# General Information and Criteria 

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the local and the general chair of ESWC 2014.
 
The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:
 
* Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC conference.
* Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-conferences.
* We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
* Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application.
* There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's topic.
* Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
* We strongly advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.
 
In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the overall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less than 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early registration deadline might be canceled.
 
The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers), and proceedings production. They will be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chair and the ESWC 2014 local organizers to finalize all organizational details. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for workshops and tutorials at the pre-conference days, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fee.



# Important Dates 

Workshop proposals due: Nov 22, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time 
Notification of acceptance: Dec 6, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Workshop Web site due: Dec 16, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time 
Workshop camera-ready proceedings due: Apr 25, 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Workshop days: May 25 and May 26, 2014



# Suggested Timeline for Workshops

Submission deadline: March 6, 2014 
Notifications: April 1, 2014
Camera ready version: April 15, 2014



# Submission Guidelines 

Workshop proposals have to be submitted via Easychair. Each proposal must consist of a single PDF document written in English, not longer than 3 pages, which contains the following information:
 
1. The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying its goals and motivation.
2. A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
3. A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, the workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
4. A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, hacking session, or general discussion, and and an approximate timeline.
5. A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
6. An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day event.
7. Related Workshops and Conferences: Is this the continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop to address an emerging issue? Please provide information about past versions of this workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
8. Names and contact information of the workshop organizers/chair(s) (name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the workshop including past experience in organizing/facilitating workshops). Preferably a single contact person per submission.

The best papers of each workshop will be included in the supplementary proceedings of ESWC 2014, which will appear in the Springer LNCS series.

Message-ID: <51776B48-A4E5-41E8-99B8-D93B8600AE6F@gmail.com>

Hi!

I've started a collaborative document on new scientific markup languages:
https://hackpad.com/New-scientific-markup-language-utAjFcYuvvB
as it seems that there is a lot of people interested in, and writing about, it.

Let's gather the most important points  and brainstorm!

I guess you know a lot more:
* ideas,
* pros/cons of using LaTeX/Markdown/...,
* proposals for syntax,
* blog posts or discussions (maybe you wrote one?),
* implementations (working or in progress).  

So, feel invited to contribute!
And once again, I only made a stub, so feel free to add anything, not only - comment.

Regards,
Piotr

Subject: [open-science] citing a code and data on a GitHub repository
Message-ID: <6BD51EE4-B485-49A4-944F-2075B83281AC@gmail.com>

Hi!

Does any of you know what is the preferred way to cite code (placed on GitHub)? 

I saw the question here:
http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/14010/how-do-you-cite-a-github-repository

Also, a similar question (i.e. citing things not being journal publications) for  OEIS: 
http://mathoverflow.net/questions/131245/how-to-cite-a-sequence-from-the-on-line-encyclopedia-of-integer-sequences-oeis

Do you know what is "good practice"?
Is there some (perhaps informal) place trying to standardize the format (e.g. in BibTeX) or in general worth looking for a reference? 

Regards,
Piotr

A mix of BibJSON fields can probably *describe* such a reference
satisfactorily in a machine-friendly format. http://www.bibjson.org/

If I had to do it in my own work, I'd work up from that, trying to make
sure it's consistent with whatever format I'm using for the rest of the
bibliography (e.g. IEEE). Most of them have some measure of support for "a
thing with a URL". I realise that's not ideal though, and BibJSON is only
good as far "what pieces of information do I put in" goes, not, say,
formatting them.

Greetings,
Emanuil

Message-ID: <mailman.20.1384195528.21744.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Second Call for Tutorials ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-tutorials

ESWC 2014 invites tutorials that address the interests of its varied audience: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web researchers and practitioners that wish to learn new technologies, users of Semantic Web technologies, and representatives of government and funding agencies as well as potential private investors in Semantic Web technologies. We welcome submissions of tutorial proposals on all major topics related to semantic technologies.

We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:

- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new semantic technologies and trends.
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in specific domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce, cultural heritage, etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research especially in relationship to the tracks of the conference (e.g., techniques from social science, database techniques, NLP techniques etc.).

Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.

We advise having more than one presenter and no more than three, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the tutorial topic.

Tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects; however, we encourage organisers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The tutorials should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its relevance to the community.    

Timeline for Tutorials
-----------
Proposals due: Nov 22, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Notification of acceptance: Dec 6, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial Web site due: Dec 16, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Camera-ready material due: Apr 25, 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial days: May 25 and May 26, 2014

Responsibilities
-----------
Organizers of accepted tutorials are responsible for preparing and maintaining a Web site that describes the tutorial and includes all relevant information. Organizers are also responsible for submitting the material for attendees (slide sets, additional teaching material, software installation and usage guides for practical hands-on sessions, etc.) to the Tutorial Chair. The ESWC 2014 Organizing Committee is responsible for providing publicity for the tutorials as part of the conference publicity activities, and on-site logistical support to the organizers and attendees. Tutorial attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.


General Information
-----------
Each tutorial will have one reduced registration fee (pre-conference days registration will be free i.e. one of the chairs will only have to pay the main conference fees).
In the interest of the overall quality of the conference, the Tutorial Chair reserves the right to merge tutorials and/or adjust the scope thereof in case a mimimum number of registrations is not reached by the early registration deadline.

Submission details
-----------
Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages, using an 11 pt font for the body of the text of the proposal and should contain the following information:

- Abstract (200 words maximum, for inclusion on the ESWC 2014 website).

- Tutorial description: More specifically, it should specify the objectives of the tutorial and relevance to ESWC 2014, include enough details on the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered and specify the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge. Appropriate references to the material to be covered by the tutorial must be included.

- Tutorial length. The tutorial can be full or half day (if the tutorial can be either length, please be sure to identify which material is included for each length).

- Specify other venues to which the tutorial or part thereof has or will be presented, in addition to explaining how the current tutorial differs from the other editions. Links to the slides of those tutorial editions should be included in the proposal.

- Brief professional biography of the presenter(s) indicating previous training and speaking experience (such as teaching and tutorial presentation).

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the tutorial programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the tutorial's fit to the conference. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal. 

Submission
-----------
Submission will be through the Easychair system (please note that it is the same site to submit workshops and tutorials)  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials

Message-ID: <52816985.5080701@stefankasberger.at>

Hey,

During the actual project Open Science @ Uni Graz, we want to make Open
Science in Austria more visible.
So we've started to make a list of Open Science in Austria, from
Scientists to Open Source Projects over Scientific Open Data to research
in any of the various open science related fields.

So, if you know Open Science activities, like developing Open Source
tools for research, promoting Open Research or sharing open research
data and so on, please share it with us. There will be an blog post
about this afterwards, where we will try to map most of the open science
activities in austria.

Cheers, Stefan

For open-access activities in Austria, see the library for the tag
"oa.austria" in the Open Access Tracking Project. You can also subscribe to
an RSS version of this feed through the "export" link in the upper right
corner of the page.
http://tagteam.harvard.edu/hubs/3/tag/oa.austria

If you want to follow the developments in another country, just replace
"oa.austria" in the URL above with another tag, such as "oa.brazil",
"oa.china", "oa.denmark", and so on. Likewise if you want to follow the
developments in a field, such as "oa.anthropology", "oa.biology", or
"oa.chemistry".

The "oa.austria" tag library is not complete, but it should be a good
start. If anyone at Open Science @ Uni Graz wants to help *build* the feed
by tagging OA developments in Austria, I'd be happy to say more about how
to do that.

     Best,
     Peter

I'd be keen to promote Open Content-mining - Jenny Molloy has invited me to
present at Open-science Oxford later this month and I shall show some
tools. I'm still hoping to come to Austria and if so would be happy to
repeat and build on that...

I saw some discussion happening about this on one of the software-carpentry
mailing lists, but since those aren't for the general world, more
discussion could happen here or on the sci tech mailing list I created for
people to discuss technical details and implementation ideas for tools they
work on.

Here's a conversation I posted and then a good reply from Aron Ahmadia. The
WSSPE workshop is coming up, and he suggested reading through the
contributions on citation.

BibJSON is more of format. But I didn't know that, Emanuil, thanks for mentioning!

Also I got (from Rainere Silva) a link to a nice discussion on the topic:
http://lists.software-carpentry.org/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2013-October/001048.html

Sheila, thanks for pointing to another discussion.

Dear all,

data sharing arrangements have always been part of large research
projects, but I am not aware of any Data Sharing Agreement having open
data as the default.

If you know of such a document or have suggestions as to useful
phrasing - especially within the context of EU projects - I would
appreciate notice.

Thanks and cheers,

Daniel

Subject: [open-science] ESWC 2014 Second Call for Papers
Message-ID: <mailman.1.1384784680.25833.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Second Call for Papers ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-papers

CFP: 11th ESWC Conference  2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org    
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Program Chairs:
- Claudia d'Amato (Department of Computer Science, University of Bari, IT)
- Fabien Gandon (Wimmics, Inria, I3S, CNRS, University of Nice Sophia Antipolis, FR)

ESWC is a A rank conference according to CORE classificarion and a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and technology innovations related to the Semantic Web. The 11th edition of ESWC will take place from May 25th, 2014 to May 29th, 2014 in Anissaras, Crete, Greece. Besides a main focus on advances in Semantic Web research and technologies, ESWC 2014 is seeking to broaden its attention to span other relevant research areas in which Web semantics plays an important role.

The goal of the Semantic Web is to create a Web of knowledge and services in which the semantics of content is made explicit and content is linked to both other content and services. This arrangement of knowledge-based functionalities is weaving together a large network of human knowledge, and making this knowledge machine-processable to support intelligent behaviour by machines. Additionally, it supports novel applications allowing content from heterogeneous sources to be combined in unforeseen ways and support enhanced matching between users needs, software functionalities and online content.

Creating such an interlinked Web of knowledge which bridges between heterogeneous content and services requires collaboration between several computer science domains. Also, within this hybrid space that the Web has become, where humans and software interact in a complex manner, fundamentally requires an inter-disciplinary approach to find novel solutions to the problems generated.    

ESWC 2014 will feature twelve thematic research tracks (see below) and an in-use and industrial track. Submissions of interdisciplinary research papers, covering more than one thematic track, are also encouraged. In addition, the in-use and industrial track will provide an opportunity for dialogue and discussion on industrial applications, tools, deployment experiences, case studies and usage analysis.

Submitted papers should describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation. We strongly encourage and appreciate the submission of papers incorporating links to data sets and other material used for evaluation as well as to live demos and software source code.


We therefore encourage submissions addressing several conference research topics. However, each paper should be associated with at least one of the topics of the conference. The main research topics this year are:
- Vocabularies, Schemas, Ontologies;
- Reasoning;
- Linked Open Data;
- Social Web;
- Web Science;
- Data Management, Big data, Scalability;
- Natural Language Processing;
- Information Retrieval;
- Machine Learning;
- Mobile Web;
- Sensors;
- Streams;
- Services, processes, and cloud computing.

Additional special research topics this year are:
- Cognition and Semantic Web;
- Policies, Rights, Governance;
- Semantic multimedia web.


*Important Dates*

Abstract submission: Wednesday 8th January 2014 (sharp) - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Full-paper submission: Monday 13th January 2014 (sharp) - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Authors' Rebuttals: Wednesday 19th-Friday 21 Feb 2014
Acceptance notifications: Wednesday 26 February 2014
Camera-ready papers: Monday 10th of March 2014


*Submission  Information*

ESWC2014 welcomes the submission of original research and application papers dealing with all aspects of representing and using semantics on the Web. We encourage theoretical, methodological, empirical, and applications papers. The proceedings of this conference will be published in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

This year three of the best papers presented at the conference will have the opportunity to submit an extended version to a special issue of the journal "Semantic Web - Interoperability, Usability, Applicability" (IOS Press).

Papers should not exceed fifteen (15) pages in length and must be formatted according to the information for LNCS authors. Papers must be submitted in PDF (Adobe's Portable Document Format) format. Papers that exceed 15 pages or do not follow the LNCS guidelines will be automatically rejected without a review. Authors of accepted papers will be required to provide semantic annotations for the abstract of their submission - details of this process will be given on the conference Web page at the time of acceptance. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference. More information about the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) are available on the Springer LNCS Web site (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors).

Submissions and reviewing will be supported by the EasyChair system: https://www.easychair.org/account/signin.cgi?conf=eswc2014

Subject: [open-science] ESWC 2014 Call for PhD Symposium
Message-ID: <mailman.3.1384785962.25833.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Call for PhD Symposium ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/phd-symposium

The ESWC 2014 PhD Symposium is a chance for PhD students working in all areas of Semantic Web research to present their work, meet with peers and experienced researchers, obtain feedback and learn from each other's experiences. It aims at helping future researchers in building up the skills and confidence required to conduct and promote their research, as well as providing them with an opportunity to attend one of the most important research conferences on the Semantic Web.
 
The ESWC PhD Symposium will give to students the opportunity to:
1. Learn from a mentor: Established researchers and PhD student advisors will provide direct feedback. Each selected student will be assigned a member of the programme committee with whom they will interact on the revision of the paper and the preparation of the presentation.
2. Learn about research in general: Doing good research goes beyond writing a good paper; it includes perspectives on research as an endeavour and a career. Besides the presentations, coffee breaks and the PhD Symposium lunch will be used to exchange ideas and ask questions about all aspects of conducting a PhD and a research career in general.
3. Learn by constructive criticism: Thinking and writing about strengths and weaknesses of other research contributions shapes your own research capabilities.  As a participant to the PhD symposium, you will be expected to also review submissions from others, allowing you to juxtapose and learn from convergence and divergence of opinions.
4. Learn by presenting: Accepted contributions will be presented in the PhD symposium. All accepted contributions will also appear at the general poster session of ESWC. Students' posters will be presented alongside posters and demonstrations of the main conference.
 
Submissions will be considered from two different categories depending on the advancement into the PhD:
- Early Stage PhD: For students who may have identified the main research problem they want to address, the relevant literature, and are building their research methodology, but might not yet have obtained significant results, or only preliminary ones.
- Late Stage PhD: For students who have already defined their approach (even if incompletely) and obtained significant results (e.g., that might already have been published).
These categories do not affect the chances of being selected. They will however be taken into account by reviewers in their feedback, and in the length and format of the presentation. The organisers might decide to move a submission from one category to the other, if they think it is justified.


*Submission Information*

PhD students in all areas of Semantic Web research are invited to submit papers having 5 to 10 pages describing their PhD research, in the PDF format following the LNCS template. Submissions should be sent using the PhD Symposium submission system, through which participants will be also asked to decide on the category of their submission and to write a paragraph regarding their motivation for participating in the ESWC PhD Symposium.
 
Submissions should follow the following template of sections:
 
1. Introduction/Motivation
Give a general introduction to the domain/area/topic and indication of its importance/impact in Semantic Web research or other domains.

2. State of the Art
Describe existing work in the area, work focusing on the same/similar problems or that might be useful to realising your PhD.  

3. Problem Statement and Contributions
Based on motivation and state of the art, formulate the problem you intend to solve, and how you intend to contribute to Semantic Web research. This section should include a clear formulation of one (or very few) research hypothesis (what you will validate through your methodology, approach and evaluation) and the research questions that need to be answered. Late Stage PhD submissions should focus on contributions to such a hypothesis.

4. Research Methodology and Approach
Describe the research methodology you will apply in your research, including the different steps from the formulation of your research questions to answering them. Also describe the approach you are taking (or you intend to take for Early Stage PhD submissions) to instantiate the research methodology, hence contributing to solve the problem described in Section 3 and confirm or reject your hypothesis. Discuss how this approach is innovative and novel, and how it is (might be) implemented.

5. Preliminary or Intermediate Results
In a full conference paper, the approach would be fully described (in section 4) and fully evaluated (in section 6). Being at an intermediate stage, you should report here about the results achieved up to now in applying your approach that might not yet be sufficient for a full evaluation. .  

6. Evaluation Plan
Describe your evaluation plan, which is the way you intend to validate your hypothesis, your results, and the value of your approach. For Early Stage PhD submissions, this might be only partially defined, and details might be ommited. For Late Stage PhD submissions, you might have partial evaluation results.

7.Conclusion  
Describe how your results will or might impact research or the world at large.


*Important dates*
 
Submission deadline: 13th January 2014
Notification: 10th February 2014
Revised version of submission to mentor: 24th February 2014
Final version: 10th March 2014
Draft presentation to mentor: 12th May 2014

Subject: [open-science] Citizen Cyberscience Summit 2014: Call for workshops,
	papers and participation
Message-ID: <CABPM+wqgKv3qPP2wQDTHfgZm4jwKVb=F7xcgHsYvu8u+pxY=6A@mail.gmail.com>

                         *Following the successful Citizen Cyberscience
Summits in 2010 and 2012 (see http://cybersciencesummit.org/
<http://cybersciencesummit.org/>), we are pleased to announce a third
meeting in London on 20-22 February 2014*.

By citizen cyberscience, we refer to the wide range of activities that
enable people from all walks of life to join in scientific projects through
internet-based applications such as contributing the unused processing
power of their computers to help scientific computing, classifying
information, using their smartphones to collect nature observations or
building their own Internet-enabled sensors to collect environmental
information.

The summit will be structured as a 3-day event that offers scientists,
practitioners, enthusiasts, policy makers and citizen scientists the unique
opportunity to meet and discuss citizen science and citizen cyberscience,
participate in activities, and develop prototypes for new projects.

The first day (Thursday, 20th February 2014) will focus on the wide range
of citizen science activities, exploring the engagement, creativity and
participation, outreach of citizen science to the developing world, and the
undertaking of citizen science projects in challenging environments (e.g.
in a rainforest or the Arctic). We also welcome talks that deal with the
growing policy and environmental management implications of citizen science.

For the second day (Friday, 21st February 2014) we are calling for
presentations on the technical aspects of citizen science, such as: the
need for suitable hardware and software; or panels discussing with citizen
scientists about their perceptions, participation and engagement; or a
showcase of citizen science projects. Based upon the success of this event
in 2012, we will launch a ?think camp?/?hackfest?, which will carry on to
the next day and is aimed at developing demonstrations of hardware and
software that can be used in citizen science projects or simply a
concentrated discussion on a specific topic of interest.

The final day (Saturday, 22nd February 2014) will include further
conference sessions, workshops and development of prototypes, with an
afternoon talk, presentations and awards for the best prototypes.

Overall, we hope to cover a range of topics of relevance to citizen science
research, including: technical aspects of citizen science such as use of
sensors; applications of smartphones for data collection or in combination
with external sensors; linking the Internet of Things (IoT) and citizen
science ? sensor networks to human sensors; motivations, incentives and
engagement patterns; citizen science with indigenous and low-literacy
communities; social science, ethnographic and anthropological aspects of
citizen science and creativity and learning in citizen science.

During the summit, there will be an opportunity to present short papers,
run panels, organise workshops or provide showcase demonstrations. *We
would like to invite anyone interested in participating in this way to
submit brief proposals of up to 750 words using the form:

BioSharing and re3data.org cooperate on the collection and description of data repositories

Researchers need infrastructures that ensure a maximum of accessibility, stability and reliability in terms of working with and sharing data. Such infrastructures are being called research data repositories.

Today BioSharing and re3data.org - Registry of Research Data Repositories have agreed, in a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), to map and describe the emerging data repository landscape in a joint effort.

The cooperation between the partners will help to build a comprehensive overview of data repositories worldwide, to (i) assist users in the navigation and search of both services, and (ii) maximize cross-references and exchange of records between the two services. This cooperation aims at developing a vital ecosystem of research data repositories and at maximizing the accessibility of research data for scholarship and society.  

BioSharing is a registry of (i) community-developed, data and metadata reporting standards and (ii) databases linked to (iii) policies related to data preservation, management and sharing policies by funders and regulators in the life sciences (broadly covering biological, natural and biomedical sciences). BioSharing?s goal is to ensure these three type of resources are informative, discoverable and cross-linked, where appropriate, progressively adding metrics to monitor their use, development, evolution and integration. The description of the standards for describing and sharing life science experiments (minimal information checklists, terminologies and exchange formats) also leverages on the MIBBI portal - now part of this larger effort - and links to the entries in the BioPortal. Standards are progressively linked to public repositories described according to the bioDBcore community-defined description of their core attributes, leveraging on a collaboration with Nucleic Acids Research Database Issue and the DATABASE journals.
Website: http://www.biosharing.org

re3data.org - Registry of Research Data Repositories provides an overview on existing research data repositories. Since 2012re3data.org has indexed research data repositories offering researchers, funding organizations, libraries and publishers an overview of the heterogeneous research data repository landscape. Currently re3data.org lists over 600 research data repositories. Around 400 of these are described in detail using the re3data.org vocabulary. An innovative icon system helps researchers to easily identify an adequate research data repository for the storage of their research data. re3data.org is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Website: http://www.re3data.org

In the MoU both partners agree that for the life science communities, BioSharing will be the central submission point and service for data repositories, reporting standards and policies. For all other sciences, re3data.org will be the central submission point and service for data repositories.

To this purpose and as a first step of the cooperation re3data.orgwill integrate the database records from BioSharing, tracking provenance and progressively working together to ensure complementarity and harmonization of the metadata fields and icons.

Beyond that BioSharing and re3data.org will intensify their dialogue on common approaches and standards in the research data repository area.

Subject: [open-science] Data expedition idea - scholarly publishing income
Message-ID: <CABPM+wox4r9CXZikK_qia7KMzg8y7HjsrxYeduJ0WiSOQrL-wA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I wondered about a potential collaboration between School of Data and the
Open Science/Open Access working groups on a Data
Expedition<http://schoolofdata.org/category/data-expeditions/>around
scholarly publishers and their income.

The bottom line is some make a lot of profit, much of it from public
funding of higher education and research and possibly pay very little tax,
but there's not been much exploration of this beyond some figures on
profits which appear in blogs and a few articles and mostly in text and
tables.

It would be great to try and draw a more comprehensive dataset together,
visualise it and tell some stories.

Some figures:

>From Mike Taylor
http://svpow.com/2012/01/13/the-obscene-profits-of-commercial-scholarly-publishers/
 :

"Here they are again: profits as a percentage of revenue for commercial STM
publishers in 2010 or early 2011:

   - Elsevier: ?724m on revenue of ?2b ? 36%
   - Springer?s Science+Business Media: ?294m on revenue of ?866m ? 33.9%
   - John Wiley & Sons: $106m on revenue of $253m ? 42%
   - Academic division of Informa plc: ?47m on revenue of ?145m ? 32.4%"

Similar figures are also in Heather Morrison's thesis:
http://pages.cmns.sfu.ca/heather-morrison/chapter-two-scholarly-communication-in-crisis/

A few questions:

   1. Do you think this is a suitable topic for exploration?
   2. What are the thoughts of those who have run data expeditions or
   spending stories type projects before?
   3. Does anyone feel strongly about this and would like to coordinate the
   project?
   4. Would anyone like to help out? (could you host a workshop, are you
   organising an event or conference where this could run as a session, are
   you a data wrangler, visualisation expert, journalist, coder, accountant,
   researcher or anybody just interested in digging in?)

Reply to the list and sign up on the pad if so!

Subject: [open-science] ESWC 2014 Final Call for Tutorials
Message-ID: <mailman.1.1385056245.15933.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Final Call for Tutorials ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-tutorials

ESWC 2014 invites tutorials that address the interests of its varied audience: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web researchers and practitioners that wish to learn new technologies, users of Semantic Web technologies, and representatives of government and funding agencies as well as potential private investors in Semantic Web technologies. We welcome submissions of tutorial proposals on all major topics related to semantic technologies.

We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:

- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new semantic technologies and trends.
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in specific domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce, cultural heritage, etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research especially in relationship to the tracks of the conference (e.g., techniques from social science, database techniques, NLP techniques etc.).

Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.

We advise having more than one presenter and no more than three, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the tutorial topic.

Tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects; however, we encourage organisers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The tutorials should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its relevance to the community.    

Timeline for Tutorials
-----------
Proposals due: Nov 22, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Notification of acceptance: Dec 6, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial Web site due: Dec 16, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Camera-ready material due: Apr 25, 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial days: May 25 and May 26, 2014

Responsibilities
-----------
Organizers of accepted tutorials are responsible for preparing and maintaining a Web site that describes the tutorial and includes all relevant information. Organizers are also responsible for submitting the material for attendees (slide sets, additional teaching material, software installation and usage guides for practical hands-on sessions, etc.) to the Tutorial Chair. The ESWC 2014 Organizing Committee is responsible for providing publicity for the tutorials as part of the conference publicity activities, and on-site logistical support to the organizers and attendees. Tutorial attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.


General Information
-----------
Each tutorial will have one reduced registration fee (pre-conference days registration will be free i.e. one of the chairs will only have to pay the main conference fees).
In the interest of the overall quality of the conference, the Tutorial Chair reserves the right to merge tutorials and/or adjust the scope thereof in case a mimimum number of registrations is not reached by the early registration deadline.

Submission details
-----------
Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages, using an 11 pt font for the body of the text of the proposal and should contain the following information:

- Abstract (200 words maximum, for inclusion on the ESWC 2014 website).

- Tutorial description: More specifically, it should specify the objectives of the tutorial and relevance to ESWC 2014, include enough details on the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered and specify the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge. Appropriate references to the material to be covered by the tutorial must be included.

- Tutorial length. The tutorial can be full or half day (if the tutorial can be either length, please be sure to identify which material is included for each length).

- Specify other venues to which the tutorial or part thereof has or will be presented, in addition to explaining how the current tutorial differs from the other editions. Links to the slides of those tutorial editions should be included in the proposal.

- Brief professional biography of the presenter(s) indicating previous training and speaking experience (such as teaching and tutorial presentation).

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the tutorial programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the tutorial's fit to the conference. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal. 

Submission
-----------
Submission will be through the Easychair system (please note that it is the same site to submit workshops and tutorials) https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials

Message-ID: <mailman.3.1385056884.15933.open-science@lists.okfn.org>


** apologies for cross-posting **

==== Final Call for Workshops ====
http://2014.eswc-conferences.org/important-dates/call-workshops

The organizers of the 11th ESWC 2014 cordially invite you to submit a workshop proposal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and innovations in the field of semantic technologies on the Web and Linked Data, attracting a high number of high quality submissions and participants from academia and industry alike.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points for discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantic technologies and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technology of general interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of workshop proposals on:
 
* Fundamental problems of the Semantic Web / Linked Data such as ontology mining, heterogeneity, scalability and distribution, uncertainty, etc.
* Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
* Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the Semantic Web, and
* Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far, 
* Techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research (e.g., machine learning, NLP, data mining)



# General Information and Criteria 

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the local and the general chair of ESWC 2014.
 
The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:
 
* Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC conference.
* Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-conferences.
* We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
* Workshops should have a clear focus on a specific technology, problem or application.
* There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's topic.
* Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
* We strongly advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.
 
In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the overall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less than 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early registration deadline might be canceled.
 
The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website, timelines and call for papers), and proceedings production. They will be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chair and the ESWC 2014 local organizers to finalize all organizational details. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2014 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for workshops and tutorials at the pre-conference days, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fee.



# Important Dates 

Workshop proposals due: Nov 22, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time 
Notification of acceptance: Dec 6, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Workshop Web site due: Dec 16, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time 
Workshop camera-ready proceedings due: Apr 25, 2014 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Workshop days: May 25 and May 26, 2014



# Suggested Timeline for Workshops

Submission deadline: March 6, 2014 
Notifications: April 1, 2014
Camera ready version: April 15, 2014



# Submission Guidelines 

Workshop proposals have to be submitted via Easychair at https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2014workshops-tutorials. Each proposal must consist of a single PDF document written in English, not longer than 3 pages, which contains the following information:
 
1. The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying its goals and motivation.
2. A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.
3. A brief description of why and to whom the workshop is of interest, the workshop audience, as well as the expected number of participants.
4. A brief description (draft outline) of the proposed workshop format, discussing the mix of events and activities such as paper presentations, invited talks, panels, hacking session, or general discussion, and and an approximate timeline.
5. A list of (potential) members of the program committee (at least 50% have to be known and confirmed at the time of the proposal).
6. An indication of whether the workshop should be considered for a half-day or full-day event.
7. Related Workshops and Conferences: Is this the continuation of a workshop series or a new workshop to address an emerging issue? Please provide information about past versions of this workshop and other related workshops (including URLs and submission/acceptance counts, if available).
8. Names and contact information of the workshop organizers/chair(s) (name, affiliation, email address, homepage and short (one paragraph) biography of each chair, explaining the chair's expertise for the workshop including past experience in organizing/facilitating workshops). Preferably a single contact person per submission.

The best papers of each workshop will be included in the supplementary proceedings of ESWC 2014, which will appear in the Springer LNCS series.

I agree that this is very important. I have no first-hand experience, but
suggest that at least two publishers, OUP and CUP, as member departments ot
universities, will legally have to answer FOI requests for information. I
have no idea whether their profits are acceptable. We may be able to use
them as calibration/controls on things like:
* how many staff are employed in what departments
* what percentage of revenue is spent on X, Y, Z
* what profits are re-invested
* how much is spent on "public good" (e.g. running conferences)

I suspect a full investigation of a publisher may have to work on
externable observables (staff complement, local taxes, etc.) as well as
income (which may be difficult to determine).

Hi Jenny,

I'm not an economist, but I would definitely be curious to understand how
an economist interprets these observations (along with a bit more digging
of the type you suggest).

My understanding is that an efficient marketplace is supposed to erode
profit margins (not revenues). A single company can make large profits as
the result of innovations that put them well ahead of the competition, at
least for a period of time.  But it seems particularly unusual to see
sectors in which every major player is making a large profit margin. It
seems this would suggest to the economist that the marketplace was not
efficient, and thus not spurring innovation.

I'd be curious to hear from a more expert opinion if economists view this
as evidence of an inefficient market?  If so, how it has come about
(nondisclosure of prices? bundled subscriptions? something else?) What
would restore an efficient, competitive, innovative marketplace?

Beyond an academic study, I've also wondered if this issue would interest
investigative journalists such as the NPR Planet Money Team?

Cheers,

Carl

Hi Carl and all

[Cc'ing the open-economics and data-driven-journalism lists in the spirit
of fostering some cross working group collaboration. Please let me know if
this is too off-topic for your lists!]

Thanks for your responses, I agree these are all interesting questions and
we definitely seem short of expertise in economics so I have copied in the
open-economics list where hopefully some economists reside who might be
able to help us in responding to your comments.

Does anybody know of someone doing academic work on this already? The data
expedition format lends itself more to an investigative journalism type
approach, finding what data one can and building a narrative, so my initial
suggestion was not really around an academic study but I think both
approaches would be worthwhile.

If anyone on the ddj list would be interested (or has a contact who would),
please do come and join the discussion on the open-science list - we would
love to hear from you.

Jenny

Open Knowledge promotes fast, creative innovation across sectors

Knowledge Exchange delivers a discussion paper exploring the rich field of
open knowledge in order to help our partners effectively achieve their
objectives.

'Open knowledge' is the power to promote fast, creative innovation by
allowing an idea to leave your hands. Essentially, something is 'open' if
anyone is free to use, reuse and redistribute it. It should only be subject
to the requirement to the requirement to attribute the author, if even
that. Knowledge Exchange is exploring the rich field of open knowledge in
order to help our partners effectively achieve their objectives. To this
end, scoping sessions took place with experts which revealed strong views
on the value of making knowledge open and steps which need to be taken to
achieve this. These views are collected in the Knowledge Exchange
discussion paper on Open Knowledge<
http://www.knowledge-exchange.info/Admin/Public/DWSDownload.aspx?File=%2fFiles%2fFiler%2fdownloads%2fOpen+Knowledge%2fOpen_Knowledge_discussion_paper.pdf
>.
Mechanisms of open creation offer opportunities to work and exchange with
other sectors - research, cultural heritage and government. To make true
use of this collaboration we require an increase of openness, to create
better proposals and solutions. We simply cannot afford to not open up, we
need an open approach to tackle the challenges facing us.
Though we may be easily persuaded about the benefits of open, the practice
is different. People still hold knowledge to themselves or want to make
money from knowledge. The current competitive environment encourages
researchers and employees to seek protection against the theft of their
ideas, which they do by locking down work behind patents and intellectual
property rights. We need to enforce openness as there are not sufficient
incentives at present.
The experts agreed to not just go out making plans or spend time convincing
yourself that open is good.  Get out and about and show new things to
others - convince them there's another way.
The paper closes with suggestions for actions to take when publishing or
funding content.

The discussion paper is available at:

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEwQSWBrmMzPRLqjG3djxJZn3yrvDqpbtApz0pzE=2o0TQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

OKFN Labs have just launched a really cool new project highlighting bad
examples of data publishing as a way of learning from their mistakes.

The details of how to take part are here: http://okfnlabs.org/bad-data/add/
It's GitHub based and option 2 is very easy if you're not sure about option
1

I have nominated poor examples from
Nature: https://github.com/okfn/bad-data/issues/4
and Science: https://github.com/okfn/bad-data/issues/5

to kick it off.

If you happen to know of any other really bad examples of published,
accessible supplementary data do upload them! It would be good to see a
diversity of publishers represented.

Best,

Ross

Hi All

Apologies to those who are already on force11 and data publication mailing
lists, but I thought I would flag the publication of these principles to
anyone on this list who isn't and encourage you to comment on them.

We frequently cite a lack of incentive and formal credit for publishing
datasets as a reason why data publication doesn't happen often enough, so
it seems this in an important discussion to be having as a community of
data producers, consumer and re-users.

Subject: Data Citation Synthesis Group: Draft Declaration of Data Citation
Principles
To: DATA-PUBLICATION at jiscmail.ac.uk


The Data Citation Synthesis Group http://www.force11.org/node/4381 has
released a draft Declaration of Data Citation Principles
http://www.force11.org/datacitation and invites comment.

Although this has been announced already here, I wanted to make three
further points:

1) This has been a very interesting and positive collaborative process and
has involved a number of groups and committed individuals. Encouraging the
practice of data citation, it seems to me, is one of the key steps towards
giving research data its proper place in the literature.

As the preamble to the draft principles states:

Sound, reproducible scholarship rests upon a foundation of robust,
accessible data. For this to be so in practice as well as theory, data must
be accorded due importance in the practice of scholarship and in the
enduring scholarly record. In other words, data should be considered
legitimate, citable products of research. Data citation, like the citation
of other evidence and sources, is good research practice.

In support of this assertion, and to encourage good practice, we offer a
set of guiding principles for data citation.


2) Please do comment on these principles. We hope that with community
feedback and support, a finalised set of principles can be widely endorsed
and adopted.

*Discussion on a variety of lists is welcome, of course. However, if you
want the Synthesis Group to take full account of your views, please be sure
to post your comments on the discussion
forum http://www.force11.org/datacitation
<http://www.force11.org/datacitation>.*

3) I wanted to add here some notes and observations on the genesis of these
principles, which I have done on the CODATA blog:
http://codata.org/blog/2013/11/25/data-citation-synthesis-group-draft-declaration-of-data-citation-principles/-
I hope this background may be of interest.

Best wishes,

Simon.
