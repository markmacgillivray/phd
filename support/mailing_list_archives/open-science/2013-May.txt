FYI.

Do Dryad have require or encourage an open license for data depositors?

---------- Forwarded message ----------
We are delighted to announce some recent and upcoming developments at Dryad.


First, we recently launched a redesigned website at
http://datadryad.orgwith lots of new content.
Some of the highlights include:

   - Information about the recently announced submission fees and pricing
   plans which will become effective Sept. 2013:
   https://www.datadryad.org/pages/pricing

   to work on next, vote or comment on ideas submitted by others, and check
   back to see our responses:
https://datadryad.uservoice.com<https://datadryad.uservoice.com/forums/197408-general>
   - An Integrated Journals page that helps depositors see which journals
   are coordinating the submission process with Dryad, figure out which stage
   in the publication process to submit data for your chosen journal, and
   more: https://www.datadryad.org/pages/integratedJournals



Second, all Dryad members, prospective members, and interested parties are
invited to the first annual membership meeting in Oxford, UK on Friday, May
24. This is part of a series of exciting events in Oxford that week
spotlighting trends in scholarly communication with an emphasis on research
data, including a Symposium on the Now and Future of Data Publication on
Wednesday, May 22nd, and an ORCID Outreach Meeting with a special joint
Dryad-ORCID Symposium on Research Attribution on Thursday, May 23rd. Remote
attendance will be available.   For more information, please see:

Subject: [open-science] Science Europe policy statement on the transition to
	Open Access
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEy4BKNLofYaOp6VEkvipoXaUtMFsO0hx8fz6P2KFAYDdQ@mail.gmail.com>

In case you haven't seen this on Twitter yet...

Science Europe have released an excellent short, clear & agreeable policy
statement on the transition to OA here:
http://www.scienceeurope.org/downloads
direct link to PDF:
http://www.scienceeurope.org/uploads/Public%20documents%20and%20speeches/SE_OA_Pos_Statement.pdf

I'm delighted they've backed the strong RCUK-like stance of allowing an
embargo/delay of only 6 months for non-AHSS research.
It also supports all good approaches to open access regardless of 'gold' or
'green' distinction, except in the case of the 'hybrid model' which it
rightfully pours scorn on.

(from the PDF below)

The Science Europe Member Organisations have agreed on the following vision
and principles:

With regard to Open Access to research publications, Science Europe Member
Organisations share the view that:

? publication and dissemination of results are an integral part of the
research process. The allocation of
resources within the research system must take this into account;
? Open Access to the published results of publicly-funded research will
have huge value for the research
community and will offer significant social and economic benefits to
potential users in industry, charitable and
public sectors, to individual professionals, and to the general public;
? Open Access, as defined in the Berlin Declaration, is not only about the
right of access, but also about the
opportunity to re-use information with as few restrictions as possible,
subject to proper attribution;
? the common goal of Science Europe Members is to shift to a research
publication system in which free
access to research publications is guaranteed, and which avoids undue
publication barriers. This involves a
move towards Open Access, replacing the present subscription system with
other publication models whilst
redirecting and reorganising the current resources accordingly.
Science Europe is committed to playing a role in accomplishing the
transition to Open Access as quickly as
possible, in an efficient and sustainable way, and thus avoiding
unnecessary costs. This transition process
must be as co-ordinated and transparent as possible.

Therefore the Science Europe Member Organisations:

? will continue to support any valid approaches to achieve Open Access,
including those commonly referred
to as the ?green? and ?gold? routes;
? recognise repositories and related facilities as key strategic research
infrastructure which should comply with
high quality standards;
? stress that research publications should either be published in an Open
Access journal or be deposited as soon as possible in a repository, and
made available in Open Access in all cases no later than six months
following first publication. In Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, the
delay may need to be longer than six
months but must be no more than 12 months;
? require that as part of the publication services provided against the
payment of Open Access publication
fees, effective mechanisms are in place to ensure that the publication of
research outputs is subject to rigorous
quality assurance;
? will co-ordinate efforts to ensure the efficient and cost effective use
of public funds, and combine
programmes for covering Open Access costs with budget control mechanisms
and to build up monitoring
systems for these costs;
? accept that it is essential that Open Access transactions need to be
managed efficiently, with the
co-operation of all parties involved;
? require that funding of Open Access publication fees is part of a
transparent cost structure, incorporating a
clear picture of publishers? service costs;
? expect publishers to apply institutional-, regional-, or country-based
reductions in journal subscriptions, in
line with increases in author- or institution-pays contributions;
? stress that the hybrid model, as currently defined and implemented by
publishers, is not a working and viable
pathway to Open Access. Any model for transition to Open Access supported
by Science Europe Member
Organisations must prevent ?double dipping? and increase cost transparency;
? recognise that some redirection and reorganisation of current budgets
will be necessary. Governments
should give due consideration to the fact that public funds for journal
subscriptions often come from other
ministries or institutions than those directly responsible for funding
research; consequently, some rebalancing
of budgets may be required.

Science Europe wishes to encourage the European Commission, national
governments, research
funding and research performing organisations and other stakeholders across
the world to adopt
this approach to Open Access and to actively nurture collaboration in this
area.

I see your point Mike.

But in the context of the US OSTP policy, and many others allowing 12
months embargo, having another statement that says 6 months and NO MORE is
plenty enough - I'd say *in that context* it's pleasing.

Its going in the right direction towards: immediate open access (and
nothing less)

I agree . I'm a hardliner on this. It's our material - our research - we
created it without thought of personal financial reward.  6 months is
unacceptable.  The same happens with licences - every assumption that we
have to negotiate with publishers is an implicit concession. We have
absolute rights - we blundered many away but they are still rights and we
must fight for them.

Absolutely

Hi all,

This was tweeted, http://sciencehackday.com/ambassador

If any of you are going to host a science hack day this year or next
year, you can apply for a scholarship to go to a science hack day
ambassadorship even in San Francisco.

Timely...

Only a week after we launched a call for suggestions of Senior, Open
Scientists here:
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2013-April/002422.html

The Whitehouse (US) is now 'Seeking Outstanding ?Open Science? Champions of
Change'
http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/07/seeking-outstanding-open-science-champions-change

...asking for your help to identify ?Open Science? Champions of
Change?outstanding individuals, organizations, or research projects
promoting and using open scientific data for the benefit of society. For
example, a Champion?s work may involve:


   - Providing free access to data or publications generated from
   scientific research; or
   - Leading research that uses publically available scientific data.

Anyone can nominate an ?Open Science? candidate for consideration by May
14, 2013 (under ?Theme of Service,? choose ?Open Science?).

See their website for more details. Great to see Open Science being
nationally recognised and rewarded!

I posted the spreadsheet to G+, but forgot to come back and link to it
here.  You can find the discussion at:
https://plus.google.com/u/0/105251844408815803021/posts/22bCAxMTkaE and a
direct link to the spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak8syCNT8x2DdGZBd3JYeVppWldybFNkOVFrWHZwbkE&usp=sharing

There were 88 laureates in all and the spreadsheet includes nationalities
from Freebase, links to Wikipedia articles, and links to the original
letters.

Ross, Tom, everyone:

What a fantastic resource. Thanks for compiling this!

I do notice, however, that very few women have made their way onto the
list. I would encourage folks to nominate senior female scientists, as well.

Yes Stacy, the lack of female representation on the list is quite striking
and it's not something I'm too pleased with :S

So, yeah... If anyone has any nominations for established female open
scientists, I'd be delighted to include them.

Hi all,
I'm new on this list, sorry if we haven't met.
I would like to nominate Tracey Lauriault, of Carleton University in Ottawa.
Here are links to her web site and blog:
https://gcrc.carleton.ca/confluence/display/GCRCWEB/Lauriault
http://datalibre.ca/
She may not be "senior" but she has made great contributions to Open Science
and Open Data in Canada.
Should I add her to the spreadsheet?
Cheers
Ted Strauss

My first thought was that you don't have to nominate? just add the person to the spreadsheet, and perhaps add a column called "comments" in which you can add comments.

However, I just noticed the spreadsheet is "view" only, so I guess we have to nominate unless the spreadsheet is made editable.

Actually, I was able to add the entry, so maybe you just need to be logged
in to your google account.

You're welcome, but Peter Suber deserves credit for compiling the original
list of letters.

My spreadsheet is a simple compilation of the Nobel Laureates who signed
open letters to Congress in support of Open Access.  It doesn't have
anything to do with the Whitehouse nomination process and it is limited to
Nobel Laureates (and mostly U.S. nationals).

According to Freebase, of the 662 Nobel Laureates that it knows about, 635
are male and 27 are female (and that's across all categories, not just
science categories), so it's not surprising that the majority of the letter
signers were also male.

Dear all,****

** **

     As a reminder, tomorrow is the closing date for registering to
participate in person or remotely in the National Academy of Sciences
meeting on the White House directive for all federally funded journal
articles to be made publicly accessible.
http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DBASSE/CurrentProjects/DBASSE_082378#.UYkwuUp48mN
****

** **

     Topics to consider commenting on are the appropriate embargo period
and what reuse rights users should have.  The agency plans have to enable
users to read, download and ?analyze? the publications.  I believe
?analyze? means analyze computationally, which means enabling bulk download
for text mining purposes.  If others agree, that would be a useful point to
convey.****

** **

    In addition, I?m going to argue that the agencies should permit
republication of publicly accessible manuscripts on other websites.  As a
fallback, I think at a minimum institutional repositories should have the
rights to mirror the publicly accessible versions of the articles.  Even if
your repository would not currently have interest in doing so, think of
this as an insurance policy in the case that funding for public access
repositories dries up in the future.  If mirroring rights are part of the
plan, then the community can work together to maintain public access.
Again, if you agree, that would be a useful point to make as well.****

** **

Best,****

This is a great idea Ross
points
* suggest another word than "senior" - perhaps "outstanding".This is not an
age or status thing - it's about impact.
* emphasize people who both practice openness and work to spread it. And
particularly who fight for it. Ilaria Capua , an impressive Italian
virologist, she fought the established order to have sequences published.

Glad to see this thread. I always wondered where are top scientists to
voice in favor of open science. Or open knowledge in general!

Last year, whilst working at the Wikipedia Education Program, someone has
shown a video of scientists awarded with the Nobel prize supporting
Wikipedia, when I invited professors to make a video doing so. [1]

I tried to persuade people to make videos of prominent professors
supporting the idea of editing Wikipedia [2], but so far that didn't happen.

Congrats for the list made here! I hope it will help more scientist to
understand their responsibility.

Tom

I've added a quote column, perhaps we could get a one or two-liner from
those on the spreadsheet who are already here on open-science (there's a
few of you!) about why they advocate open science. If you know anyone on
the list and could nudge them to provide a quote that would be great,
because we can do a nice display on the website and it would act as a
useful resource for people writing about open science.

Equally, if you come across a quote elsewhere you can just post that up
with a link.

Subject: [open-science] Data sharing at the European Medicines Agency
Message-ID: <6796DAEEAC23394783E9B5A1B75F9A7E0A6B78C5@MS10.lsc.net>

Hello all,

We rarely seem to have discussions of open data in medicine - where, in my opinion, the benefits are most tangible - so am sharing a link to a blog about recent events at the European Medicines Agency. The Agency seems far from implementing an OKF-compliant open data policy but is establishing a process to allow greater access - "proactive publication", whatever that means - to data supporting drug license applications in the EU.

My blog/report is here:
http://blog.f1000.com/2013/05/07/one-step-forward-for-better-evidence/

And within the recently-published, widely-sought advice to the EMA (I was amongst ~200 contributors) there are some issues relevant to the open science community now.

Such as, copyright, sui generis database rights, and Creative Commons CC0 (Dryad, figshare are mentioned) for data - within the legal discussions document: http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2013/04/WC500142857.pdf

Also, data standards and formats (unfortunately some interested parties continue to recommend PDF for some data):
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Other/2013/04/WC500142850.pdf

And probably others within the documents, http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/news_and_events/news/2013/04/news_detail_001778.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058004d5c1

See my blog for further thoughts. I encourage the open science community to read and comment on the EMA's draft policy when it is published next month. This is a chance to make medical evidence - albeit slowly - better with more open science.

Best regards,

Iain

Strapline, "Hacking academia better together"
There's an interesting hack event being held in London on Saturday 6th July
you might want to attend:

The goals of the event are:


   - Demonstrate the value of the CC-BY licence within academia. We are
   interested in supporting innovations around and on top of the literature.
   - Reach out to academics who are keen to learn or improve their
   programming skills to better their research. We?re especially interested in
   academics who have never coded before.

Do note the 2nd point. You don't need to be a coder :)

The event is being run by Jason (from PeerJ) and Ian (from eLife), with
sponsorship from: PLOS, eLife, Amazon Web Services, PeerJ & Skills Matter
(in no particular order). Registration for the event (?1) is here:
http://hack4ac.eventbrite.co.uk/

I've signed down already.

Best,

Ross

Hi Liang,


This is really cool. Thanks for sharing it with us.

I'm copying your message across the to open-science and open-access mailing
lists because I think they might also be interested in this.

I'd like to see the Publisher details added, as well as DOI range (hard!).
There's a whole load of OA journals & their RSS feeds we could add from
DOAJ with a bit of data munging I think.

Very promising...

Ross

Hello,

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjfpjwzLd5bUdEY5MF9KUmROaW1WZklOYmoweEtZakE&usp=sharing
is a list of 14266 journals' feed from http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/
several years ago and they've stopped releasing it.

I think it will be very useful to have a crowdsourcing platform like
wikipedia for academic journals, so I imported this list into Drupal.
http://shenzhuxi.com/journals is a quick prototype and I'd like to
hear more suggestions.

wikijournal.org seems to be the best domain name but it's not available.

More fields like website url, impact factor (not sure about the
copyright), publication frequency, Open Access, RSS/ATOM and etc. will
be good to be added and maintained by the community.

Also It will be nice to dump all the journal feed items from Google
Reader (https://code.google.com/p/pyrfeed/wiki/GoogleReaderAPI) and
collect regularly in the future. Since Google Reader will be closed
soon, I talked about the historical data with JournalTOCs
https://twitter.com/JournalTOCs/status/312180502184476672, but they
don't have.

First Workshop on "Linking and Contextualizing Publications and Datasets"

Valletta, Malta, September 26th, 2013
Web site: http://lcpd2013.research-infrastructures.eu/
E-mail: lcpd2013 at isti.cnr.it

In conjunction with TPDL 2013 (http://www.tpdl2013.info)
*******************************************************************

###### Workshop Objectives ######

The goal of this workshop is to provide researchers and practitioners in the fields of Digital Libraries, e-Science, and e-Research, with a forum where they can constructively explore foundational, organizational and systemic challenges in contexts having publishing, interlinking, preservation, discovery, access, and reuse of publications and datasets as focal points. It expects to contribute to the actual picture of the state of the art approaches and solutions that researchers and practitioners active in these fields have investigated and realized. 

###### Workshop topics ######

The workshop welcomes submissions reporting on theoretical, systemic, and foundational work targeting popular topics of linking and contextualizing datasets and publications. The topics of this workshop are of interest to, but not limited to, the following research avenues:

- Metadata formats for publications and datasets: interlinking or contextualizing research outputs.
- Metadata access services: exporting/discovering metadata to facilitate interlinking or contextualizing research outputs.
- Data models expressing relationships between publications, datasets and other information apt for re-use, contextualization, etc.
- Aggregation services: robust and scalable collection, integration, storage, interlinking, and visualization of heterogeneous objects and metadata from publication, dataset, and contextual content data sources
- Linking and contextualization services: processing/mining interlinked objects and metadata relative for enrichment, disambiguation, annotation
- Future publication models and services: novel concepts and management of ?enhanced publications?, ?research objects?, ?executable papers?.

For more on these topics, please visit the workshop website.

###### Important Dates ######

Research paper submission: June 24th, 2013
Notification of acceptance: July 29th, 2013
Camera ready version: August 31st, 2013

###### Paper Submission ######

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished research papers. Submitted manuscripts will have to be in PDF or Word, limited to 8 pages, written in english and following the guidelines for the LNCS format provided by Springer (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0). 

The call for papers will invite authors to submit original, unpublished research papers. Submitted manuscripts will have to be limited to 8 pages, following the guidelines for the LNCS format provided by Springer. Preferred formats are PDF or Microsoft Word. Submission is on line at: https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lcpd2013 (EasyChair on-line system: you need to register an account to submit).

Papers submitted to the workshop will undergo a single-blind peer-review process by Program Committee members. To be published on the proceedings, accepted contributions should be revised according to the reviews and at least one author is required to register and present the paper at the workshop.

Proceedings, including abstracts from the invited speakers and the revised papers, will become a publication with ISBN (the organisers are in the process of selecting the publisher).

Possibly.

I have a gist of 1176 CC BY licensed OA journals and their ISSN's here. No
RSS feeds for them though: https://gist.github.com/rossmounce/5083733

Have you thought about using Crowdcrafting to get people to add details,
rather than drupal?
e.g. something like this: http://crowdcrafting.org/app/oajournals/
It might be prettier...



> I just added OA or not field,
>

Cool. I hope you're using the BOAI definition of OA? A lot of journals
online are just 'free access' rather than explicitly open access I'm
afraid, and it's tricky to work out which is which. I suggest you change
that field to 'free access' (Y/N) to reduce complexity.

Hi Ross,

If you're looking for a tool to aggregate a large number of journal RSS
feeds, especially in a way that supports social tagging, I can recommend
TagTeam, an open-source project I launched in 2011. Since the fall of 2012,
the Open Access Tracking Project has run on TagTeam. Here's my short
introduction to the software; I'd be happy to say more if you'd like.

it hits one of the addressee listservs. But for direct correspondence,
please use <peter.suber at gmail.com> or <psuber at cyber.law.harvard.edu>.

publishers owning DOI prefixes registered with CrossRef are listed at
http://www.crossref.org/06members/50go-live.html .

I am not aware of a similar listing for prefixes registered elsewhere.

Adding to Cameron's post, this quote from the DOI site (http://www.doi.org ? in particular http://www.doi.org/doi_handbook/2_Numbering.html item 2.2) may be relevant:

In use, the DOI name is an "opaque string" or "dumb number" ? nothing at all can or should be inferred from the number in respect of its use in the DOI system. The only secure way of knowing anything about the entity that a particular DOI name identifies is by looking at the metadata that the Registrant of the DOI name declares at the time of registration. This means, for example, that even when the ownership of a particular item changes, its identifier remains the same ? in perpetuity. This is why the DOI name is called a "persistent identifier".

Certain prefixes are granted to publishers but the DOIs are attached to papers, not publishers, thus if a journal moves publishers then the DOIs go with it. Similarly (although I don't think this has happened in practice) a publisher might get a new prefix.

For instance BMC DOIs appear to made up of the BMC prefix (10.1186) the journal ISSN and the volume and "page number". You can't count through these. And of course BMC is owned by Springer so who is the "publisher" in this case?

We have done this for crystallographic papers (
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/summary/index.html ) where we have
trawled the exposed metadata (PubCrawler, NickDay/SamAdams, open source)
for publisher/journal/issue/article hierarchy using the publisher ToCs.
This couldn't be definitive (i.e. in a court) but it's good enough for most
people. As long as publishers provide  online ToCs then we can do this
fairly easily technically.

Hey All,

I thought some you of might be interested in to hear about the open source
authoring tool we at Fidus Writer are working on. We are four people behind
Fidus Writer ( http://www.fiduswriter.com ) which is basically a Google
Docs for academics with citation management. We would like to enable
authors and editors to work with structured and complex content without
needing to know about technical details. If anything works as planed we
could have an open source 1.0 version this summer, which should be usable
for creating scientific papers and journals.

At the moment we try to gather as much feedback as possible and get in
contact with people that might be interested in this. So if you have any
questions or ideas don?t hesitate to drop us a line.



//Daniel

Join us in Montpellier for a one-day event to hack on scholarly PDFs!

Do you have tools that may help us to extract information from PDFs?
send us an email so that we can include them in the hackathon.

Would you like to extract citations from existing PDFs?

Wouldn't it be cool if we, scholars, did not have to pay for citation
data? What about author disambiguation?

Are you interested in identifying and extracting meaningful parts from PDFs?

Would you like to have XML/RDF for scholarly PDFs? What if you could
have access to the actual content of the PDF for supporting the Web of
Data?

We are interested in all of these issues, send us your tools, ideas,
comments and join us in Montpellier. We are also supporting remote
participation to the hackathon -hangout and webex.

The theme is: ?Access to the best knowledge is the key to delivering
quality healthcare?

Topic 4 may be of particular interest to these lists:  *Revolutionise the
scholarly publishing process*

The classical scholarly publishing model has not changed radically since
the nineteenth century. A key criticism is the requirement to reduce years
worth of research into a restrictive, text-based end product; the article
of record.

* How could we capture more of the research process and enable
collaboration before and after publication?

* In the future, scientific output could be measured using all types of
data, from spreadsheets of observations to algorithms and analysis tools.
How can we bring all of this information together to create a meaningful
product? What should an article look like to achieve maximum effectiveness?

* Leading the clinical open data challenge is the BMJ which requires all
research papers, especially those involving clinical trials, to deposit the
underlying clinical and research data in an open repository, but it is
often not usable by those most interested in it. What are the giant steps
forward that could enable the reuse of that data? For example, the Reinhart
and Rogoff economists' spreadsheet that was found wanting when a student
got access to their actual data.

* Storage of data needs to come with easy (open) tools that can enable
multiple fact checks.

* The peer-to-peer networking and public-key cryptography of Bitcoin is an
example of a zero barrier route to validating data.


But there are also bits on crowd-sourcing that may be of interest. Take a
look!

If you mean PubCrawler it's a per-publisher template/heuristic. Because
publishers use the same template over many journals it's worthwhile to work
out templates. I don't think you could use machine-learning very easily.
Some publishers are very difficult as they have javascript popups etc. many
publisher site are full of advertising junk and it's hard for a human to
find the table of contents.

Likely true for many other scientific disciplines.

 Original article: Troubling Trends in Scientific Software Use
 Science 17 May 2013: 883
 http://www.sciencemag.org/content/340/6134/814

http://phys.org/news/2013-05-ecologists-overreliance-unvetted-source-code.html

"(Phys.org) ?A team of scientists, led by ecologist Lucas Joppa of
Microsoft Research, has published a commentary piece in the journal
Science, highlighting what they say is a growing problem in research
efforts. They suggest that an overreliance on source code that has not
been properly vetted is increasingly leading to incorrect research
effort results.

The problem, Joppa et al, say, is that increasingly, researchers are
relying on existing software to perform their research, despite the
fact that no one has peer reviewed the software itself. It's a
problem, they say, that is particularly troubling when big
applications are used because small coding errors can be compounded. A
rounding error in a spreadsheet generally won't cause much problem,
they note, but when a rounding error is repeated over and over again,
perhaps millions of times, it can lead to completely inaccurate
results."

Dear all,

As you may remember, a workshop on Citizen Cyberscience at the University
of Geneva was advertised on this list. It took place end of April, and was
a very nice event.

I got the chance to attend and published a guest post at PLoS Blogs
'Citizen Sci' trying to sum up some of the main topics:

Thanks much to our hosts -- and a warm "hello" to Daniel who really does an
awesome job with Crowdcrafting :)

Hi All

Just a reminder that the call for proposals for sessions at OKCon ends
tomorrow
http://okcon.org/call-for-proposals/

It would be excellent to see open science represented so if you have
suggestions for sessions do put something forward! Feel free to use the
list to pose that last minute idea or find collaborators after entering a
proposal.

Best wishes

Jenny

Dear Rayna,

Thanks a lot for writing about the event, and more importantly, to read
that you liked it ;-)

Last weekend we organized another citizen science hackfest, but this time
in Madrid, Spain. The event was very successful too with lots of
participants. The funniest hack was working on creating spectrometers using
paper, cardboard, DVD-R and lots, and I mean it, lots of duct tape :D

Here you have a nice blog post about the event, with photos and a video
(only in Spanish) from the first day.

http://www.citizencyberscience.net/2013/05/ciencia-ciudadana-in-madrid/

All the best,

Daniel

Hello,

Me and a colleague are thinking about a workshop about "How to
establish Open Science as a Practice in scientific and
non-academic Communities" where everyone can present ideas on this
topic, a very pragmatic approach on open science. We for example began
to write an open science manifesto, which we would show at the workshop.

But I'm also very interested in some international collaboration in
sort of an open science hackathon. Anyone interested in starting some
projects (web, software, something else) or already does someone have
some ideas to hack around for a day? Like opening publications, making
open science visible, write extensions for software,...

cheers, stefan

Hey all,

I am thinking of submitting at least one proposal :) One would be something
about ways to bootstrap an open/citizen science community, to nurture it
etc. The focus would be on mapping DOs and DONTs, engaging professional
scientists, etc.

Another would be on open data in science, something that is unfortunately
often overlooked. The focus would be on more institutional involvement: how
do we reach out to funding agencies to push them to adopt such policies?

Will share the pad laterz, have somewhat urgent stuff to finish right now :)

Let me know what you think and whether you'd be interested!

Rayna

Hi Stefan

+1 for a workshop/hack day, we have run these successfully at previous
OKCons.
Would anybody who is planning to attend OKCon be willing to help organise
one if it got approved as a satellite event? Unfortunately, I'm not going
to be able to attend this year due to research commitments :(

They've been a lot of fun to organise and attend in the past!

Yep, I can help with this. My guess is that we can focus on nice tools such
as Crowdcrafting, Epicollect and FigShare.

Out of curiosity, I wonder how much interest there would be in a project
which is an open source version of IBM's Watson DeepQA system.  The
project, one of, I imagine, many, is started.

Subject: [open-science] Easy steps towards open scholarship
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEx8id0q_-0r6COr3QAgULO-=KiqRm+rWtva90LWTiv6jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

I got invited to write a blog post on simple, practical steps towards open
scholarship:
http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2013/05/24/easy-steps-towards-open-scholarship/

It isn't my usual style, it's a softer approach - I don't once mention
licencing issues (even though I know this is key if we want truly *open*
research). But hopefully it'll reach a different kind of audience hitherto
less impressed by the benefits of openness.

...with a combination of preprint & postprint postings, it's easy to make
your research freely available
Upload your work today!

Subject: [open-science] patent rights on the NCoV virus
Message-ID: <CAOayPeksdgUvtmVvqHih-VULeO3KU39=gOzAO-Kxho-1zv1bow@mail.gmail.com>

This is utterly horrid. Open knowledge sharing in this area particularly is
*vital* to saving lives and effectively diagnosing illnesses. Yet patents
appear to be impeding this.

WHO urges information sharing over novel coronavirus
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22649922

The move comes after Saudi Arabia said the development of diagnostic tests
had been delayed by patent rights on the NCoV virus by commercial
laboratories.

Twenty-two deaths and 44 cases have been reported worldwide since 2012, the
WHO says...

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

hello,

I would like to organize with others together an own satelite
event around the OKCon, an Open Science Hackathon. Best date for me
would be the 19th Sept.

Am sharing my thoughts and ideas around this and hope to get some
feedback.

The idea is to bring the international open science and citizen
science cummunity together - from different projects, disciplines and
interests - to work in a co:lab athmosphere/place together.
would be nice to have some pre-existing projects on board, here some
ideas:
- - open science manifesto
- - open science wordpress theme
- - citizen science, especially with the CERN/University of Geneva group
- - OpenMeteoData
- - Open Science Calendar
- - Open Clinical trials
- - Crowdcrafting
- - versioning of sourcecode and data (Git+GitHub, FigShare)
- - Open Science Workshop

it should not be only about coding, also talking about practices and
work on papers/positions or other stuff. at the end, it's all about what
the people want to do.

@ Rayna: are you interested in this? would be very nice to have you on
board.

So, what do you think? Am excited about your thoughts and ideas.

cheers, stefan

Totally :) Let's do that!

Any idea whether OKFN would be able to help us with the logistics?

Hi Rayna and Stefan,

Great to see this initiative. My name is Joris Pekel and I coordinate the
different Working Groups at the Open Knowledge Foundation. I think I might
be able to help you out with some of the logistics. Is it just about
getting a room? Or a bit more?

Let me know (perhaps better in a private message).

Cheers,

Joris

+1 from Citizen Cyberscience Centre for this!

We would be glad to help out and coordinate with other events.

In particular, this can connect with a second installment of the CERN webfest, which we organized last year with CERN summer students (see write-up here ) and which we intend to run again in August http://cds.cern.ch/record/1473657

Also with a recent workshop/hackfest we ran at UNIGE, which Rayna wrote up here: http://blogs.plos.org/citizensci/2013/05/23/university-of-geneva-hosts-citizen-cyberscience/ and which created quite some follow-up interest at UNIGE for specific projects biomedical and renewable energy research.

There's also some summer students at CERN who will be working on projects about open data and citizen science, and whose work could be great to develop further at the hackfest. And also relevant work ongoing with our UN partners in Geneva, UNOSAT, on disaster response using Crowdcrafting.org.

BTW, John Ellis, the top theoretical physicist at CERN, just accepted to give a keynote talk in the Open Science session. That's something else OKF can link to, to create a buzz.

Happy to help in any focussed planning team that you guys may decide to set up.

Francois

hello,

I would like to organize with others together an own satelite
event around the OKCon, an Open Science Hackathon. Best date for me
would be the 19th Sept.

Am sharing my thoughts and ideas around this and hope to get some
feedback.

The idea is to bring the international open science and citizen
science cummunity together - from different projects, disciplines and
interests - to work in a co:lab athmosphere/place together.
would be nice to have some pre-existing projects on board, here some
ideas:
- - open science manifesto
- - open science wordpress theme
- - citizen science, especially with the CERN/University of Geneva group
- - OpenMeteoData
- - Open Science Calendar
- - Open Clinical trials
- - Crowdcrafting
- - versioning of sourcecode and data (Git+GitHub, FigShare)
- - Open Science Workshop

it should not be only about coding, also talking about practices and
work on papers/positions or other stuff. at the end, it's all about what
the people want to do.

@ Rayna: are you interested in this? would be very nice to have you on
board.

So, what do you think? Am excited about your thoughts and ideas.

cheers, stefan

Dear all

I'm also really interested in helping you to organize this open science
hackaton event.
I was thinking also about a workshop with
hackyourPhD.<http://hackyourphd.org/category/english/>to create an
open book with "some open science guidelines for the PhD".
But I'm interested in all the topics you proposed Stefan!
Lets organize soon a skype!

If you know of any students in the UK who might have a great idea on the
theme of open research, open educational resources or similar, JISC are
offering ?5k grants for student teams to develop technology to improve
student teaching and research.

Dear C?lya

That sounds great! After Vincent gave his talk on the HackYourPhD community
at Oxford Open Science recently, I'm very keen that we work more with your
community!
At a summer school in Barcelona last year, a few of us started work on a
simple 'Graduate Guide to Open Scholarship' and of course Sophie Kershaw
has some fantastic resources
from the Open Science Training Initiative http://opensciencetraining.com/

+1 for getting started on a grad/PhD handbook

Jenny

Want to know about the different types of research data repositories that
are out there, and what features they have?

re3data.org - a Registry of Research Data Repositories launched

It looks quite interesting if you're into data...

I'd also recommend this fairly new Jisc mailing this that I've cross-posted
this from if you haven't seen it before. It's completely dedicated to
discussion of research data publication (and issues around this):
DATA-PUBLICATION at jiscmail.ac.uk

Subject: re3data.org - Registry of Research Data Repositories launched
To: DATA-PUBLICATION at jiscmail.ac.uk


re3data.org - Registry of Research Data Repositories launched

An increasing number of universities and research organisations are
starting to build research data repositories to allow permanent access in a
trustworthy environment to data sets resulting from research at their
institutions. Due to varying disciplinary requirements, the landscape of
research data repositories is very heterogeneous. This makes it difficult
for researchers, funding bodies, publishers, and scholarly institutions to
select an appropriate repository for storage of research data or to search
for data.

The re3data.org registry allows the easy identification of appropriate
research data repositories, both for data producers and users. The registry
covers research data repositories from all academic disciplines.
Information icons display the principal attributes of a repository,
allowing users to identify the functionalities and qualities of a data
repository. These attributes can be used for multi-faceted searches, for
instance to find a repository for geoscience data using a Creative Commons
licence.

By April 2013, 338 research data repositories were indexed in re3data.org.
171 of these are described by a comprehensive vocabulary, which was
developed by involving the data repository community (http://doi.org/kv3).

The re3data.org search at can be found at: http://www.re3data.org
The information icons are explained at: http://www.re3data.org/faq

Repository operators can suggest their infrastructures to be listed
inre3data.org via a simple application form:
http://www.re3data.org/suggestThe re3data.org team reviews and then lists
the proposed repositories in the registry. A repository is indexed when the
minimum requirements are met, i.e. mode of access to the data and
repository, as well as the terms of use must be clearly explained on the
repository pages.

re3data.org is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Project
partners inre3data.org are the Library and Information Services (LIS) of
the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Berlin School of
Library and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universit?t zu Berlin and
the KIT Library at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
re3data.orgcooperates with the German Initiative for Network
Information (DINI). The
three partners with their expertise in information infrastructures
guarantee the sustainability of the registry in the future.

Thanks, Ross!

While I was surprised to see that another such venture has been launched,
given that databib.org already exists, it seems that re3data.org goes above
and beyond by including detailed information about IP rights, responsible
organizations, etc.

Actually, to add to the mix, we also have BioSharing that focuses on 
bio/env/medical domains and includes a registry of standards and links 
the two: http://biosharing.org/
The rationale and target users for these catalogs are slightly different.

Subject: [open-science] OKCon13 Open/Citizen Science Satellite event:
 Summary of our first call & Doodle
Message-ID: <CANACerFCDZ9S9WzR=S0Po8WnPYrAxm=+7jWztzEqNX8PqrVLng@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Please find below the short summary of the questions we discussed today.
Thanks everyone who attended and provided insights!

Our second call will take place in around two weeks from now, if you wanna
join, please select a date: http://doodle.com/ghaagbppet256gst

Thanks,
Rayna

*---- Notes 29/05/2012 ----*
*Joris's feedback on 2012 event*
* this year's event is different from OKFest
* tickets are more expensive than OKFest 2012, so audience will be different
* feedback from OKFest2012 Science event:
http://science.okfn.org/2012/09/19/okfest-open-science-and-culture-hackday-project-2-louhos/
The hack event with a clear plan from the start was most productive
Last year, few devs/techies but otherwise very productive

*Details on this year's event*
* OpenGLAM has a satellite event on Monday, they've booked a room for 30
ppl -> get in touch with Beatrice (the main organizer)
* Main OKCon venue is an official conference venue, pretty strict rules.
Perhaps consider another opportunity.

*Discussions on the satellite event:*
Problems/opportunities for one-day event:
Experience from culture hacks: Joris: leave people on their own => not much
happens
* mixed audience in the same room -> possibly a fail
* contribute small actions on existing projects works fine
* take into account the competences of the different people
* plan things for non-techies (the projects should implement this too)
* pay attention to pre-defined teams and topics, can be a bit restrictive
* work interdisciplinary by finding a right balance between competences
given aims of the activity
* ask the different idea/topic-propellers to define the basic competences
they'll need to get their stuff running good idea!
Naming "hack day" implies coding, maybe consider other name?
communicate that deliverables are good to the projects. Deliverables can be:
- presentation 5min at end of day? << yes
- write short summary to a blog post for OKFN? << yes!
- share mind-map or other things produced during the day? << why not, but
this is a very specific thing and generally leaves everyone puzzled cuz it
reflects one's vision and links ;)

Submit proposal for satelite event before Friday 31st:
http://okcon.org/call-for-proposals/

idea: set limit on number of topics/pitches/projects to work on
e.g. if we can accommodate 30 participants, let's set a limit to 6-8 topics

*Next call:* in two weeks from now (around 10-14 June), we send a Doodle.

Subject: [open-science] follow-up our EU study on Science 2.0
Message-ID: <49BD2A25-E8AC-4D01-9C2B-8F67819BE805@gmail.com>

Hi
some time ago we reached out to this list in order to gather the evidence for our study for the EC. 
You contributed with great examples, although the award for the best evidence in support of Open Science certainly goes to Reinhart and Rogoff :)
As I reported back, the study has had quite an impact in the EC but we couldn't share it - precisely because it was policy relevant. 
Here I can share with you an example of the impact: the recent publication of the "Digital Science" strategy paper places Science 2.0 and Open Science at the heart of the strategy (with many references to our collective work).
http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/news/digital-science-horizon-2020

Many thanks to you all

I hope we can discuss all this with Cameron Neylon on the EU webinar next friday: see you there!

Subject: [open-science] re3data.org - Registry of Research Data Repositories
	launched

re3data.org - Registry of Research Data Repositories launched

An increasing number of universities and research organisations are starting to build research data repositories to allow permanent access in a trustworthy environment to data sets resulting from research at their institutions. Due to varying disciplinary requirements, the landscape of research data repositories is very heterogeneous. This makes it difficult for researchers, funding bodies, publishers, and scholarly institutions to select an appropriate repository for storage of research data or to search for data.

The re3data.org registry allows the easy identification of appropriate research data repositories, both for data producers and users. The registry covers research data repositories from all academic disciplines. Information icons display the principal attributes of a repository, allowing users to identify the functionalities and qualities of a data repository. These attributes can be used for multi-faceted searches, for instance to find a repository for geoscience data using a Creative Commons licence.

By April 2013, 338 research data repositories were indexed in re3data.org. 171 of these are described by a comprehensive vocabulary, which was developed by involving the data repository community (http://doi.org/kv3).

The re3data.org search at can be found at: http://www.re3data.org
The information icons are explained at: http://www.re3data.org/faq

Repository operators can suggest their infrastructures to be listed inre3data.org via a simple application form: http://www.re3data.org/suggest The re3data.org team reviews and then lists the proposed repositories in the registry. A repository is indexed when the minimum requirements are met, i.e. mode of access to the data and repository, as well as the terms of use must be clearly explained on the repository pages.

re3data.org is funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG). Project partners in re3data.org are the Library and Information Services (LIS) of the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, the Berlin School of Library and Information Science at the Humboldt-Universit?t zu Berlin and the KIT Library at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). re3data.org cooperates with the German Initiative for Network Information (DINI). The three partners with their expertise in information infrastructures guarantee the sustainability of the registry in the future.

Detailed information can be found in the following PeerJ preprint: http://doi.org/mnn
