Subject: [open-science] Minutes from WG Meeting May 11 2011
Message-ID: <BANLkTimnnkmZtDt9zBho6oz2qWTHmYMPZg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

See below for a delayed summary of key points from the WG meeting on May 11
2011, followed by a list of interesting events that are coming up and some
recent articles or publications featuring working group members. It you spot
articles that could be included in the next round up, please add them to the
next meeting Etherpad! http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-15Jun2011

If you?d like more detailed updates on projects or to view the full minutes,
visit the meeting Etherpad at http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-11May2011.
The next meeting will be Wednesday 15th June, 17:30 GMT. You can sign up and
add agenda items here http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-15Jun2011.
*
UPDATES:*

1) Panton Principle Publicity:

Graham Steel has been liaising with BioMedCentral with regard to a web
banner for the Panton Principles. Following a vote on a range of taglines, a
unanimous verdict was returned in favour of "Open data means better
science". However, a special commendation to Puneet for /because you don't
want to be caught with your pantoff/. Maybe next time...

To illustrate what the Panton Principles would like to achieve it would be
great to have some case studies on the website. Several ideas have been
suggested at previous meetings, but please add your ideas to the relevant
section of the next agenda http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-15Jun2011 and we
will have a collaborative drafting session on Monday 20th June, ~1730 UTC
(more details to follow)

Translations: Please see the current list at
http://pantonprinciples.org/translations/ - if you could add a translation
or think you know someone who could then please do get in touch!

2) SWAT4LS Workshop:

The working group will be organising a hackathon in conjunction with the
SWAT4LS conference in late Nov/early Dec
The focus will be mapping open malaria research, and an earlier session will
be planned to set the foundations for participants to build on, so watch
this space!

If anyone knows of an organisation that might sponsor an event such as this,
please drop me an email!

*3) Draft of step by step guide to data licensing for 'Managing and Sharing
Data - best practice for researchers' guide

The UK Data Archive has just published the 3rd edition of its 'Managing and
Sharing Data - best practice for researchers' guide.
It is available online at: *
http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/media/2894/managingsharing.pdf*<http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/media/2894/managingsharing.pdf>

We have been given the opportunity to contribute to the next edition and
give open data a more prominent place within the guide. If you would be keen
to contribute to this then please email me. All drafts will be put to the
working group for comment.

4) EC Commission Communication on scientific information in the digital age
(30 May)
http://science.okfn.org/2011/05/11/european-commission-hearing-on-scientific-information-bringing-open-scientific-data-onto-the-european-agenda/

Both Cameron Neylon and Diane Cabell attended this hearing.

5) Royal Society Open Science Call for Evidence

In addition to a townhall meeting in London, a formal call has been issued
for evidence for the Royal Society policy study Science as a public
enterprise: opening up scientific
information<http://royalsociety.org/policy/sape>
.

More details on how to contribute are at the link above or here:

Hi All

Claudia requests below that we add a launch date to the Panton Principles to
make them more citeable.
The launch date was 19 Feb 2010 but you currently have to click through to
the OKFN blog from http://pantonprinciples.org/about/ to find that out.

If no one objects, I can add the date at the bottom of the main Principles
page. Let me know if you think there is a better way of doing this!

Hi All

See below for a conversation Maria and I have been having regarding
publicity for the Panton Principles (PP from here on in!). It started when I
shared a poster design:
http://tinyurl.com/6gj2e6v

Since, some very interesting points have come up. As a quick summary for
those who don't want to read the whole conversation:

- Would a PP logo be a good thing to have? Should we have a design
contest/request ideas and submission?
- Peter came up with a tagline for a web banner of 'Open data means better
science', could a question directly addressing the community be more
engaging for the poster?
- Would a design like this
http://sunnibrown.com/2010/06/03/pbs-this-emotional-life/ be too childish?
- What makes open data in science unique compared to open data in other
fields and how could we incorporate this into our messages/publicity?
*
*Any comments, opinions, design ideas etc are most welcome!

Thanks for the comments, all very good points!

Hi Jenny,

Sorry for being late with my reply.
I took a look at the poster and I really like it.
Trying to be critical, I might have some suggestions:

- in terms of the elements included, I was wondering if it would be a good
idea to include the ofkn logo, together with a possible logo for the Panton
principles themselves?


We currently don't have a PP logo and with just the OKF logo it looks a
little unbalanced, but I have been trying to come up with a PP logo for
quite a while now, and getting nowhere. I think it needs to be a
collaborative effort (preferably involving more creative people than me!).
Do you have any ideas as to what make a good logo? I was trying to do
something simple with two Ps but had exactly the same problem you describe
below in that it had no relation to open data in science.

*Maybe we can launch a logo design contest? Or choose something from the
T-shirt competition for Open Data (
http://blog.okfn.org/2011/06/07/okf-t-shirt-competition/) - like a special
prize for something that would potentially be turned into a PP logo?*



- The website is with red, while the poster is with green, maybe a
consistency in tems of colours/style/font will make it memorable?


I agree, we definitely need a consistent theme, but I found red, white and
black a little restrictive when it came to poster design. Originally I was
looking at going for this sort of style:
http://sunnibrown.com/2010/06/03/pbs-this-emotional-life/
What do you think of that? The elements of the current poster could probably
be retained along with your suggestions below and it would be more
consistent with the website (although the website can easily be changed

*This style is lovely, I would fall for it immediately! The only challenge
would be to keep it not too childish.. (it would work perfect I guess for
advocating PP for the general public. I wonder if 'scientists' would
resonate - and now I'm playing Devil's advocate.*
*How about this style, just black on white, and with a coloured logo. And
with some science elements (like equations, a dna structure....)*

I'm glad you like it! I think we could keep it out of the childish region
relatively easily. I like the idea of incorporating science elements and I
think we should keep it simple, but some colour would help draw attention
probably. We could play with that later. Maybe we could sketch some quick
ideas exchange them via scanning and emailing? I have some time next weekend
to try and be a bit creative!


- the poster presents the three main principles/steps. Maybe the original
idea is to simply create awareness and to keep the message as simple as
possible... but if there is space for some more content, I would put an
intriguiting question/a message for making the principles highly
relevant/desirable/ or simply to help the viewer understand the message without
needing him to go to the website in order to figure it out,(now I'm
reffering to a general public, but maybe I am wrong and your target are the
scientific communities who.... are/aren't familiar with the idea?)


The idea was very much to get the name out there and try to encourage people
to log on to the website, and we were targetting scientists (the idea was
that this could go up on department noticeboards) but a question or tagline
would be good. We came up for one for a web banner 'Open data means better
science' - if we can think of an intriguing question that might be even
better!

*If we address communities directly, maybe: "Want better science? Open your
data. (find out how)" Just an idea..*



- the benefit of a more explicit message (or possibly rethinking the images)
can also be argued like this: If the poster remains the same and we change
the title- instead of 'Panton Principles' with 'Creative Ideas', 'New Media
Content', 'Open Design' or simply any kind of 'Resources' - then the poster
would still make sense, as the circle images are general/stereotypical and
the three principles are appliable to any kind of 'Openness' movement.
(ok, :) not all the images, except the left one with the dna code, but
still, this also can represent just 'knowledge'). Maybe it would be better
to find something that is specificly oriented towards science and what does
it mean to open data from the scientific domain towards the public one?


It would be better, I just couldn't do it! Any ideas you have would be very
welcome, we can also throw this discussion open to the mailing list if you
don't mind your comments being forwarded?

*Please be free to forward any of my messages. Just some thoughts on the
particularities of open data in science: for me, it means a change of
thinking- science is as competitive as business or any other domain. As the
social constructivism of science claims, there si no objective truth there
to be discovered. It is everything an intertwined web of social, economical,
political and technological developments, and elements like:  phd funding,
peer-reviews, universities agenda, sponsors of innovation organisations, the
rush to be published and recognised by the scientific community- the
prestige of being quoted, the rush to be the first one coming up with a new
discovery, the avidity of being validated by older peers, or, on the
contrary, to disqualify the big theoreticians ..... they are all part of
this web and its results. Things can be different in a zillion ways, when it
comes to innovation.*
*
*
*As I experience it in the academic world (and I am just at my master level)
is this fierce competition between people can be quite dramatic. Bruno
Latour writes excellent about this inner mechanisms (if you are curiouse,
take a look here:
http://www.bruno-latour.fr/livres/MTP-TABLE%20OF%20CONTENTS.html Making
things Public, Re-assembling the Social)*
*
*
*Panton Principles hit a very sensitive point in the scientific community. *
*Let's put it in the 'worst scenario' case: the mission is to convince a
community of individuals sensitive about recognition and solitary results,
to collaborate, share, and do it together.*
*And it has to pay off something more valuable than it pays now. *
*Mobility, Recognition and prestige are always good motivators and I guess
there is no other way. Can we think of a system of recognition within Panton
Principles?
*
*To attach to the Panton Principles the idea of a great reputation.*
*
*
*Thought: Bruno Latour would be a great key opinion leader in the community.
*
*Maybe we can develop a Panton  Principles Manifesto? And 'attack' the
scientific community from two sides: bottom-up (hackers, hacktivists and the
rest of the cool guys) and from above (key opinion leaders - people that
have high chances to publish real fast something about the manifesto).*

I think the Principles themselves are the manifesto, but getting opinion
leaders to endorse and publicise them would be great. We should also look at
the website and how it records endorsements, it might be nice to get a
counter on there now there are already quite a few.


- what is unique about open data in science, in comparison with other sets
of open data/open data in general?


I suppose that as opposed to e.g. government data it has always been
explicitly intended for reuse and redistribution, because that's how science
works. However, it is difficult to reuse because access is often controlled
by journals as opposed to the data generators/providers (the scientists) -
in other domains there is no middle party, and there is currently little
reward/recognition for scientists publishing data openly. Also, just the
fact that so much can be done with it! Genuinely new results can be
generated (rather than standard analyses or interesting visualisations)
alongside the advatange of improving quality and being better able to spot
mistakes/discrepancies which is common to most fields of open data. Those
were the first things that came to mind, but this is probably one to open to
the mailing list because there are people there who have thought about this
a lot more than me. Also, I'm not sure my points help in terms of poster
design but somebody else's might.



- may I ask who is the target/where will it be published?


The target initially were scientists who don't already know much about the
open data movement, the idea was that it could be sent to University science
departments to be put up on noticeboards, although obviously if we get a
design that is good for the public as well then all the better!

*Great! Besides universities and research centres, maybe it would be also
fruitful here: http://www.4sonline.org/ It would be a great dissemination
platform (online and at the conference itself). Maybe someone from the Open
Knowledge Foundation can have a short presentation there about ....And other
portals and conferences as well...*
*Maybe I can help with some online research on this and provide you with a
list of contacts? *

That sounds great! If you identify events/conferences etc where this could
be discussed it is always worth dropping an email to the mailing list as
someone may already be planning to go, or may not have heard of it but would
like to. A list of contacts would be an excellent start, and we can try to
encourage as many people as possible to visit the website and endorse the
Principles.

Let me know if you're happy for us to move this discussion to the mailing
list as I think some really interesting points could come out of it! Speak
to you soon

*Great, of course! Keep in touch!*

Jenny



Thank you!

Keep in touch,

The poster looks slick!   But I worry that use of the term 'sharing' is not helping to reach out to the unconverted within the scientific community.  Scientists are more likely to recognize common cause with the PP when the issue is framed in terms of bolstering the scientific method, not when when it calls for behavior (altruistic sharing) that run counter to how 'competitive-collaborative' science is conducted.  Most scientists think of 'sharing' data with collaborators only if and when they can advance their own research.   We don't ask scientists to 'share' their manuscripts (an altruistic act), but rather to publish their manuscripts (a professional obligation but one that brings rewards).  So 'Replicate' -> 'Reuse' -> 'Revolutionize' might be closer to a message that would resonate outside of the choir, and convey the sense that 'open data means better science'.  'Replicate' might not be the perfect term either, though it does at least have the virtue of starting with an 'R'!

Agreed on coolness of poster, and also the benefits of a word other than
"share."

"Release" is another candidate.  "Data release" works well as a parallel to
"code release."

I'd be inclined to actually go with Publish...presses all the right traditional buttons and the principles themselves are very specific in focussing on "published data from public science" so if it is part of the push to "publish your data" then I think that works. PP was less about publishing more data and more about publishing more effectively.

Cheers

Cameron

I like this. The second "principles" could be omitted

I am open-minded on this. It should be the ONLY one - we will have enough
detractors without being labelled at the muesli-knitting brigade. So If it's
one of (say) 5 then it may well attract some people, but it will antagonize
others.

I DO like Professor Weasel http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yVdyprbjJo
and maybe this could be extended to Open Data.

Agreed. "Sharing" will upset some people. "Record" is less likely to be

Hi everyone,

I stumbled upon a Call for Proposals from ESOF 2012 (Euroscience Open Forum), starring Dublin as the European Capital of Science for 11-15 July 2012-?http://www.dublinscience2012.ie/

There are two openings for projects, both having the deadline on the 30 of June:

1. The Scientific Session Proposals?- mainly as workshops/presentations/roundtable/conference/Pecha Kucha
2. The Public Engagement Proposal ?- ?mainly as an activity, creative idea,?theatre, film,?Interactive Dialogue,?Exhibition,??Workshop,??Outdoor Event,??Debate and so on.


Do you think our working group can develop one (or more) project proposals on Open Data in Science/Panton Principles? I would be a great opportunity to attend ESOF next year and?I would like to invite you for an online brainstorm in the next days. Hopefully, in the best case scenario, by the end of the week we can choose the best ideas, refine them and prepare the proposal for the 30 of June.

What do you think? Let's plan something!

Best,
Maria

PS: You can find below some extra info from the official press release:


"Dublin City of Science 2012 comprises a year-long series of science-linked events,?

the centre-piece of which will be the Euroscience Open Form (ESOF), which will be?
held in the Convention Centre Dublin from 11-15 July 2012.
ESOF is an interdisciplinary, pan-European meeting, held under the auspices of?
Euroscience, which aims to:?
Showcase the latest advances in science and technology.
Promote a dialogue on the role of science and technology in society and?
public policy.
Stimulate and provoke public interest, excitement and debate about science?
and technology.
The event will bring together over 5,000 scientists, business leaders, government?
officials and international media to discuss the best of European science and to?
address all of the major global challenges, including Energy, Climate Change, Food?
and Health.
Dublin was awarded the honour of hosting this event following an open competition in?
2008. The Dublin bid was led by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government, Prof?
Cunningham, with the support of Forf?s and beat off stiff competition from Vienna.?
Prof Cunningham and Forf?s are now responsible for planning and organisation of?
ESOF. In addition, they will coordinate other activities and events in the Dublin City of?
Science 2012 programme."

I'm definitely in favour, I've attended the last two ESOFs and thought they
were really good. They attract a cross-disciplinary crowd with
representatives from sci comm/publishing/policy/industry etc as well as
researchers. There's usually a lot of early career scientists in particular
because they give a big discount to people under 35. Peter Murray Rust spoke
in 2008 in Barcelona on the topic of open data in science (abstract from
session posted at the end of this email, although it is ridiculously broad!)

Perhaps we could take a look at some exciting things that are being
done/could be done with open data (rather than a general 'why is open good'
discussion), and then examine why it isn't all happening yet. Maybe we could
make this a discussion with the audience as to why they might/might not
consider publishing their data openly? Entirely different suggestions and
further thoughts welcome!

How about "Report"?
That is already used in the context of scientific reports, reporting data
etc

There was also an excellent satellite event in 2008 organised by
Science Commons:

http://blog.okfn.org/2008/07/24/moving-forward-with-open-science-in-europe/

I wonder whether we might also consider organising a similar satellite
event with them for the next one? ;-)

Right now we're not planning anything formal for ESOF 2012 (remember 
that SC doesn't exist any more, it's all just CC...) but I'm committed 
to a few panel proposals so far and hopefully one will get through and 
onto the program. Happy to have an informal meet up or join in something 
that gets organized...

It's a good idea. I would likely not add any extra day to my trip if I 
were to go (I have a new remix - my 3 month old son - and am traveling a 
*lot* less!) but CC would have some people in Europe that could participate.

Subject: [open-science] Open Knowledge London!
Message-ID: <BANLkTin1oOFm_kz9St=BO7DujktQj9BhWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

We're very pleased to announce that we're going to be starting a
series of regular meetups for people interested in open data, open
content, and all things open in London. The Centre for Creative
Collaboration has partnered with the Open Knowledge Foundation to let
us use their fantastic space!

More information about the kind of thing we'll be up to is at:

http://jwyg.okfn.org/2011/06/10/proposal-open-knowledge-london/

For anyone interested in participating, please join the
ok-london-announce list (which I think we should rename to just
ok-london!):

http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ok-london-announce

Please help us to spread the word! The first meeting will probably be
in mid-July.

All the best,

Jonathan

I don't know if I'll be at the conference, but I'd be glad to meet up with
everyone for happy hour.

Message-ID: <BANLkTinfG51NBA6kraWHSNjpOTtJ3QNTRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there!

I'm Yan, one of the founders of the open science student group at MIT. I've
been following this mailing list for a while now and thought it might be
useful for those of us in the Boston/Cambridge area to have a meetup, at
least so that those of us in the MIT group can get a better feel for what
people in the area are doing to support the goals of open science. We're
fairly new to the game and still trying to figure out what next semester
will look like in terms of our objectives, so it'd be helpful for us to make
connections to members of the okfn community.

Please let me know if you're interested in meeting for drinks or a quick
lunch, hopefully sometime within the next two weeks. Feel free to make
suggestions for a location.

A couple more words about the MIT Society for Open Science: We were started
this February and currently consist of about a dozen undergrad and grad
students. One of our main goals is to raise awareness for open science and
open knowledge among local college communities through organizing events
such as colloquium talks and conferences. We also have some interest in
creating software and web tools to facilitate scientific collaboration. To
date, our biggest achievement has been organizing a colloquium by the open
science advocate (and quantum computation researcher) Dr. Michael Nielsen
through the MIT Physics Department, scheduled for Sept. 22, 2011. You can
reach us through the mailing list open-science at mit.edu.

Cheers,
Yan

I'd be interested in a Boston/Cambridge meet-up.  Unfortunately, I'm only in
Cambridge about once a month these days and don't plan to be there in the
next two weeks.  But if you're building a list of people in the area, add my
name.

I think these smaller scale meetups (e.g. compare to OKCon) are indeed
important!

After meeting up with people working on an electronic labnotebook
system here at Karolinska, I finally picked up an my earlier intention
to start a regular meeting series, resulting in Stockholm Open Science
[0]. In fact, we'll meet up today for the first time, and meet monthly
after summer (in fact, this is a bit late, as for many here summer
starts today, though the weather disagrees [1] :). The main goal of
these lunch meeting would be to network, learn from each other, etc.

I was wondering if the Open Science wg should perhaps set up a list of
such local initiatives on a the OKFN website?

Greetings,

Egon

Very much agree. Most of the events we do are small, focused, informal
workshops aimed at Getting Things Done. ;-)

Great idea! We can also offer:

  (i) local mailing lists (lists.okfn.org)
  (ii) local groups (e.g. for people to have a profile,etc, e.g.
http://okfn.org/groups/open-knowledge-london/)
  (iii) local websites (e.g. science.okfn.org)

This said, I'd strongly argue for using the open-science list, group
and science.okfn.org for things that might be of interest to others!

(generally) should de directed to pages which relate to their country/city/

tractable things for them to start editing and contributiingt to.

So, for use that would be:

stkhmos at lists.okfn.org
http://okfn.org/groups/stockholm-open-science/ or
http://okfn.org/groups/stkhmos/
http://stkhmos.science.okfn.org/

?

Customized lists are good for organizing things, and e.g. Swedish
could be allowed on our group list, but also include practical things
whether there are pancakes today at the restaurant we're meeting...
that is, things not of general interest, but useful for the group.

General interest things can indeed be better on general lists, or via
e.g. twitter. Our has tag is (as you might have expected from the
above: #stkhmos :)

Yes - you're welcome to have all of these! :-)

The one thing I'd also suggest is that national lists are also good -
e.g. to pull people interested in different open content/data projects
into one bigger discussion. E.g. we have these in Austria, Bulgaria,
Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy and other counties. Also have
regional open knowledge lists in London, Berlin, etc - for people
interested in open knowledge in different domains. This fits with OKF
mission of strengthening broader open knowledge community.

Kat, Lucy and I are going to be putting further instructions on all
this kind of thing into a big document called the OKF Handbook soon -
which will let people know how they can use OKF facilities to do
useful stuff.

Agreed. :-)

Yes - as long as you promise not to have all the interesting
discussions on the Stockholm list! :-)

Dear all,

Received an email earlier today from the guys at BMC to confirm that the newly designed PP banner went live this morning.

Cue this "announcement" on FriendFeed after I found out.

Subject: [open-science] Membership List for Working Group
Message-ID: <BANLkTimZPEMsCec3eJmQoAGS6NtDEytgXQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Since science.okfn.org was established, the working group membership list
has been migrated across http://science.okfn.org/members/. Unfortunately, as
it is no longer a Wiki format people can't add themselves, so please see new
instructions for adding or updating your entry below!

Who is a member?
Anyone who wants to be! You don't have to add your name to participate in
the mailing list/meetings or other activities, but it is a nice resource for
other members and people coming across the group to see the spread of people
we have involved.

How do I get my name on the list?
Email your name, affiliation and any associated URLs (e.g. personal web
page, OKF profile) to which you would like your entry to link to
jenny.molloy at okfn.org.
If you don't already have one, you could also set up a profile on the OKF
main site and join the informal Science group
http://okfn.org/groups/science/

What can I do as a member?
As well as participating in the mailing list and monthly Skype meetings, to
which all are invited, you could also:
Offer to blog on science.okfn.org. This could be a guest post or if you'd
like to be a more regular contributor, we can set you up with an account.
Get included in the list of publications/articles/videos/podcasts by or
involving members that we are beginning to include in monthly updates.
Please flag up your own or other member's work for inclusion on the meeting
Etherpads (links sent out monthly)!

Thanks very much, and do let me know if you have any questions.

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] SWAT4LS Hackathon Update
Message-ID: <BANLkTinxLt9K=4Yc_JX056wGCOtqxcGvSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

The working group is organising a hackathon as part of the SWAT4LS
conference (http://www.swat4ls.org/) - see below for more details and a call
for volunteers!

When: Wednesday 7 December 2011, all day

Where: ULU, London (TBC)

What:
A one day open data in science hackathon with partcipants from the Semantic
Web for the Life Sciences community.
The theme is to be generating open research reports using bibliographic data
from PubMedCentral, focussing on malaria research. It is also designed to
demonstrate what can be done with open data and discussions/ideas generated
throughout the day will doubtless be wide ranging! Demos and discussions
will also take place at the SWAT4LS meeting proper the next day.

What we need:
Volunteers with hackathon experience to assist on the day, and also in
developing a framework for participants prior to the day itself, to ensure
it is as productive as possible.

If you're interested in assisting, let me know at jenny.molloy at okfn.org

Thanks very much!

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] Panton Principles Case Studies
Message-ID: <BANLkTimPdDC60QxwGPUiLHe3LimDEukepg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

For several working group meetings, we have briefly discussed the
possibility of writing some case studies for the Panton Principles,
higlighting people, projects or papers that have published according to the
prinicples and hopefully why that is a good idea.

A short paragraph and ideally a quote from the authors could be placed on
the Panton Principles web site and hopefully be useful for visitors to the
site and advocates of the Principles for use in discusssions or
presentations.

Our current suggestions are listed below and on this Etherpad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-PPcasestudies, but we need more!

- People who try to work according to PP or are inspirational advocates of
open scientific data.

- Notable papers which have been published according to PP (especially any
who have made a special effort to make data as open as possible)

- Longer term projects which are publishing data according to PP

- Any other interesting examples of open data in science

Deadline for suggestions is 11th July, when we will have a drafting session
on Etherpad and Skype - if you'd like to participate please add your Skype
ID here http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-PPcasestudies

NB: This session is postponed from the originally suggested date of 20th
June

Thanks very much!

Jenny
