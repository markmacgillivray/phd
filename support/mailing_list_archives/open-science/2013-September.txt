Subject: [open-science] consultation paper on legal issues of biodiversity
	paper
Message-ID: <01e501cea7a3$986f4560$c94dd020$@amnh.org>

Dear colleagues

 

Here is the link to our consultation paper on legal issues concerning a Biodiversity Knowledge Management System in Europe.

 

D2.4.1:  <http://wiki.pro-ibiosphere.eu/w/media/7/7f/Pro-iBiosphere_WP2_Plazi_D2.4.1_VFF_30082013.pdf> http://wiki.pro-ibiosphere.eu/w/media/7/7f/Pro-iBiosphere_WP2_Plazi_D2.4.1_VFF_30082013.pdf

 

It is intended for a consultation to get more opinions, both from a legal point of view as well as the coverage of the topic. A final version will be submitted in June 2014.

 

Please send any feedback which we appreciate highly to egloff_bader at bluewin.ch

 

Thanks for any feedback

 

Donat

This kind of thing has been happening for a while. It is a natural 
consequence of open licenses. Wikipedia has been re-packaged and sold 
many times 
<http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2010/04/06/wikipedia-pod-a-flooded-amazon-the-endless-spigot-at-alpha-and-betascript-publishing/>. 
While I can't find an example, popular open source software has fallen 
prey from time to time, being repackaged and sold to uninformed 
consumers who don't realize there are cost-free versions available.

I would argue this new world requires more of the consumer. Be savvy. Do 
a little google research. There's no going back to simpler times, the 
complexity is here to stay.

I cannot see the NSA context of CC-BY, sorry.

There was no copyright in the middle ages and a lot of fruitful plagiarism.
May I remember to my thoughts at

http://jlsc-pub.org/jlsc/vol1/iss1/5/

CC-BY-ND blocks translations and other derivative works.

CC-BY-NC blocks scholarly use in commercial context e.g. use in the most
(commercial) e-journals.

I have had in-depth discussions with both Heather Morrison and Rosie
Redfield. I think they misinterpret what CC-BY allows and what CC-NC
prevents. In science, at least, we have used CC-BY for 10 years with no
problems. The only real effect , in science, for CC-NC - is that it allows
the publisher (not the author) to make additional money from reselling
rights to the article. Thus a CC-NC for an Elsevier article does not forbid
commercial re-use- it simply means that re-users have to pay Elsevier an
additional and lucrative tax. CC-NC in science is about ibcreasing
publisher income, not about restricting re-use.

In A+H the current ethos is that authors sell their books.  CC-NC may have
a bearing on this, though it will depend on the exact details of copyright
and the publisher. In general CC-NC controls who can make money.

Thanks for bringing that up Ignasi. That is one of the well known reasons why NC is not advised if one intends the work to be really open. Inability to legally mix NC with SA is a big barrier. Which is why BY or BY-SA are the best licenses.

Normally, it's the copyright owner who controls the conditions of a CC license. And Elsevier doesn't require the transfer of copyright for OA articles. Thus, someone who sees an Elsevier article with a CC-NC license and wishes to reuse it commercially would normally ask the authorization to the author.

But Peter is right, because as part of the publication contract, authors grant Elsevier an exclusive license covering all publishing and distribution rights, which is quite the same in practice as transferring copyright. So, the author should refer any commercial reuse request to Elsevier.

The problem is that, as far as I can tell, these tricky conditions are not displayed in the articles nor clearly stated in Elsevier website, and I'm not sure if authors understand them well when they sign the publication agreement..

By the way, this also illustrates the danger of giving too much emphasis to the fact that the authors keep the copyright (for instance, it's a criterion in PLoS/SPARC openness scale). The relevant question is really the extent of the rights retained (or the permissions obtained) by the author.

Call me a noob, but how does this happen? Can you really grant 
"exclusive license covering all publishing and distribution rights" to a 
third party on something released under creative commons? It seems to me 
that there should be nothing prohibiting me from downloading all 
creative commons articles (from any journal) and re-distributing them on 
my own website (in a non-commercial way), right?

I guess I was interpreting this all similar to the open source world. I 
can download all the open source code in the world and host it on my own 
website as long as I adhere to the terms of the license. It seems like 
putting additional restrictions on top of a CC license violates the CC 
license itself.

It is possible that the contract signed by the author is not consistent
with CC-NC.The wording might "give" the publisher exclusive rights to some
things (although it may not). You would have to read the contract

You may. The problem is that the primary place that
re-use rights are offered is on the publisher's website through RightsLink.
This gives a wide range of options for re-use and the answer can be:
* yes, you can re-use
* please contact the publisher
*yes, but pay the publisher for the privilege

I have never had a message that routes me to the author.

I think Rightslink is a poor way of tackling the problem as it has
automatic algorithms and the primary purpose is to generate revenue for the
publisher, not the author.

Also I see no reason why the *author* could not offer anyone CC-BY rights
as long as they retained copyright and did not transfer rights to the
publisher.

Almost all OSI-compliant F/OSS licences are essentially equivalent to CC-BY
or CC-BY-SA (or possibly public domain) . The NC clause was abandoned many
years ago and (IMO) this was a great step forward.

Good question. I'd say that this license (between the author and the publisher) applies in practice only to the rights the author doesn't grant the users according to the CC-license chosen. So, the right to authorize commercial uses, if the -NC condition is used, and the right to make adaptations (derivative works), is the -ND condition is used.

But I agree that there could be a contradiction here, because the normal definition of an exclusive license is that no other license covering the same rights can be granted to another party. But I'm not able to go farther into the legal intricacies of such a case.

For a CC-BY license, however, all use rights are granted to all. There is thus no need for a license between the author and the publisher, as no permission need be asked to the right holder (or the licensee) for any use. As far as I can tell (I checked just a few) OA journals using CC-BY don't use author-publisher licenses.

I checked the terms of Elsevier exclusive license, and it seems there is in fact no such contradiction, because Elsevier is first granted all the rights (by way of the exclusive license with the author), and then is the one who applies the CC license (letting the author decide which version).

Normally, it's the copyright owner who applies a CC license to a work, but a licensee having been granted all the rights is the one who is intitled to do it (and the author has lost any control in this regard).

This again illustrates that copyright ownership may mean next to nothing when a publisher asks for an exclusive license, instead of copyright transfer.

Following the OKF and Jonathan Gray's open data stories initiative (http://bit.ly/opendata-betterdata), we're looking for stories on how open research data has made research/research data better. We're collecting stories/examples of how open data (CC0) can lead to better data and better research in this Google Doc (http://tiny.cc/4c2v2w).

Everyone knows about transparency, accountability, reusability, etc. Great concepts, but let's get some stories down that we can use to really inspire researchers to start sharing their data! If you know of more stories to add, please email amye.kenall at biomedcentral.com<mailto:amye.kenall at biomedcentral.com> or tweet @LouWoodley<https://twitter.com/search?q=%40LouWoodley&src=typd&mode=users> or @AmyeKenall<https://twitter.com/AmyeKenall>.

Please forward/share as much as possible!

Sent querie to a couple of copyright lawyers - Will respond when I get
their answers back. But yes, I think that in the end once one signs that
exclusive licence to Elsevier (something authors can do since they own the
copyright) then that is it. It is also  odd in the reuse table
<http://www.elsevier.com/about/publishing-guidelines/policies/open-access-policies/oa-license-policy>that
only one of those "no" has an asterisk saying "excpet for the author"
which implies authors have none of the other rights that have a green tick
(despite being the owners of the copyright). So seems that restrictions
that are designed for third parties apply to authors - which to me sounds
like pure nonsense.

Elsevier's exclusive license contract (called "author agreement") is explained in details here:

http://www.elsevier.com/about/open-access/open-access-policies/author-agreement

It's written in a language easier to understand than the legal jargon often seen in copyright agreements.

Some excerpts:

"[...] There are two agreements [...] an author agreement and a user license."

"In order for us to do our job of publishing and disseminating your research article we need publishing rights."

"Elsevier is granted [...] the right to publish and disseminate the article under the author's choice of user license"

Like Fabiana, I was also surprised to see in Elsevier's explanations that "restrictions that are designed for third parties apply to authors".

Unfortunately, I couldn't find on Elsevier website the actual text of the license, but if it is correctly described in the web page, there seems to be an incoherence between these two statements:

(1) Elsevier is granted the rights to publish and distribute the article;

and

(2) Authors choosing the -ND restriction will have the same reuse rights as simple users, with only "additional scholarly rights to create certain derivative works".

As I understand it, (1) means that only the rights mentioned are granted, so the authors keep the full rights to make adaptations / derivatives (including for commercial purposes), and thus are not bound by the -ND and -SA restrictions (which apply to the users, not the rights holder), or by the limitations in the types of derivative works mentioned in (2), again because the corresponding rights have not been granted to Elsevier.

Unfortunately, it seems that even here lawyers are needed to sort things out :-(

Good question. I'd say that this license (between the author and the publisher) applies in practice only to the rights the author doesn't grant the users according to the CC-license chosen. So, the right to authorize commercial uses, if the -NC condition is used, and the right to make adaptations (derivative works), is the -ND condition is used.

But I agree that there could be a contradiction here, because the normal definition of an exclusive license is that no other license covering the same rights can be granted to another party. But I'm not able to go farther into the legal intricacies of such a case.

For a CC-BY license, however, all use rights are granted to all. There is thus no need for a license between the author and the publisher, as no permission need be asked to the right holder (or the licensee) for any use. As far as I can tell (I checked just a few) OA journals using CC-BY don't use author-publisher licenses.

Wow, that is interesting. I am curious how I, as the author holding 
copyright over my article, could be bound by an outside agreement. I 
guess it might be like a non-disclosure agreement. I could write 
something down, which I reasonably hold copyright on and still be bound 
by a separate agreement stating I *can't* do certain things with my 
writing. Right? Am I interpreting this situation correctly?

Clearly, the choice of open access license is extremely important. 
Knowing what I know now, I would be extremely inclined to never use 
anything other than CC-BY.

That is what is sounds to me, Luke - For example Nature Publishing Group
when you publish with them, authors retain the copyright but provide NPG
with exclusive rights through a publish to licence agreement (in lieu of
copyright transfer). To my unlawyered eyes what Elsevier are doing is not
too different.

Thanks Marc,
 I will request the actual contract - I have found in more than one journal
that what authors sign is not necessarily what is on the website (and to
the author's disadvantage). The legal document may also be more easily
interpreted by lawyers.

Cheers
Fabiana

Response from lawyer #1

"You retain copyright, but that just gives you the right to be properly
attributed and get credit, i.e. you retain the moral rights.  But what you
can do with the work is the same as any other user under the CC licence,
which means that you cannot publish and distribute that work, beyond the
scholarly rights to create certain derivative works."

So, it looks like in the Elsevier model you pay for the CC-licence, and
then give up all author's rights to only retain "users rights" (and the
standard authors rights for scholarly use). Apparently one also gives up
the right to distribute the work even under CC-BY  (and by extension it
would seem this is a right that users also wouldn't have) and I think that
is a big right to give up.

This seems like nonsense to me - my human readable version of this is "pay
me to get a cc-licence and then give me back most of your author rights for
free."  Going in my list of "not worth your money" OA journals I think.

It's not an "outside" agreement, it's an agreement that *you* agreed to be
legally bound to.  That's the great thing about freedom -- you can agree to
anything you want!  Give away as many or as few of your rights as you feel
you've been adequately monetarily, or otherwise, compensated for...

Perhaps Lawyer #1 would like to be attributed by name for their

Tom

(and to clarify my earlier response, I'm neither a lawyer nor someone who

I know the MDPI people though haven't seen them for some years. They
started with "Molecules" which is a straightforward journal for publishing
chemistry and (may be) the largest collection of OA papers in main stream
chemistry. A few years after they started I wrote to them that their
licence was not compatible with BOAI and they changed it very quickly to
CC-BY.

I use their papers as a resource for extracting chemistry but I haven't
published there. For Molecules the charge =1800 CHF ==1250 GBP approx.

I have no recent experience but believe they are a competent OA publisher.
Whether it's value for money I have no opinion. I think they are reasonably
technically competent on production, though I have found unusual fonts in
the PDFs.

So I would have no current reservations.

P.

Yes - with the reservation that it's not easy for me to find CHF 1800.  I
think Ross will be interested.

Message-ID: <CAMnV1zpTRzDC+WCfGe3VbODUuM4+TttbQfhkAmdyW5hH76VA5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello OKFN Open Science folks -- some of you may be interested in the third
annual Public Lab conference in Louisiana -- community environmental tech
development, prototyping, fieldwork, open hardware, etc during three days
at a wetlands research center in about a month. See below:
*
*
*Public Lab enthusiastically invites you to join our 2013
Barnraising<http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-2013>,
October 4-6 at LUMCON Research
Station<http://www.lumcon.edu/Information/about.asp> in
Cocodrie, Louisiana. This year's theme is Education, *and there is still
plenty of room for proposing sessions, un-conference style.

*What is a Public Lab barn raising, you ask?* This is the closest thing we
have to a Public Lab conference -- but with an emphasis on "doing stuff
together" rather than just presenting/talking. In the spirit of bringing a
community together to collectively raise a structure such as a barn, Public
Lab comes together to develop tools, toolkits, supporting materials such as
guides and tutorials, test the tools and develop new research directions
and projects. Participants represent a wide range of interests from
technologists and designers to social scientists and community organizers.

*Find more information here:
*http://publiclab.org/wiki/barnraising-2013*,* including
a fantastic video of our 2012 Barnraising.

There is no fee to attend, only a $20/night lodging cost.

*Oh, and did I mention we go boating and kite flying every afternoon? ;)*

Please contact me with any questions. * *
Yours,
Liz

This is a useful discussion point.

I stand by what I wrote - in the field of chemistry and materials my
analysis of the papers and the editorial board (of Molecules) seems fully
satisfactory. See http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules/editors which has
many people I know and many Nobel Laureates. The journal has been going for
17 years and I have no evidence that these people are on the board without
their knowledge.

ALL journals can have rogue papers. Some years ago J.A.C.S published a
paper on Sodium Hydride oxidation (sic)  whose argument was rubbish (
http://totallysynthetic.com/blog/?p=1903 . The blogosphere tore it to
shreds in 24 hours including repeating the experiment. No competent referee
could have allowed it through. Yet it took about three years for the ACS to
issue a retraction. I see no real difference with the current climate
science paper. Wiley published a worse one (in Proteomics, on the relation
of the soul (sic) to mitochondria
http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2008/feb/13/thankstocjv5040forputting).
I myself have been been on the editorial board of a journal and asked
to
review an appalling paper - I said on no account should it go through - and
it did.

So it isn't appropriate to criticise a publisher on one bad paper. Who
knows, it may even get retracted. (I haven't read it). It may even be an
appropriate viewpoint even if not mainstream.

Some publishers have complete journals which are rubbish and which break
all the rules of peer-review. One Elsevier example is
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elsevier#Chaos.2C_Solitons_.26_Fractals where
hundreds of unacceptable papers have been published. But that wouldn't stop
me publishing with Elsevier. (I have stopped for other more valid reasons).

I have no evidence one way or another than MDPI has more or less
unacceptable journals and papers than any other.

For any journal I would be concerned if there was widespread documented
malpractice which had been reported and no action had been taken. And if
this were true for a number of journals from a publisher I could be
concerned for the publisher. I have no evidence of this in this case.

RE: MDPI

Phil Lord has written a positive, but honest review of his experience
publishing a paper in an MDPI journal here:

So yes, I gather MDPI are competent publishers

OK,
Let's take this as an example of the pluses and minuses of journals.

I am not a supporter of the journal as container. We need to find ways of
assessing the article without the journal. In the current case I have read
the titles of the current articles and the authors. On a quick skim they
look worthy articles, honestly written. I would tend to trust the author's
judgments as to what they write and rely on referees to pick up possible
problems.

For reference I did an invited article for Serials Review (Elsevier) about
3-4 years ago - before I joined the boycott. The experience was awful. It
was an open access issue and (I believe) we were promised the articles
would always be visible. In fact they put them behind a paywall after a few
months. I spent about 100 emails trying to get the journal to accept HTML
as the submission format.  AFAICR there was no peer-review that changed the
article - it went in as submitted.

So I have an article in SR. No-one reads it. The JIF is a staggering 0.9 or
something (not that I care). More people have read it on Nature Preceedings
and DSpace @ cam than ever anyone did on Elsevier's pages (they don't gives
stats anyway).

So I have everything to gain by moving to MDPI. People will or will not
read the article because of what's in it, not because the publisher earns
billions USD / year. They might even make their decision because Bjorn is
the  editor and I am the  author.

Hi All

Michelle and I are out in Cape Town for the open science for development
workshop we announced to the list a while back:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/07/20/open-science-for-development/

If you want to come and meet up we would love to hear from you! Do
circulate to any people you know in Cape Town who may be interested in open
science (or open knowledge generally!)

Best wishes

Jenny

To: okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org


Hey all,

I'm heading out to Cape Town next week with Jenny Molloy (Open Science
Working Group coordinator) to run an open science workshop alongside Open
UCT. While I'm out there, I would be really keen to meet up with as many
people as possible from the Open Knowledge community!

Mark Horner (CEO of Siyavulaha) very kindly found us space for a meetup at
the* Open Innovation Centre, Cape Town*, from *19:00 on 10 September*. More
details can be found here:
http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/Cape-Town/1021072/

Come share tales of your projects and activities, and find out about what
others are doing! I'm hoping we can have a series of lightning talks, so
please let me know if you would like to talk, and I'll add you to the list.

If you really can't come along and join us, but fancy a coffee on Monday or
Tuesday, let me know. I've got some free time on those days at present, and
I am really keen to use it to meet up with interesting people in Cape Town.

Best wishes,
Michelle

I'm on the editorial board of MDPI's _Publications_.
http://www.mdpi.com/journal/publications/editors

So are some other people I know and trust, including Bo-Christer
Bj?rk, Andr?e Rathemacher, and Carol Tenopir. (BTW, the entry for me on the
editorial board web page is out of date.)

I was introduced to MDPI years ago by Francis Muguet, a completely honest
and very hard-working chemist, lawyer, and activist for OA.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Muguet

I've seen blog discussions on whether MDPI is (or is becoming) predatory.
I'm sensitive to these. On the one hand, I've seen no evidence to date that
MDPI is a dishonest operation. On the other hand, as soon as I do, I'm
prepared to step down.

In that sense, I welcome further discussion of MDPI's track record. Every
journal should be open to continual scrutiny. At the same time, I'm
delighted that Bjorn will guest-edit an issue of _Publications_.

 workshop - follow us in Cape Town
Message-ID: <CABPM+wp3qY4rLgnMVFBCUcLXzBn6cuZdvtNZ-=Wbzk-7iocvGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

The IDRC funded and OKF/OpenUCT organised workshop on open and
collaborative science for development started today at the University of
Cape Town!
You can find the original blog post here:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/07/20/open-science-for-development/
The project proposal here:
https://sites.google.com/a/okfn.org/opensciencedev/our-mission

Follow us on *#openscidev* and *#openscience* - we would love your
engagement and interaction over the next two days so please tweet back your
thoughts and comments!
We will be blogging each evening and posting summaries to our discussion
group https://sites.google.com/a/okfn.org/opensciencedev/discussion for
more in depth debate.

Do spread the word and get in touch via these routes - input and
perspectives from those in the global south would be particularly
interesting for us as we try and build a research agenda to better
understand the challenges and opportunities in applying open approaches to
science for development.

Best wishes

Jenny

Subject: [open-science] New PDF Table transcription for CrowdCrafting/PyBossa
Message-ID: <CAGS_vfqtd-2j7UYv0_mhh9p8GA3iiY4Agy9OMpKHJ0tbUcWKMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there!

Today I'm really happy to announce a new application/template for PyBossa
that can be used in CrowdCrafting.org for transcribing tables locked in PDF
files :-D

The application is very similar to the PDF transcription
one<http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftranscribe/>,
as it is a new version of it, but showing how you can integrate a tabular
data library to format the transcriptions easily.

The application basically loads a PDF file (that can be hosted in your
public Dropbox folder!) and asks you how many columns the table has in the
page, if any. Then, if the answer is 5, a new table will be automatically
created, adding new rows everything you complete one! Simple and clean!

Each row is stored as a list in a JSON object, making really easy to parse
it and export it to other formats.

Here you have a short Youtube video showing the app:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfnJHALzlZc

The application: http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftabletranscribe/

And the official Tweet:
https://twitter.com/teleyinex/status/378474287532744704

NOTE: this app works really well, when in each page there is only 1 table,
and there are no cells joined. For other cases, the template should be
adapted, this is just the minimum version to work with. The handsontable
library <http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftranscribe/> is really awesome, so
you can adapt it to your needs without problems.

All the best,

Daniel

Hi again,

I forgot to mention that this application could be a really nice addon to
OCR tables, where the data is not perfectly transcribed. The handsotable
library can be populated with
data<http://handsontable.com/demo/prepopulate.html>,
so you would be able to OCR the document first, then, create a task in
CrowdCrafting with the OCRed data, so the table is pre-loaded for the
volunteer, then, the user can fix and improve the results of the OCR :-)

Cheers!

Hello all,

This email talks about an upcoming effort to develop the Wikipedia
article on "open science" at the the Open Knowledge Foundation
conference 16-18 September in Geneva and online. The request is that
anyone who is able should consider submitting something to that
Wikipedia article - or to this list for those unfamiliar with
Wikipedia - so that people can learn more about open science. The rest
of this email talks about that - there is no need to read further if
you are not interested in participating.

Why this matters
One way to describe open science is to say that it is the idea that
all science intended to be made available should be made available.
Right now there are barriers to collaboration in science, including
inability of researchers to read papers (lack of open access) and
inability of researchers to share data (lack of open data).

Since the Wikipedia article on "open science" is the first returned
result for a search engine query on the topic, securing the usefulness
of this Wikipedia article is probably a prerequisite to anticipating
that mass media will ever talk about open science and thus encourage a
social movement.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science>

How anyone can help
The easiest way that anyone can develop any Wikipedia article is to
make sure that all major sources describing a topic are at least cited
and mentioned in the references section of that Wikipedia article. If
sources are not identified, then no one can develop the article.
Please look at the sources already cited and if anyone knows a
fundamental source of "open science" not mentioned in this article
then please post it on Wikipedia or if that is not possible, mention
it in this mailing list.

Otherwise, anyone can edit Wikipedia at any time. Feel free to jump in
by going to any Wikipedia article and clicking "edit" at the top of
the page. If you do something wrong then I assure you that your
contribution will be salvaged and integrated by others.

Although the conference and drive to improve this article is 16-18
September, actually you can feel free to contribute to Wikipedia at
any time.

Who can do this
Stakeholders in the public perception of the concept of "open science"
should consider that at least this project will influence them, just
because this article will be for the foreseeable future the central
source of information on this topic. Anyone who likes can give input.

This effort is being organized by Ceyla of HackYourPhD.org. She just
went on an international open science tour and documented an oral
history of open science. She will be at OKCon in Geneva and can assist
people at that conference. I [[user:bluerasberry]] on Wikipedia or
lane at bluerasberry.com can assist people on Wikipedia or otherwise
online.
<http://hackyourphd.org/en/> Ceyla - at the conference
<https://etherpad.mozilla.org/OKCon-OpenScienceHackDay> <------- Most
details planned here
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Bluerasberry> Lane - online only

The P2P Foundation is an organizational overseer in this effort.
<http://p2pfoundation.net/>

I would also like to advertise that there is a mailing list for the
Wikipedia community about internal policy on open access - open access
advocates may want to subscribe to this here.
<https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/openaccess>

Also I would like to advertise that I recognize the Open Knowledge
Foundation as a major international player in promoting community
discussion about open science and related topics.

Finally I would like to point to Gabriel Thullen and Brian as active
Wikipedians who live in Geneva. I have no idea whether they might be
able to say hello to any open science fans attending this conference
but they do both know Wikipedia and they do what they can to promote
access to information in Switzerland and beyond. Gabriel is especially
interested in getting youth to edit Wikipedia and Brian contributes to
health content on Wikipedia.
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:GastelEtzwane>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Biosthmors> <--- pressed for time
but friendly online

Thanks for your attention! There is a concerted effort to improve
articles on open science and open access before the summer of 2014,
when at Wikimania, the international Wikipedia conference, we are
making a media push for recognition that Wikipedians and others need
access to information to make the articles that people are demanding!

Hi Lane

How are you?

The last steps of my travel were really busy. Since one week now, I've
had more time to put the last interviews online. I also wrote some
articles about Boston and Montr?al and I hope to finish my article
about NY tomorrow!

Here is your open science interview
I read also your comments about Kay's article about the Mozilla Science Lab.

Thats why I wanted t to let you know that we will certainly organize
an OpenScience wikisprint with the P2Pfoundation and Wikipedia during
the OKcon Hackday on sept 19th

Pierre Carl Langlais the french wikipedian PdD student is helping to
settle everything.
Here is the draft for different sessions we'd like to organize..
Your advice are welcome


Best

C?lya

I intend to help contribute to the(se) Wikipedia pages. I stated 4 years
ago that "the bit of Wikipedia that I wrote is correct" (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2009/04/06/wikipedia-has-won-how-can-we-convince-you/)
and I stand by that.

There isn't a real problem here. Every contribution that is made is
recorded to we can see what anyone wrote. If they use pseudonyms we make
our own judgments. If the sources are/not cited we make our own judgments.

The primary problem arises when there is an edit war. I think there may be
slight edit wars in "Open Access". As far as I can see WP has a reasonable
approach to edit wars - it identifies the problem. If the warring parties
are large and determined then there are few processes that can mend this -
but we go back to
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quis_custodiet_ipsos_custodes%3F .  We either
appoint an arbitrary custodian group or we let the dispute continue. I
prefer the latter.

In fact I don't think there is a current problem. I started the WP page on
"Open Data" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data  because even the phrase
"open data" was virtually unknown then (check the rev history!). It's not
"my" page but most of the words are still mine - there has been very little
major editing.

I believe what this shows is that our challenge will be to (communally)
write something good and find enough varied sources. I very doubt if we
shall have major differences of opinion at the start.

And if it's any good it will be preserved and can be reused elsewhere.

P.

I shall be there on Thursday but I really can't make a choice ATM - too
many I want to be involved with!

Note that if you select a doodle option you don't seem to be able then to
remove it and select "none"
P.

(my own experience of hackathons is that they often anneal in the first
hour or so of the day and commitment depends on who comes as much as
predetermined choices).

I applaud the suggestion to contribute to the Open science article in Wikipedia.

I wish to point out that there is an article on the same subject in the French version of Wikipedia, to which I contributed, but it's much less detailed (and satisfying) that its English language counterpart. I intend to contribute to the English language article, and to use it to improve the French version.

Two things I wish to point out to complete Peter's description of his experience with Wikipedia.

1. One of my main contributions to the (French language) article was largely deleted by an anonymous (see #2 below) author without warning or sufficient explanations. This weakened the article (in my opinion), notably by introducing some major inconsistencies. I don't know if this constituted an "edit war" (or "edit war declaration", as I didn't yet reinstate the former version), but one has to consider that Wikipedia strongly invites newcomers, even when in doubt, to edit articles.

My advice is that, especially when one considers removing or heavily editing parts of an article, one should announce its intention to do so in the Discussion page. If nobody objects after a reasonable delay (one could even receive useful feedback) one can then go on with the proposed editing. That's what I did instead of simply cancelling the changes.  I've noticed that the content of the Discussion page is sometimes as, or even more interesting than the actual content of the article.

2. About pseudonyms, and what one should conclude about "anonymous" pseudonyms. There are varying degrees of anonymity in Wikipedia. Non-registered users are "identified" by their IP addresses. Among registered users, hiding or revealing one's identity is not so much related to the pseudonym itself as to what is found in the user page (if it exists at all).

For instance, Peter's pseudonym (Petermr) is maybe less anonymous than 92.27.20.106 or, for instance, pseudos like Aencina or Jaamc. However, if I were to judge Petermr's a priori credibility as an author on a certain subject, I would find that Peter's user page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Petermr) gives us very basic information, certainly insufficient to adequately describe Peter's skills, which I've had the occasion to observe in this forum and others. As to Aencina and Jaamc: the former doesn't have a user page, while the latter can be easily identified at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Jaamc), where there's a link to his personal website.

I have amended my user page (which has not been updated for several years)
with a link to my Wikipedia entry. There was never an intention to be
anonymous - the  abbreviation "petermr" is widely used in many areas and
the top entry on Google for "petermr" brings up my blog where I am adequately
identified.

 *The Citizen Cyberlab & The Mobile Collective invite you to join us for an
evening of exploration and discussion about how Social Media can boost the
power of science in the hands of individual citizens, across the globe.*

REGISTRATION: http://socialmediaweek.org/london/events/?id=83971

This event will bring together creative minds from the world of Social
Media with scientists and others with an interest in Social Media or
Citizen Science. Together we will explore the possibilities for Social
Media within Citizen Science, using a ?thinkcamp? approach, in which the
participants themselves identify challenges and propose solutions for them.
What is Citizen Science?

Citizen Science is real science done collaboratively by amateurs,
volunteers, and enthusiasts around the globe. People are classifying
galaxies <http://www.galaxyzoo.org/> from their computers, monitoring
the health
of trees <http://www.opalexplorenature.org/ash-tree-news> in their
community, transcribing weather reports <http://www.oldweather.org/> from
old naval logs, and gathering data  <http://www.epicollect.net/>to make a
real contribution to scientific research. One emerging branch dubbed ?Extreme
Citizen Science<http://povesham.wordpress.com/2011/12/02/levels-of-participation-in-citizen-science-and-scientific-knowledge-production/>?
provides tools that can be used by any individual, regardless of their
level of literacy, to collect, analyse and act on information by using
established scientific methods. This allows any community to start a
Citizen Science project to deal with the issues that concern them ? from
biodiversity<http://www.nhm.ac.uk/about-us/news/2012/november/important-role-of-citizen-science-in-monitoring-uk-biodiversity117160.html>
to
food production, involving communities from housing estates in
London<http://www.london21.org/borough/news/show/25/1501/>
 to hunter-gatherers and forest villagers in the Congo
Basin<https://uclexcites.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/participatory-mapping-in-congo-brazzaville-part-1/>
.
What?s the role of Social Media?

Social Media include discussion
forums<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_forum>,
blogs, wikis <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki>, tweets, voting, picture
sharing and rating sites as well as social
bookmarking<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_bookmarking>.
 When mobile devices are added to the mix,  Social Media often involve
sharing real-time mobile information such as location (e.g. Foursquare)
media use as well as user-generated content, such as photos.

Many Citizen Science projects are now taking advantage of mobile phones and
tablets for easy data collection, such as iPhone apps for
monitoring<http://www.projectnoah.org/> birds
and marine wildlife or the NASA Meteor Counter
app.<http://meteorcounter.com/> Discussion
forums have always played a major role in Citizen Science, but the full
potential of Social Media for Citizen Science has only just begun to be
tapped.

Some examples of Social Media in Citizen Science projects:

   -

   GeoTag Libya<http://www.unitar.org/citizens-mission-unosat-reveals-new-cybermappr-crowd-sourcing-application>
used
   metadata from photo-sharing sites like flickr and twitter to geo-locate
   thousands of photos of  areas affected by military operations to help
   UNOSAT experts assess damage to civilian infrastructure.
   - Aurorasaurus <http://www.aurorasaurus.org/> uses twitter to aggregate
   and share real-time data about aurora borealis sightings around the world.


What is a ThinkCamp?

ThinkCamps create an open and stimulating environment for the sharing and
comparing of experiences, frustrations, skills and visions for the future.
There is just enough structure to allow you to discuss issues, flesh-out
ideas, and provide the right balance of expertise and support to act on
those ideas.

The ThinkCamp format <http://mobilecollective.wordpress.com/#recent> has
been developed by the Mobile Collective as  a collaborative approach to
tackling important challenges, by bringing together a range of experiences,
expertise and skills.  At a full ThinkCamp , we would aim to develop
proposals for action beyond the workshop itself. In our Mini ThinkCamp we
will be focusing on the cross pollination of ideas over a range of
expertise and experience. But of course we hope that you?ll be inspired to
action as well!
The Agenda

6:30     Doors open at the Dana Centre, drinks & nibbles

7:00     Open ?Taster? Talk ? introducing Citizen Science (Margaret Gold &
Brian Fuchs, of the Mobile Collective)

7:20     Science Wrap-Around ? the latest news from the coal-face about
Citizen Science and Social Media. (Muki Haklay, UCL ExCiteS and others)

7:45    ?Open Space? ? breaking out into Group Discussions at the tables,
with questions such as:

 1.   How can Social Media contribute to existing Citizen Science projects
and communities?

2.   What new kinds of Citizen Science projects are possible with Social
Media?

3.   How can Brands & Channel Owners use their reach to support
science-based-change in small communities around the globe?

8:30    Share & Tell ? a chance to share ideas that came out of the
break-out discussions with the whole group.

9:00 ? 9:30 Networking

DETAILS

VENUE = The Science Museum?s Dana Centre, 165 Queen?s Gate  London SW7 5HD

DATE & TIME = Tuesday the 24th of September,  open doors 6.30pm, event

Congratulations, you three. 

I had the joy of supporting Sophie's work, and Ross's and my paths crossed a few times as well. Let me know if you are science/data inclined, and need access to CC's resources or a contact in the Bay Area. It will be a pleasure to assist.

This is fantastic. We've had an exciting and difficult task selecting the
fellows who had to work hard - they had to make videos and do skype
interviews. We're also very pleased that at least two other finalists are
present at OKCon and offer all our encouragement to them.

Please read the blogs because one of the roles of the Fellows is to make
new contacts, hopefully visit and talk with people who have overlapping
interests and complementary skills or resources.

I'm patenting a genetic engineering method so that I can make it freely
available through an open source licence. Does anyone know of good open
source licences for intellectual property, so that this concept, and any
others that use it, will remain in the commons, available to all?

Yesterday, the Biodiversity Data Journal (http://biodiversitydatajournal.com/)  has been launched. The next open access journal by Pensoft, but this time with many advanced features on what and how to publish scientific data and again based on Taxpub, a NLM/JATS based taxonomy domain specific enhanced DTD.

 

It also includes the automatic registration of new scientific names at the respective name servers.

Well worth reading?.

 

Cheers

Hi,

The Open Science Wiki workshop is taking a good shape. You can find  
here the presentation page on Wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Workshop/Open_Science_Workshop_%28Geneva%29

The main aim is to ? map ? the open science movement, both on a  
semantic (what does it mean?) and social (who does it?) viewpoint.

To achieve this target, the workshop comprises several platform:
*The P2P Foundation wiki.
*The English Wikipedia.
*The French Wikipedia: https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Atelier_Science_ouverte
*Twitter with a devoted hashtag, #OpenScienceWiki.

I've created a header in order to switch easily from one to another  
platform. They are mostly complementary.

We can do on the P2P Foundation wiki a lot of thing that would not be  
conceivable on Wikipedia, such as recording open science projects  
regardless of their notability. Yet, the more academic process of  
Wikipedia contribution ensures a solid state of the art of open  
science definitions and features. I have for instance initiated a page  
to indicate all the major references and work on the topic: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Workshop/Open_Science_Workshop_%28Geneva%29/References

The workshop is open to everyone curious about open science. That  
probably includes you. We are hoping for a good deal of external  
contribution.

Hi Brian,

If I understand you correctly, this was Richard Jefferson's main focus with
Cambia. Relevant PDF is here:

http://www.cambia.org/daisy/cambia/3123.html

The WIPO delegate at my session on Thursday at OKCon will I think be
talking about patent pools. We'll be posting recordings.

Dear Pierre,

Another tool for your list would be http//slidewiki.org
SlideWiki allows to collaboratively create multilingual OpenCourseWare,
which also helps to organize knowledge about a scientific domain. An
example is our Semantic Data Web lecture: http://slidewiki.org/deck/750
which is meanwhile available in 11 languages. We are currently preparing
the next open-source release of SlideWiki, which will be available next
week.

Best,

S?ren

Hi all,

I'm replying to the mailing list I'm on. I just wanted to reply despite not
knowing much about patent law because I am hoping you don't need to patent
something to protect it, and would like you to consider this before
resorting to a patent.

You can select friendly licenses that have no restrictions on them for use,
which would not relate to a patent or lack thereof. patent != license.

Instead of patenting something to protect it, could you publish it to
establish it as prior work so that no one can patent it after you've
published it?

Are there legal precedents to show that this strategy would work?

These are the questions I'd ask myself before resorting to a patent.

Remember that patent law, unlike copyright law, is exclusionary rather 
than enabling. This makes the construction of open systems via licensing 
much more difficult and complex.

So, in order to "open source license" the method, first you have to 
obtain a patent, which will be restricted to the countries where you 
have filed to obtain it. This will require 2-4 years and tens of 
thousands of dollars or relevant currency to obtain, depending on how 
many different jurisdictions you look to obtain protection. At that 
point you can use the CAMBIA BIOS license (which impose a form of 
patent-left in that signatories to the license who make improvements to 
the technology must recontribute those improvements for free to all 
other signatories of the license) or you can use something like the 
BioBricks patent toolkit 
(http://openwetware.org/wiki/The_BioBricks_Foundation:BPA). At that 
point you can plausibly say you've "open sourced" the method.

If you are denied the patent, then the method falls into the public 
domain, which is also clearly open source - indeed one might argue truly 
free - but you will not be able to impose *conditional behavior* a la 
GPL or copyleft, including the condition of attribution.

Even if you get the patent, all it allows you to do is bar others from 
practicing it. It does not create the necessary rights to enable others 
to practice it under an open license. Those rights may be controlled by 
third parties who have other patents that bear on your method, which you 
may or may not know about in advance. Thus it's possible to patent a 
method, license it openly, yet be unable to practice it at all due to 
thickets of patents held by third parties who do not wish to be part of 
an open source culture.

Richard Jefferson likes to use the example of a chair with three legs (a 
stool in english). Richard patents the three-legged chair and licenses 
it under CAMBIA. But someone else holds the patent on four-legged 
chairs, with broad claims to other kinds of chairs, and got that patent 
before Richard. That person can therefore plausibly claim Richard's 
patent infringes his patent - even if Richard's patent is granted - and 
then neither Richard nor his open licensees can make, sell, import, or 
otherwise do things with three-legged chairs.

Copyright will protect the expression of the method - the copying of the 
paper in which it is disclosed - but not the actual practice of the 
method. Thus it is plausible that someone could access a copy of the 
method in a browser, not make a downloaded copy of it, practice the 
method in the lab, and fail to attribute you in later publications, and 
you would have no recourse under copyright law. This would be an 
instance of a *professional violation* of the norms of citation rather 
than an infringement of copyright.

In general I prefer the public domain in non-copyright matters, because 
the power of license-constructed commonses is in many ways a creature of 
the worldwide standardized power of copyright - an immune response to 
the overreach of the system. Patents and methods (and data) are governed 
by different systems and are simply less vulnerable to the aikido that 
Stallman discovered in copyright.

Will this workshop be webcast in any way?
I would definitely be interested to participate.

Dear all,

Here is a reminder that, I hope, will answer all these questions and clear
doubts that may subsist :)

* the satellite event is to be held *tomorrow*, Thursday, 19 September;
* venue, schedule, etc. were announced here:
http://okcon.org/open-science-and-research/session-b/
* proposals for projects to work on + the Doodle allowing you to pick the
project you are willing to work on:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/09/14/okcon-open-citizen-science-hackday-submissions/

You are still able to pick a project. The people who have proposed the
projects will be responsible for setting up the ways remote participation
will happen. Stefan and myself are around to help out in this. There will
be very possibly a pad and perhaps a Skype/Hangout ongoing. Not sure yet
for the latter as we'll be all together in the same room :)

Looking forward to meeting you tomorrow, in person and online :)

Rayna

That is my understanding and one of the drivers behind efforts such as
defensive publications http://linuxdefenders.org/projects on the Linux
Defenders page. You need to publish in certain places to have higher
likelihood of turning up in the right searches for prior art though
(unless you want to pay to litigate later, which can be far more
expensive than obtaining patents). I thought this was a reasonable
strategy to defend against patents in open systems.

Indeed! But you said it: proper text and it is not an image :-)

Yes, that's what I basically said after my first e-mail, that the
application I've created can be actually populated that way. However, bear
in mind that for some specific groups the knowledge required (and IT
skills) to do all the tasks could be challenging. For these reasons, the
CrowdCrafting.org solution involve more or less few simple steps:

1.- Upload the PDF file to your own Dropbox Public folder
2.- Copy the public link of it
3.- Copy the PDF Google Spreadsheet doc template, and replace the URL and
number of pages that you want to transcribe with the new one
4.- Import it in your CrowdCrafting app and you are done!

But again, don't get me wrong, I totally agree with you. Using first an OCR
is much better :-)

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi F?lix,

Thanks a lot for sharing your project with the e-mail lists! I forgot about
it, hehe, but I've tweeted it :-D

I would also like to say thank you for re-using my PDF transcription table
template, and for championing this project using CrowdCrafting.org. As you
said, I also think CrowdCrafting.org has a great potential for social
hacking.

Your project make me remember another example, similar to yours:
http://crowdcrafting.org/app/heradsdomar/

In this case, a citizen like you, decided to analyze the conviction rates
of judges in Iceland. I wrote a blog post about it one all the data was
obtained and published:
http://okfnlabs.org/blog/2013/07/31/crodcrafting-data-journalism.html

Looking forward to write another blog post about your project with
hopefully similar amazing results!

All the best,

Daniel

Many thanks Daniel

Anders Pedersen and I had a constructive discussion about tables and their
taxonomy and I am looking at some of the ones he sent me. (As you know I am
looking at how machines analyze tables - I think this is directly
complementary to your application).

Many "tables" are not rectangular tables, but simply ways of laying out
information using Excel or HTML tables. Common problems are nested tables,
tables which concatenate tables, merged cells etc. Others simply chane
semantics at random places.These are objectively difficult to describe! I'm
not aware of a formal classification of this problem but it would be
valuable. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_%28information%29 hints at
the problem]

Yes, disclosing the method puts it into the public domain and renders 
the method itself unpatentable, at least in theory. In practice, small 
modifications to the technique could make it novel enough to receive at 
least limited protections that in turn can be used to make broad 
assertions of the patent. That's what good patent attorneys do, and why 
they are highly paid.

There used to be a patent disclosure program that basically guaranteed 
your method got in front of the examiners, but the US discontinued that 
in 2007. http://www.uspto.gov/patents/law/disclosure_document.jsp

There is a company that promotes research disclosures as a defensive 
mechanism, too. http://www.researchdisclosure.com/publishing-disclosures

100% with you :-) The application/template I've created is for cases where
OCR is not enough, for example, for old documents where all you have is a
PDF with scanned images inside it and the cells are handwritten. The future
of these applications will be a mixture of an automated tool and the
verification by humans fixing errors and improving the algorithm (i.e.
feeding the humans output into the neural network to train it again).

Yes, the problem is much bigger than simple tables! Probably with all our
efforts we will end up with a platform that will be very useful for almost
all scenarios :-)

I just wanted to let you know about our event this weekend ? the Science
and Tech Forum: Los Angeles. We have a great lineup, so I?m sure it is
going to be a really excellent weekend ? the agenda is available here:
http://scitechforum.org/agenda ** **

** **

We will be livestreaming the event, so people who are not able to make it
to LA can watch and enjoy the program. You can find the livestream here:
http://new.livestream.com/uscpharmacyschool****

****

We start at about 9am PDT on both days, which I think is 5pm in the UK. Any
help in promoting the livestream to the Open Knowledge community would be
very appreciated!****

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEyYCaO1y8FvVSa0D4UoTqRMvKTEx=o26vanmhfxU5G1aA@mail.gmail.com>

fyi

Thank you for your interest in attending the Berlin 11 Satellite
Conference for Students & Early Stage Researchers on November 18th,
2013 in Berlin, Germany!
Our Organizing Committee has been hard at work behind the scenes, and
we are excited to announce today that the conference website is now
online at http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11.

We are also excited to share that the conference will include
presentations from Jack Andraka (Winner, 2012 Intel Science Fair),Alek
Tarkowski (Former Member of the Board of Strategic Advisors to the
Prime Minister of Poland), Cameron Neylon, (Director of Advocacy for
the Public Library of Science), and Heather Joseph (Executive Director
of SPARC).

This exciting, first of its kind meeting reflects the importance of
students and early stage researchers as the next generation of
scholars and the impact these groups are already having in opening up
scholarly communication. The conference will convene a discussion with
leaders and innovators in the Open Access movement about the current
state of Open Access and what participants can do to be catalysts for
change locally, nationally, and beyond.

On the conference website, you can now apply to attend the satellite conference.
http://www.righttoresearch.org/act/berlin11/apply
The short application shouldn't take much time and is necessary to
ensure a diverse, representative, and active group of participants for
this unique meeting. With generous support from the Max Planck
Society, many participants will have the opportunity to have their
travel and accommodation expenses covered by travel scholarships,
which you can request directly from the application!  Applications are
due by midnight on October 14th.

You can find more information, including a complete list of speakers
and available logistical details, on the conference website.

I hope you will apply today and look forward to seeing many of you at
the conference on November 18th!

Cheers,

Nick

Fantastic post, Peter. Lots of key points - reproducible computing/science,
open data, altmetrics, Austria... Read it.

Great to have met at OKCon. Anyone should feel free to contact Peter and
any other Panton fellows directly.

Hi All

I'd like to introduce you to Simone, who is reigniting activity over at the
Stockholm Open Science group (founded by Egon Willighagen) and hopes to get
local open science meetups and discussions taking place in Sweden.

http://science.okfn.org/2013/09/30/stockholm-open-science/

It's really useful to speak with like minded people locally and also look
at what can be done on a local level to facilitate open science activities
and policies so if you are based in Sweden and would like to get in touch -
head over to https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/stkhmos and introduce
yourself!

Please do spread this around your networks!

Jenny


Hi
I am Simone, senior post-doc at the department of medical biochemistry and
biophysics at Karolinska Institutet.
I decided to join this group in order to promote awareness toward OPEN
ACCESS. This concept has been pioneered in the computer community and
resulted in amazing progresses that affected not only the computer
community itself but the all world. In science open access found his way in
astronomy, particle physics and genomics.
I believe that a similar approach should be taken in many more branches of
science, especially in the medical field.

I know is not a simple task and in order to have such a big change, we need
to develop a new "scientific method" and slowly start a scientific
revolution. In order to be effectively able to share information we need to
change our way to do science, the way through which scientist are evaluated
and also how funding are distributed. I know it is a complex issue but we
need to start somewhere. I believe that we need to work on it from the
'inside' and start to build from the ground up a new way to do science.
Data generation, data crunching and even the classical "wet bench" science
changed a lot in the past few decades, however the way we are judged, we
get grants and communicate our research to the outside world is stacked in
the past. Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and start to do something.

Even if in many countries the economical crisis is hitting science really
hard, here in Sweden there is still the opportunity to be founded and do
science. The government has been pouring money in rich data projects such
as Scilife labs. VR is offering quite a few start-up grants and many
private foundations are investing in research. So I believe that this is a
good time to start to work in changing the way "we do science", to make
founding agencies aware that is "ok" to have full access to the data
generated with their founding and that by sharing we can do bigger jumps
and progress faster. Because I am a scientist I know that not everything we
do generate a figure in a final report, much of the work is saved in some
external HD for "who knows how long". We should be able to open up this HD,
share the negative data (of course getting credit for them) so if another
scientist will decide to follow a similar path, he or she will not have to
"re-invent" the wheel and deal with the same issues we previously
encountered.

Sorry for this long, long post. There is a lot that need to be fixed and
polished and I strongly believe that we as scientist have to start this new
scientific revolution.

Cheers,

Simone

Greetings Simone,
I love your vision and enthusiasm.

Breaking new ground is a hard road but with the help of community it is
much easier. Every year the number of like-minded people grows. I suggest
you concentrate on things where you can see a (clear?) way forward and
where you can make useful progress.

Egon has been magnificent - doing this for nearly ten years (he worked with
us in Cambridge in ca 2003 I think). He's been developing the semantic
concept in science (bio /chem).

7 years ago we founded the Blue Obelisk in chemistry to develop Open Data,
Open Standards, Open Source (ODOSOS) and that's quite a useful vision for a
lot of science. Jean-Claude Bradley and MatTodd have extended this to open
Notebook Science where the experiments are published as soon as they are
carried out. Not every one is able to do that.

Open Access technically refers only to scholarly publications and making
them available on the Internet. There's relatively little most people can
do other than to choose to publish in existing OA journals or self-archive
their papers. Some very energetic ones start OA journals and others get
involved in politics. OA has been going on for over 10 years. Generally
data is a separate area, Open Data

I suspect your interest is broader than OA and I'd suggest it falls under
Open Knowledge

Yes. This revolution is starting, but it's still very small.

The funders are now generally aware of Open Science and it's worth seeing
if they have programs (these will probably be small).  Open Science
overlaps with Citizen Science where people outside traditional academia are
involved.(probably most OS is CS, but not necessarily the reverse).

Many of find our own speciality in OKF and you might want to discuss ideas
on the list. It can also be very useful to run hack days - these are fun,
only require a room and perhaps some pizza. They are a mixture of
discussion and hacking information/software, though we are moving towards
physical objects as well ("maker"). You might want to consider building a
CrowdCrafting app...
