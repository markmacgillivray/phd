Dear colleagues,
as former a participant in the Network Kaleidoscope, you may remember that
one of the output of our project has been the launch of the TeLearn Open
Archive. We are planing to engage new initiatives to support the use of the
archive, and for that we would like to have a better idea of either your
knowledge and use of open archives, or of TeLearn in particular.
For this purpose we have designed a questionnaire not long to fill in.
Answering this questionnaire, that you will find at the following URL:
http://dev.telearn-archive.eu/index.php?sid=18296&lang=en
should not require more than 10 minutes.
Should you have any problem to do so, please contact
grenoble at noe-kaleidoscope.org
The access to the questionnaire is open until April the 30th, thank you for
taking this time to support the TeLearn initiative.
Best regards
Nicolas Balacheff

The World Digital Library (WDL) makes available on the Internet, free of
charge and in multilingual format, significant primary materials from
countries and cultures around the world.

The principal objectives of the WDL are to:

   - Promote international and intercultural understanding;
   - Expand the volume and variety of cultural content on the Internet;
   - Provide resources for educators, scholars, and general audiences;
   - Build capacity in partner institutions to narrow the digital divide
   within and between countries.

This is an interesting study:

  http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/preservation/nationaldata.aspx

Extracts from main findings
(http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/programmes/preservation/data_sharing_report_main_findings_final.pdf):

"In the increasingly international and interdisciplinary context of
research, locating data in disparate repositories in different
countries, gaining access to them through a web of licence agreements
in different languages, and re?using them in a multitude of file
formats can be a daunting task. These barriers are not easy to
overcome - the sheer diversity of data makes it difficult to design
tools with the range and ability to accommodate and translate between
the distinctly different data needs of the various domain
communities." (p. 3)

"Studies in the UK and Australia have demonstrated low awareness of
policies and requirements, and a lack of adequate data management
skills among researchers. Similar conclusions have been drawn from
digital library user surveys. Researchers require guidance in
translating policy requirements, including open access policy, into
operational tasks for which they can plan and take responsibility."
(p. 4)

"A significant agreement of common principles and standards amongst
the funding agencies for widening access to research data is being
stimulated by statements from international groups including the Open
Access movement." (p. 4)

"UK research funding organisations should jointly agree on data
sharing principles and develop a set of common criteria for their data
sharing policies." (p. 7)

"Data sharing policies should recommend data deposit in an appropriate
open access data repository and/or data centre where these exist." (p.
7)

"JISCLegal should provide enhanced advice and guidance to the research
community on all aspects of IPR and other rights issues relating to
data sets." (p. 8)

"Work by JISC and the research councils, on developing model licences
for data, should be co?ordinated so that a minimum set of standard
licences are adopted more widely." (p. 8)

The final report and and a summary of the main findings of a
JISC-funded study that compares national data infrastructures is
available from the JISC website.

This study was researched and written by Raivo Ruusalepp on behalf of

the references that are made, and the arrangements that exist, in a
number of OECD countries, relating to the sharing of research data.

Also of potential interest a workshop being run by NESTA next month on Open
Innovation on 15 May in London:

http://openinnovationandip.eventbrite.com/

"Please join us on Friday 15th May as NESTA, The Wellcome Trust and
the?Creative Commons jointly host a conference on open innovation and
intellectual property.? The conference will explore?whether and how?Commons
tools?can unlock innovation by making it easier for?artists, scientists,
researchers and businesses to share, collaborate and build on the work of
others.

Much innovation today is hampered by a lack of access to existing data,
content and facilities. In sectors such as biotechnology and
pharmaceuticals, a lack of openness leads to duplication of existing
research activities and significant effort down blind allies. In the
creative industries, the absence of simple, standardised licensing
arrangements which establish usage rights is arguably holding back
innovative online business models. Yet it is sectors such as biotechnology
and the creative industries which are otherwise best placed to lead the UK
out of recession.

James Boyle and John Wilbanks will give respective keynote speeches on the
Creative Commons and Science Commons as we explore the impact of the Commons
to date, and debate its strengths and weaknesses as a model for supporting
innovation.

This will be followed by two parallel sessions ?Commons models and IP in
healthcare? and ?Commons models in the creative industries? providing you
with an opportunity to explore the implications for the science/healthcare
sectors and creative industries, including contributions from: John
Wilbanks, Science Commons, James Boyle, Creative Commons; Iain Wilcocks,
Strategic Advisory Board for Intellectual Property; Sir John Sulston,
Institute for Science, Ethics and Innovation; Tony Wood, Pfizer and Richard

Open Data Commons have released a v1.0 "Release Candidate" of  the
"Open Database License" (ODbL):

  <http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/>

Full announce at:

(and inline below). Apologies in advance for any cross-posting.

## v1.0 RC ("Release Candidate") Announce

The Open Data Commons "Open Database License" (ODbL) v1.0 "Release
Candidate" is now available at:

<http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/>

This updated version of the license incorporates a whole set of
changes arising out of the earlier comments period and the main
changes are summarized below.

As the naming suggests, we believe this text is now very close to a
"production-ready" 1.0 license. To allow interested individuals and
communities time to review the latest set of changes, as well as to
provide an opportunity to catch any last minute "bugs", there will be
a *1 week comment period* starting today and ending at midnight next
Wednesday (6th May). *Full details on how to comment can be found on
the ODbL home page:

<http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/>

In preparation for the 1.0 release we have also prepared detailed
instructions on how to apply the license which can also be found on
the ODbL home page. Any feedback on these is also very welcome.
