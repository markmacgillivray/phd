Subject: [open-science] "I am an open scientist"
Message-ID: <AANLkTinW4k4Fc_Bdc7G=Vgnnx8+dG_zXg3yYmqQmG1dQ@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

i was at the open science summit this week/end along with peter and cameron,
and thought it was really inspiring if a bit organizationally messy. i was
bummed that no outputs were planned, but after many different people
asserting that they are "open scientists," I decided to start an etherpad,
to see if there was enough consensus to put together a "pledge" about what
that means, to publish and encourage people to sign, put badges on their
blogs, etc.

I think about 8 people contributed to it. The pad is here:
http://ideas.tinyhax.com/pledge

I'm curious if others on the list have any interest in working with this and
refining it into something we can release. IMHO the goal is not to develop
something with super formal requirements and metrics, but rather something
that reflects intentions and builds momentum around thinking of yourself as
an "open scientist".

Any interest?
Jessy

Some thoughts on what's missing in this policy debate right now:
http://blog.datadryad.org/2010/07/30/the-us-congress-and-selective-data-blindness/

It's great to see the emphasis on opendata.gov, and around open access publications.  But I am dismayed by the surprisingly tepid stance that US agencies like the Natl Science Foundations are taking regarding the availability of science data collected with public grant dollars:

Think a bit more long-term. The NIH Public Access Policy didn't burst
full-formed from the head of Jove either.

There are serious problems -- social, cultural, and technical -- to be
solved before any kind of open-data mandate. Some are such that open
data is not even an option, e.g. personally-identifiable data in
human-subjects research (the danger of which is raised to a truly
nasty power because of the ease of reidentification via dataset
mashup). Others can be solved in time, e.g. data standards for
disciplines that lack them (namely, MOST). Others will take a lengthy
process of researcher education; I hope you don't think every NSF
grantee understands what they produce by way of data, much less how to
preserve, present, and share them.

Given that, the NSF could only be tepid at this early date. An
out-of-the-blue data mandate would have caused widespread
insurrection; this is a shot over the bow, a signal, a way to boil the
frog. Give them time; they'll turn up the heat.

Dear Open Science folks,

 

I am trying to put together a list of known archives for scientific data
- for Open Data and restricted access, pre- and/or post publication of
associated papers, and at the international, funder and institution
level (or all of the above).

 

I would appreciate any suggestions you can offer. In short, where can we
host data?

 

Best regards,

 

Iain

This is a large field and I would try to split it into disciplines and find
people in each to report. If you/we are trying to be fairly comprehensive
it's probably a lot of detailed work.  I am currently convinced that this
has to be done on a per-discipline basis (
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2519 ).

A comprehensive list would be a great resource and I will happily share
the list of suggestions received (if preferable replies can be sent to
me direct rather than the whole Open Science list).

 

However, at this stage a not-so-comprehensive overview of what we know
is out there would also be very valuable. Obvious candidates are Dryad,
UKDA, PANGAEA etc but I'm sure there are many more.

 

Best,

 

Iain

At the Open Access Directory (a wiki), we've had such a list for a couple of
years.

We'd welcome help from any quarter in making it accurate, comprehensive, and

I'm sorry but I am afraid I won't be able to join as I am away for
conference in Oxford... for a long while I was hoping that the day
program would have been ended in time, but no luck...

Following up on tonight's Skype session, I would think it is best to
keep shaping the ideas for the individual papers for a while, which
can be done in the existing
http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers .

I have also set up
http://panton-papers.okfnpad.org as a more dedicated option, and we
could start filling
http://panton-papers.okfnpad.org/Overview
there with the structure of the series that is emerging in
http://okfnpad.org/science-20100804 .

Once we have reached workable consensus there, we can use the running
titles of the individual papers as the titles for the corresponding
pads.

Hi Greg, hi all,

thank yo for your speedy and useful summary,
for first afterthoughts, I suggest we continue on http://okfnpad.org/science-20100804

> Thanks again for taking the fire alarm fiasco in stride!

my pleasure, 
let's thank pmr for his sure intuition that your newcomer CK will handle this ;-)

----
PPapers CONCEPT for the series

hands up, please ;-)
who is planning to continue the conceptual work for the PPaper series on
http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers
?
methinks we need some version management now (4 August --> here)
or continue elsewhere?
it should be great to use collaborative spaces only (by which I mean to suggest: no blogs ;-)

----
from Greg's summary:
> ? * Claudia made it clear that Cellular Therapy and Transplantation will 
> ? ? accept data as both supplamental and possibly primary publications. 
> ? ? With offer to work closely with CKAN on the creation of this 
> ? ? process.

would anyone from CKAN be so kind as to get into touch with me on this issue?

----
thanks & cheers,
?
Claudia
who is looking forward to the next skype session(sorry, will be off "in the wild" @kungsleden in early September)

I would like to help out but my bandwidth is really limited for next two
months. I can probably drop in on whatever is the most recent document and
add ideas/comments from time to time and might be able to to do focussed
collaborative bursts if they are scheduled.

collaborative bursts sounds just great, Cameron,
so let's hope we get the schedules in track for you to catch the train
... and for us to enjoy your collaborative company :-)

still, we need to agree on what shall be "the most recent document"

more hands up, please
Claudia

The Open Data Journal is both free-of-charge for authors and readers (I
think because it has UNESCO support and most labour is gifted voluntarily).
Henry Rzepa and I published 2 papers in it in 2002. So If we don't worry
about the odious Impact factor - and rely on the per-article excellence of
what we write -  it may be a useful organ to consider publishing in.

As you can see from http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2526 I am
planning an ambitious event for #solo2010. If this succeeds it should give
the OKF high visibility in Science (there will be lots of media coverage).
I'm looking for help. This doesn't need to be chemical - it's primarily
organisational. For example providing a project page with names of OKF=based
helpers.

I would love to be able to show that the OKF is able to react to communal
Open data-driven projects. It's new ground for all of us. There is no risk
of failure other than apathy.

P.

London Citizen Cyberscience Summit

?2-3 September 2010, King?s College London

?The world?s first summit on citizen cyberscience will be held at
King?s College London on 2-3 September.



Citizen cyberscience is a growing trend where ordinary people use
their computers and the world wide web to contribute?in meaningful
ways to an increasingly wide range of scientific challenges.



Citizen cyberscience activity takes place all over the world and by
its very nature participants very rarely ? if ever ? meet. This event
will showcase a cross-section of these projects and will provide a
platform for scientists and citizens to share their thoughts on the
impact of citizen cyberscience face-to-face.



The summit will be hosted by King?s College London, and is organised
jointly by the Citizen Cyberscience Centre, based at CERN in Geneva;
the Centre for e-Research at King?s; Queen Mary, University of London;
Imperial College London; University College London and GridRepublic.
It is supported by the Shuttleworth Foundation, the Joint Information
Systems Committee (JISC), e-ScienceTalk and Microsoft?Research.



Confirmed speakers include David Anderson, director of the SETI at home
project, Space Sciences Laboratory, University of Berkeley; George
Dyson, historian and philosopher of science and author of ?Darwin
Among the Machines?; and Myles Allen, head of ClimatePrediction.net at
Oxford University.



There are currently more than 100 active citizen cyberscience projects
-?many address topical themes, such as modelling climate change
(ClimatePrediction.net) or simulating the spread of malaria
(MalariaControl.net). King?s staff will demonstrate how citizen
cyberscience can be applied to the cultural heritage sector through
the East London Theatre Archive project (elta-project.org).



The event will be of interest to both amateur and professional
scientists, to people who care about the impact of science on society,
and of society on science, and to those working in the digital
humanities and cultural heritage.



The Citizen Cyberscience Summit will take place on 2-3 September 2010
in the Anatomy Theatre & Museum?at?King?s College London?s Strand
Campus.?To see the full programme and to book tickets, see
www.citizencyberscience.net/summit. The event will also be webcast.

Peter,

Sounds good.  I've established a login at IsItOpen.  It looks like I need
some behind-the-scenes access to view the full email addresses of
previous correspondence?  I will wait for that and any other instruction
before moving ahead.

One thing I noticed is that the greenchem How can I get
involved<http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/greenchem:how-can-i-get-involved>
page
doesn't actually say how people can get involved.  Shall I add a sentence
suggesting that volunteers should send you an email, Peter, or ???

Heather

I think Rufus is the most likely person to know, or possibly Jonathan Gray.
I didn't actually code anything.

Please do, although it's probably a good idea that they leave their name on
the Wiki to make sure they don't get forgotten.

Apologies for cross-posting.

I thought everyone should be aware of the new Creative Commons Public Domain Mark and the ability to perform cut-and-paste citation from inside the CC0 "human readable" deed. I have detailed the work in a blog post at http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2010/08/i_am_cribbing_significant_amou.php - please feel free to ask me questions directly if you are interested. 

We expect to build a significant amount of normative infrastructure around the citation capability in our partnerships with the larger open science players who are already using CC0, such as Sage Bionetworks (hopefully this will provide some useful functionality to the Sage Cite project), Personal Genome Project, Polar Information Commons, and our emerging work on open energy and climate change data. And hopefully the PDM mark will begin to gain some traction with larger, governmental entities in the coming months to ensure that the bedrock of open data is as open as it can be...

Dear All,

As you may already know, there has been a lot of discussion on the web in the last 24 hours regarding 'Rare Sharing of Data Leads to Progress on Alzheimer?s (NYTimes)':- http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/13/health/research/13alzheimer.html?emc=eta1

May I propose that this article/discussion is put on the agenda for the next monthly meet up of the OKFN's Working Group on Open Data in Science.

As Glyn Moody put it so well (IMHO) on Twitter yesterday, " this should be the norm, not 'rare' "

Thanks,

gks

This is an excellent high-profile example of Open Data. Do you have
suggestions as to how we can take this forward.

There is so much happening in this area now that we have to work out what is
the best use of our resources and how to get more people involved. Maybe we
shoudl use this and others as picked examples of why Open data works - a
sort of prospectus.

Unfortunately not everyone will be convinced and in chemistry it's really
tough.

Peter/All,

The issue here to me that I'd like to see more widely discussed is who actually has access to such 'open data'.

I'm 99.9% certain that I read a comment yesterday, that gaining access to the data from the Alzheimer's dataset requires a log-in/approval. 

There was a similar situaion in June in terms of Pharma data from failed Alzheimer's drug trials being made 'open'.

If you mean that the data are not effectively OKD-Open then this is worth
advertising. Logins often creat pseudo-walled gardens where you cannot
extract the whole data. This is very important.

Graham - you may be thinking of my comment.  I tried to access the dataset
but it required either registration or registration and filling out an
application.  I don't know if this disqualifies it as truly "open" but from
a practical standpoint I think allowing anonymous access to data and
enabling referring via a simple URL are very important for promoting its
use.

Some of my colleagues are working with part of these data (mainly MRI
scans), and I am registered for their site as well, using the data
mainly for testing purposes.

I agree that their conditions for access to data are more open than
those of most research projects in the neuroimaging field,
but think that they are miles away from the kind of open data sharing
that is common practice in genetics or astrophysics and the goal of
OKFN.

Things are complicated by the need to balance openness of the data
with privacy of the participants in the study.

For more details, see

Hullo OKFN,

We've drafted a letter to send to publishers on behalf of the OKF through
IsItOpen, requesting clarification on journal policies with respect to Open
Data.  We've received feedback on the draft from several sources and the
letter has improved greatly as a result.  Your turn!

Please have a look at it here:
http://okfnpad.org/isitopenLetters

and add your comments and suggestions.

Although we aren't in a rush, we'd like to send the email out relatively
soon so please comment in the next few days?

Thanks!

Many thanks for your rapid and dedicated help, Heather. I have added some
notes at the end to cover some of the points we discussed, include those
raised by PeterS.

I am visiting Iain_H at BMC today and hope to have a few minutes to discuss
this. That should give good feedback from a mainstream Open Access
(OKD-compliant) publisher.

Subject: [GRG] fundraising for mitochondrial uncoupling research
To: Gerontology Research Group <grg at lists.ucla.edu>


I see that the Immortality Institute is fundraising for a mitochondrial
uncoupling project to take place in a Singaporean lab:

http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2010/08/fundraising-for-mitochondrial-unc
oupling-research.php

Project proposal:

http://www.imminst.org/forum/index.php?app=custompages&module=view&section=d
isplay&do=show&pageId=2

This sort of low-cost crowdsourced fundraising - combined with two-way
dialog between researchers and donors, plus a great deal more incremental
transparency in reporting on the research than is usually the case - is
something that should be encouraged. It is the future of research, just as
diverse and distributed open source software development was the future of
coding back in the 1960s. When the cost of modest research projects is
comparable to the cost of self-publishing an illustrated book, as is getting
to be the case, you will see all of the business models currently used in
the art-publishing industry migrate into life science research. e.g. ransom,
straight donation, multi-patronage, etc. This is an important trend and sea
change, and one that bears watching. Those of you who run labs and ride herd
on postgrads will, I predict, be seeing an increasing fraction of your
funding arriving this way as time goes on and costs fall.

(Though it will, I think, require a round of successful startups for
coordinating science funding that operate something like the Kiva model for
the very control-oriented universities to start paying attention to what's
going on here).

Looks a great opportunity for a scientist interested in governmental process



*JOINT EPSRC AND POST POSTGRADUATE INITIATIVE 2011*

*DEADLINE: **1 October 2010***

A three month secondment opportunity to the Parliamentary Office of Science
and Technology (POST) open to EPSRC funded PhD students.

*E**LIGIBILITY*: All EPSRC funded postgraduate students registered for a PhD
or EngD who will be in their second or third year (or fourth year for
Industrial Doctorate, Engineering Doctorate, or Centres for Doctoral
Training candidates) of full-time study in March 2011, are eligible.

*SCOPE*: During his/her time in Parliament, an EPSRC/POST Fellow should
expect to produce a POSTnote, contribute to a longer report, or assist a
select committee in a current inquiry.  The Fellowship will involve:

   - Identifying and liaising with a wide range of interested parties
   including industry, academia, regulatory bodies, non-governmental
   organisations and government.
   - Drafting concise briefing materials.
   - Responding to comments from internal and external peer review.

There may also be opportunities for Fellows to organise seminars to inform
or disseminate their work.

*FUNDING*: The successful applicant will receive a three month extension to
their PhD funding, EPSRC will make arrangements to reimburse the additional
costs to the university to ensure that their stipend will continue to be
paid while based at POST. When a candidate is based at POST, computing,
email and other facilities necessary for the project will be supplied by
POST.
Fellows are expected to spend as much time as possible working in POST's
offices in Westminster.

*APPLICATION PROCEDURE*: Applicants should submit to EPSRC by 1 October
2010:

   - A completed application form (available at *
   http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/other/POSTApplicationForm.pdf
   *<http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/SiteCollectionDocuments/other/POSTApplicationForm.pdf>),
   which has been approved by their Head of Department or principal supervisor.
   - A two-page briefing on the topic of ?Volcanic Ash?


The fellowship is for three months and may be carried out from March 2011,
but candidates should try to avoiding starting in June, July and August,
which are the summer recess months.

Dear Open Science folks,

 

Just a short note to let you know that the 2010 BioMed Central Open Data
Award nominations are now open.

 

http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/opendata/

 

Building on experience from the 2009 award (awarded in June 2010) we
have provided space for nominators to comment on how harvestable and
re-usable the data are, and to what extent the data being made open goes
beyond cultural norms of their domain.

 

http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/opendata_nominations

 

Any feedback and, of course, nominations gratefully received.

 

Best regards,

Hi all,

PMR and I (on behalf of OKN) sent a few IsItOpenData enquiries yesterday
(BMC, PLoS, Nature, Mendeley), and already have one very positive response
from PLoS<http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/78d7400e-6d5e-4510-aff1-0d106bb9fcfa/>
.

I have two service functionality questions/suggestions to add to those
below, based on using the system:

   1. My link-heavy enquiry email unfortunately tends to be identified as
   Spam.  We might want to alert enquiry-writers to this possibility on the
   composition page, and either suggest they use few links or send an
   out-of-band personal email to give the recipient a heads-up.  Of course this
   increases the likelihood of (c) below.  Any other suggestions to avoid spam
   filters?
   2. Are the enquiry-writers alerted when they receive a response?  It
   doesn't appear so.  This is quite inconvenient, and could lead to delayed or
   incomplete resolution.  Would it be easy to add?

Thanks,
Heather

This is great. They say they have to be clearer about data, so I think we
should push them gently on the actual factual questions and also persuade
them to add licences/buttons.

I do not fully understand the response... at one place I think they
say the data is CC-BY and at other places they say it is conform the
Panton Principles (CC0 or PDDL or any other public domain waiver)...
which is it?

We've got a long way to go in making clear all of these distinctions. And at
the same time we don't want to put off those people acting in good faith
either. I know there are initiatives at both BMC and PLoS looking at how to
handle this. It will require changes to the licensing arrangements (to have
authors explicitly make data, intepreted generously as PD) as well as
changes to the declarations made on each paper so its going to be tough but
I think working with PLoS and BMC to come up with some good examples of how
it can be done is the way forward here.

BMC are for instance putting Open-Data buttons on figures and supplementary
data but while this is a nice declaration of what you can do it needs to be
backed up with a licence/waiver that makes it happen. To do that you need to
modify the publication agreements between author and publisher to make
explicit the licensing arrangements for different components of the overall
work. Which can't be done retrospectively really. So lots of work for the
future.

Cheers

Cameron

Iain from BioMedCentral has kindly offered to place a Panton
Principles banner on the BMC site. Anyone interested in working on a
banner? Suggest we try to produce a few then vote? ;-)

We could blog about this and ask people to add prospective banners to
e.g. a Flickr group? What do folks think?

All the best,
