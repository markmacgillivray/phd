Hi all,

 

If not already seen via Twitter or the BMC Blog, we recently published
the first article in BMC Research Notes received in response to our call
for contributions on data standards, sharing and publication that went
out in September:

Subject: [open-science] Making science more accountable and efficient
Message-ID: <4D56E5FA.3040304@informatik.uni-leipzig.de>

Hi all,

I just subscribed to the list, so please forgive me if you discussed a 
similar topic already earlier.

I'm regularly doing reviews for journals and conferences in computer 
science and I notice, that still many papers describe approaches and/or 
systems, but the underlying software and data is not (publicly) 
available. From my point of view this substantially hinders 
reproducability, reusability, and peer-reviewing of scientific results 
and thus efficiency and accountability of science in general.

I know there are the Panton Principles, but I think (although its good 
to have them) they are too strict to be applied in the general case for 
the following reasons:

1. its not only about data, also algorithms and their implementations in 
terms of software need to be made available

2. sometimes it is acceptable to have this data, algorithms, software be 
releases publicly, but not under an open license.

I imagine some kind of manifesto, which stresses the importance of 
making scientific artifacts (i.e. data, software, models etc.) 
available, maybe in different gradations similar to the LOD start badges 
[1]. The gradations could be:

0. The scientific artifacts underlying a scientific publication are not 
made available.

1. The scientific artifacts underlying a scientific publication are made 
available in a limited way, which do not yet enable complete 
reproducability.

2. All scientific artifacts underlying a scientific publication are made 
available to the public, they enable complete reproducability but the 
license they are made available under imposes restrictions potentially 
limiting the reuse.

3. Data is published according to the panton principles and all software 
underlying a scientific publication is made available under an 
open-source compatible license.

Once such a manifesto with these gradations is produced, journals and 
conferences can link to it and require submissions to classify 
themselves according to these criteria (and maybe that precedence will 
be given to more works).

Has someone of you seen something like this already? If not do you think 
the creation of such a manifesto is useful and would you be interested 
to work with me on that?

Have a nice Sunday everybody,

S?ren

I think we woudl all agree this. For example Cameron Neylon is heading up a
new Open Access journal:
http://www.openresearchcomputation.com/

The reason for Panton was that the role of data was poorly formalised and we
felt that the process for making it Open could be formalised and
evangelised. In a sense this is already true for software - if it's Open
Source then it's available and the challenge is to persuade mor people to
make software Open Source - evangelism/advocacy rather than mechanics.

Processes are much more difficult to describe but I suspect that we shall
start to see efforts to define Open Scientific processes including
intrumentation, data capture, methodology and materials.

Can you give me some pointers to these related initiatives?

I think for software (Open Source), creative works (CC) and data (Open 
Data) we have these standards already, what other scientific artifacts 
are there? Maybe models (like UML models, ontologies, taxonomies, 
experimental architecture models) - I guess one of the other categories 
might fit for them too, e.g. ontologies/taxonomies could be considered 
as Open Data or creative works in terms of CC.

Also, openness (as I said in my initial email) is not the most important 
issue here - if an artifact is not open for good reasons, but it is at 
least made available to the scientific community and public for 
peer-review evaluation purposes, this is already a big step forward to 
what we have now.

> Second problem is that you need to go from zero adoption to wide
> adoption before you can have an effect.

I think you have already an effect if one conference or journal requires 
authors to classify their work according to the suggested criteria. All 
authors submitting to this journal or conference will have to think 
about it and since the rule applies to all submission to this particular 
science outlets its also fair. In fact if we would manage to get a few 
good science outlets in a certain field on board this could be the start 
of a paradigm shift in that field.

I think this fragmentation actually is counter productive. Ideally this 
would be tackled with one set of principles and/or manifesto and I would 
be more than happy if my ideas, for example, could be integrated into 
the Panton principles (although I doubt this would be possible, since it 
would require quite some substantial changes).

> As John pointed out Victoria Stodden has essentially described what
> the gold standard should be.

I think making openness the gold standard and requiring scientists to 
release their data under CC0 can not be a model for science in general. 
There are many cases where its actually acceptable that data, software 
etc. to be released under different terms and this should not be 
neglected. However, the terms should be made explicit and there should 
be always a publicly available version for peer-review and evaluation 
purposes. At least for computer science, I think this would in the end 
indirectly dramatically facilitate openness, currently I have the 
impression many computer science researchers "hide" their artifacts more 
because their implementations are not robust and usable enough than 
because they are against openness. If there is preassure (from journals 
and conferences) to make it publicly available, they have to improve 
usability and robustness anyway and then they will also make it 
available in truly open ways.

The Open Access movement effectively split (or at least bent) over whether
papers should be simply visible (self-archiving) or whether they should be
certified as Open (e.g. CC-BY) and points on the specturm. Stefan Harnad's
argument was that we should first campaign for "green" OA and when all
authors had self-archived, only then should we aim for "gold" or CC-BY (I'm
conflating the concepts slightly).

With Panton we felt that :
* there was an identified problem (data was published and not labelled)
* that there was an unawareness of the need to publish data
* that the initiative could be taken forward without assembling large
committees
* that it would have a catalystic effect bot on data and also other types of
publication.
* that it had a good probability of success.

Most of these are sociopolitical, not ethical concerns, and based on
pragmatism. So we would argue that Panton has helped to take one section
forward, created high awareness and has not done harm to the wider cause
(i.e. people are not saying  "we've solved data, there's nothing left to
worry about").

We have the same spectrum as in politics. For example in campaigning for
human rights some people will address a specific area (e.g. prisoners) where
others will address the world political process, other address education,
etc.

So (for me at least) it's a matter of judgment not logic or conflicting
ultimate goals.

Subject: [BOAI] ?last call for a terminology suggestion

In the February issue of SOAN, I called for?reader help in coming up with a short, sweet term for author-side openness, for example, the openness of wikis to user edits. ?If "open access" is openness to readers and other users, human and machine, what's a good analogous term for openness to authors?

http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/02-02-11.htm#contest

This is a last call for suggestions before I start to write up the results for the March issue of SOAN. ?Send me your ideas at peter [dot] suber [at] gmail [dot] com. ?I'll assume that I may name and quote you unless you tell me that I shouldn't.?

Dear All

Our last meeting was very productive, and as the current Panton Papers are
due to be at first draft stage by 15th Feb (get collaborating at
http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers!), we'll meet again just after that
deadline. This is quite advance notice so I'll send a reminder closer to the
date!

When:      Wednesday 16th February at 17.30 GMT
Location:  #okfn IRC channel on oftc.net (quick link http://ur1.ca/4fh) and
Skype (add your Skype ID to http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011)

Please add your name and Skype ID to the list of attendees on
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011
Add anything you'd like to be discussed or new ideas to the agenda (even if
you can't make it yourself, just make sure you add enough details).

Thanks very much, and I look forward to speaking to you all soon.

Jenny

My deepest apologies, but I am scheduled to give a presentation today 
during our meeting time so I won't be able to make it.

I did update the agenda with my update of the DataRights PantonPaper to 
keep everyone in the loop.

Best,

Dear All

See below for a summary of key points from the WG meeting on Feb 16 2011,
I've listed here the main updates, followed by a list of things you could
contribute to and any interesting events that are coming up. If you'd like
more detailed updates on projects or to view the full minutes, visit
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011

The next meeting will be Wednesday 9th March, 17:30 GMT.

-------------------
Updates:

Panton Papers Drafts:
The PP drafts are ongoing, please see the meeting Etherpad for an update
from Greg on his Intellectual Property and Data paper and see previous
emails for more information on who is doing what.

Advertising the working group and collaborative activities:
There are many groups with similar interests to our own, a few potential
groups to get in touch with are listed on the Etherpad but please feel free
to add others!

CKAN Package Parties/Hack sessions:
One way to collaborate with other subject specific groups could be to
organise short time periods where we work to add/curate data packages on
CKAN within a certain theme and make Is It Open? requests as applicable.

Egon Willighagen introduced the meeting to the topic of linked open drug
data http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG/LODD/Data. There is already a group of
packages added to CKAN http://ckan.net/package/lodd_group but we could add
others and send requests where the openness of data is not clear. A package
party is provisionally scheduled for Monday March 7th at 19:00 GMT, for
about an hour. More details to follow, but please put the date in your
diary! If you know any other open sciencers in your area, why not make it a
physical meet up? Preferably with cake, which always improves both
attendance and productivity.

Hopefully this will be a regular activity, so if there is an open science
data theme you think needs attention, please bring it up at a future
meeting.

OKCon Science Participation:
The call for participation at the Open Knowledge Conference 2011 can be
found here http://okcon.org/2011/cfp/. It would be great to get plenty of
open scientific data related proposals, so please forward this to any people
or organisations you think would be interested.

There is a list of where the CFP has already been sent on the OKCon Etherpad
http://okcon.okfnpad.org/2011.

Open Science Working Group page:
The home of the working group http://science.okfn.org/ currently has a
lovely but irrelevant landscape as its page header. Suggestions were sought
for a new image and Amrapali has offered to generate an open science themed
word cloud using http://www.wordle.net/.
Watch this space for an image revamp!

We also hope to embed or link to a calendar listing all meeting dates and
relevant conferences and events submitted by group members or tagged as open
science related on http://lanyrd.com/.

------------------
Things to Do!

1) Join the linked open drug data package party on Monday 7th March, 19:00
GMT
2) Send the OKCon CFP to any people/organisations you think might be
interested in participating http://okcon.org/2011/cfp/<http://bit.ly/cFgi94>
3) Continue collaborating and commenting on Panton Paper drafts, see the
meeting minutes at http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011 and
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-meetings for more information.

----------------
OKF/Open Science Related Events:

30 Jun/1 Jul - OKCon at Kalkscheune, Berlin (www.kalkscheune.de), see the
website at http://okcon.org/2011/ for more details and to register.

Actually, that record is not a group, but a catalog record itself...
see my thoughts I wrote up this morning:

http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2011/02/ckan-and-rdf-nice-example-on-why.html

I did create an actual group, to which I will add the currently listed
12 data sets LODD 'redistributes'...

I have send around this meeting within the LODD group, and several
participants will join in.

Right now, it would be good to get those CKAN definitions tuned for
what is supposed to be in a record. I have outlined some problems in
that blog post given earlier, and hope that this can be the start of a
general clean up effort...

Whom should we talk to, to get those definitions of what is a
'dataset' worked out?

Announcement

The 6th Annual Open Knowledge Conference (OKCon) will take place on 30th June ? 1st July 2011 in Berlin. OKCon is a wide-ranging conference that brings together individuals and organizations from across the open knowledge spectrum for two days of presentations, workshops and exchange of ideas.

Open knowledge promises significant social and economic benefits in a wide range of areas from governance to science, culture to technology. Opening up access to content and data can radically increase access and reuse, bridge gaps, improve transparency and thus foster innovation and increase societal welfare.

In Berlin, we will be surrounded by a variety of interesting communities. These include open access and open bibliography communities to the OpenStreetMap, hacker and artist groups to the various free culture and commons research communities. We look forward to jointly discussing with all of them the latest developments and aspects of open knowledge in their work.

This is a time of great change. In addition to high profile initiatives such as Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap and the Human Genome Project, there is enormous growth among open knowledge projects and communities at all levels and in many countries. Moreover, in the last year, many governments across the world have begun opening up their data.

And it doesn?t stop there. In academia, open access to both publications and data has been gathering momentum, and similar calls to open up learning materials have been heard in education. Furthermore this gathering flood of open data plus content is the creator and driver of massive technological change. How can we make this data available, how can we connect it together, how can we use it to collaborate and share our work? We will explore these issues, and more, at OKCon 2011 in Berlin.

Topic areas

We welcome proposals on any aspect of creating, publishing or reusing content or data that is open in accordance with http://opendefinition.org. Topics include but are not limited to:

Open Data Technology

	? presentation sessions
	? lightning talks
	? hands on workshops
	? open space
	? exhibition spaces
	? open design and fablab
	? hackspace

We are especially interested, if you want to organize a an event in one of the above formats and topic areas. You are also more than welcome to propose additional formats and topics. If you would like to organise, participate or have a proposal of another format please submit your ideas and proposals here: http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

OKCon Formats & Submission Details

Presentation Sessions
To reserve a slot in one of the presentation sessions you can apply in the following manner: You can submit an extended abstract of 2-4 pages describing the topic of your presentation. OKCon also has an academic stream and will publish proceedings. If you additionally want your submission to be included in the conference proceedings please prepare an extended 5-10 page paper submission and format it according to the LNCS Style

Please Note: Proceedings of OKCon will be published at http://ceur-ws.org.

To make a submission for the presentation session and proceedings please visit:https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=okcon2011

Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are short presentations, which last 2-3 minutes with 2-3 slides. Submission of lightning talks can be done directly at the conference up to 5 minutes before the Lightning talk session starts. Make sure you get your message through and please: don?t be boring ;)

Hands-on Workshops
The hands on workshops is the format where you can intensively work with a relatively small group of people on your presented topic or project. This is not for lectures but for hands-on collaboration, exchange and skill sharing. If you are interested to run a workshop on OKCon 2011 please submit your proposal here: http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

Open Space
The open space offers a place for all kind of spontaneous interventions, meetings and the like following the concept of the open space technology. The open space area will be close to the exhibition space area and is open for you all the time. The open space can be used all times by anybody without submission. However, if you would like top run an event at the open space you might submit your idea here: http://okcon.org/2011/submit/ to help us planning.

Exhibition Space
The exhibition space is an open area where people, projects and organisations can present their ideas and projects to the public. Projects can have a permanent desc for a point of reference of their project. If you want to be present in the exhibition space at OKCon 2011 please submit your proposal here: http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

Open Design and FabLab work area
The open design and Fab Lab (fabrication laboratory) is an area dedicated to open processes in creating, sharing, reusing and producing of all kind of art, designs and other products. If you are interested in contributing to the open design and fablab work area at OKCon 2011 please submit your proposal here: http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

Hackspace / Hackathon
The hackspace is a dedicated space for you hackers. This is the right place to get your hand dirty and organise your hackathon. A hackathon is a collaborative decentraliced event of short timespan like one or two days with the aim to having a lot of fun with code & data. If you are interested to run a hackathon at OKCon 2011 please submit your proposal here:http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

Subject: [open-science] Call for participation: Survey on barriers to
 Wikipedia participation among scientists/academics
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=xq5T07oSBvvgN--pYFLDS2J-w1UJ2DH36Qooq@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,


[Apologies for cross-posting]

We would value your contribution to a survey we launched some days ago to
understand expert barriers to participation to Wikipedia:
http://bit.ly/ExpertBarriers.


Context

Wikipedia is increasingly used by university students for "pre-research", to
gain context and explore ideas for course assignments and research projects
[1]. Yet many among scientists,

academics and other experts are reluctant to contribute to Wikipedia,
despite a growing number of calls from the scientific community to join the
project [2-3].

The initiative

The Wikimedia Research Committee [4] has just launched a survey to
understand why scientists, academics and other experts do (or do not)
contribute to Wikipedia and other collaborative projects, and whether
individual motivation aligns with shared perceptions of Wikipedia within
expert communities. We hope this may help us identify ways around barriers
to expert participation. The survey is anonymous and takes about 20 min to
complete. Please help us circulate the link among your colleagues and
collaborators:

Hi All

I've posted this to the CKAN discuss list as well because they may be better
placed to address the points raised by Egon here:
http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2011/02/ckan-and-rdf-nice-example-on-why.html

For those who are new to this thread, the Open Science working group are
planning a package party/hack session on linked open drug data (Monday 7th
March, 19.00 GMT), but a couple of things have been identified which it
would be good to clear up first.

If someone with a good knowledge of CKAN workings would also be able to join
in with us on the night via the OKF IRC channel that would be fantastic :)

Actually, that record is not a group, but a catalog record itself...
see my thoughts I wrote up this morning:

http://chem-bla-ics.blogspot.com/2011/02/ckan-and-rdf-nice-example-on-why.html

I did create an actual group, to which I will add the currently listed
12 data sets LODD 'redistributes'...

I have send around this meeting within the LODD group, and several
participants will join in.

Right now, it would be good to get those CKAN definitions tuned for
what is supposed to be in a record. I have outlined some problems in
that blog post given earlier, and hope that this can be the start of a
general clean up effort...

Whom should we talk to, to get those definitions of what is a
'dataset' worked out?

To: public-semweb-lifesci at w3.org


Hi all,

on February 16 there was an OpenScience Workgroup [0] meeting of the
Open Knowledge Foundation, where we scheduled a work session for
Monday March 7th at 19:00 GMT, for about an hour, to work on
clarifying the data licensing of LODD data sets, such as those listed
on CKAN. For some data sets the license is clear, others have
non-commercial clauses (which is not considered "Open Data"), and
others do not specify the terms, or are not open at all. For example,
the below diagram a CAS node which is not open data at all:

http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG/LODD/Data

In fact, the unclear license issue was one of the referee comments on
the LODD contribution to the thematic issue on RDF in chemistry
(coordinated by Matthias).

Please let me know if interested in joining the meeting,

Egon

I have started an etherpad with details, where people can add their names:

http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-loddhack-201103

But...

I do like to focus on the Open Data side of the LODD data sets, and
use CKAN for annotation. I do not want the hour to be spend on finding
out how CKAN works; we'll have to do that on beforehand (and I already
started a group for this, linked in Jenny's email), and possibly
afterwards and use if they way we can.

Instead... in this hour I like to focus really on getting the 'Open
Data' nature of the LODD data sets clear. In particular, there are two
or three data for which we need to write an 'Is It Open Data?' letter
because they have no clear license/waiver/copyright information... and
we write letters for a few data sets which have a non-commercial
clause, making the data non-open, according to the Panton Principles
and CKAN too, I think.

That should have priority in this hour, IMHO, so that all participants
can sign. I do not want this hour to be a general information session
on Open Data licensing. That too, must be resolved before or
afterwards.

Does that make sense?

Egon

We've started a simple '2 minute' user guide for CKAN:

<http://wiki.ckan.net/Using_the_Web_Interface>

Please add/amend it as necessary.

Strictly CKAN.net has no restriction on the license of the data that
can re registered there though obviously we strongly encourage open
data (as per the open data buttons and the links to
isitopendata.org/).

Big +1.

This makes a lot of sense :)

Some of us were discussing on Tuesday aspects of coordination in the OKF and
particularly what activities newcomers could be involved in. The idea that
emegred was that a significant core part of OKF activity was requesting and
annotating Open Data. In particular we felt that newcomers to OKF could get
a feel for the ethos and community by making data requests using
IsItOpenData.

This is an activity that scales well (by country, language, discpline, etc.)
so that a newcomer to OKF can usually find something that is relevant to
them. By carrying out an IIOD/LODD activity in their area of expertise they
will find out those others in OKF who have similar interests.  If we can
identify clear simple tasks in this area it's a good way af getting
newcomers active and involved.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

Greetings, all.

We've been funded, for the last year or so, to study the way that ?big
science? projects manage and distribute their data, and to make
recommendations for how they should preserve this into the future.
This has culminated in a report which describes the way this is
managed now (it's rather different from the way it's managed in other
areas), some of the case for data preservation, and an account of the
practicalities and costs of managing data on this scale.

This report is now available in draft, and we welcome all comments. We
are particularly interested in comments on the recommendations that we
make. Are they practical? Should they be more specific? Do they cover
our remit appropriately?

The end of the MRD-GW project is imminent, and the report will be
finalised towards the end of March. If you can get comments to us by,
say, 14 March, we'll be able to incorporate them into the final
version.

The report is located at

http://purl.org/nxg/projects/mrd-gw/report

Please quote this URL rather than the one it resolves to, as the
document it resolves to may change and not all versions will be
immediately public (it's complicated). At the time of posting, that
document is version 6 of the report.

Do pass on the URL. Thanks for any thoughts.

Best wishes,

Norman

> Dear All
>
> See below for a summary of key points from the WG meeting on Feb 16 2011,
> I've listed here the main updates, followed by a list of things you could
> contribute to and any interesting events that are coming up. If you'd like
> more detailed updates on projects or to view the full minutes, visit
> http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011
>
> The next meeting will be Wednesday 9th March, 17:30 GMT.

> -------------------
> Updates:
>
> Panton Papers Drafts:
> The PP drafts are ongoing, please see the meeting Etherpad for an update
> from Greg on his Intellectual Property and Data paper and see previous
> emails for more information on who is doing what.
>
> Advertising the working group and collaborative activities:
> There are many groups with similar interests to our own, a few potential
> groups to get in touch with are listed on the Etherpad but please feel free
> to add others!
>
> CKAN Package Parties/Hack sessions:
> One way to collaborate with other subject specific groups could be to
> organise short time periods where we work to add/curate data packages on
> CKAN within a certain theme and make Is It Open? requests as applicable.
>
> Egon Willighagen introduced the meeting to the topic of linked open drug
> data http://www.w3.org/wiki/HCLSIG/LODD/Data. There is already a group of
> packages added to CKAN http://ckan.net/package/lodd_group but we could add
> others and send requests where the openness of data is not clear. A package
> party is provisionally scheduled for Monday March 7th at 19:00 GMT, for
> about an hour. More details to follow, but please put the date in your
> diary! If you know any other open sciencers in your area, why not make it a
> physical meet up? Preferably with cake, which always improves both
> attendance and productivity.
>
> Hopefully this will be a regular activity, so if there is an open science
> data theme you think needs attention, please bring it up at a future
> meeting.
>
> OKCon Science Participation:
> The call for participation at the Open Knowledge Conference 2011 can be
> found here http://okcon.org/2011/cfp/. It would be great to get plenty of
> open scientific data related proposals, so please forward this to any
> people
> or organisations you think would be interested.
>
> There is a list of where the CFP has already been sent on the OKCon
> Etherpad
> http://okcon.okfnpad.org/2011.
>
> Open Science Working Group page:
> The home of the working group http://science.okfn.org/ currently has a
> lovely but irrelevant landscape as its page header. Suggestions were sought
> for a new image and Amrapali has offered to generate an open science themed
> word cloud using http://www.wordle.net/.
> Watch this space for an image revamp!
>
> We also hope to embed or link to a calendar listing all meeting dates and
> relevant conferences and events submitted by group members or tagged as
> open
> science related on http://lanyrd.com/.
>
> ------------------
> Things to Do!
