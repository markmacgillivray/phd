Dear all,

let me give you a brief update about the Opening Science to Meet Future 
Challenges conference in Warsaw on March 11th:

   http://conference2014.ceon.pl/
   https://twitter.com/OSwaw2014

There will be four keynote speakers:
* Nicholas Canny, ?Making Open Access Work for All: Dream or Reality??
* Stevan Harnad, ?How to Formulate Effective Policies to Open Access to 
Research Worldwide?
* Cameron Neylon, ?From Network Architecture to Concrete Action ? 
Charting a Future for Open Research on the Web?,
* John Willinsky, ?What Is It About the Intellectual Properties of 
Learning??.

The *deadline for abstract submissions* has been *extended to February 
7th*, so on behalf of the organizers I warmly encourage you to submit 
abstract of your presentations!

As the conference is co-located with an OECD workshop on Open Science, 
we expect a good mix of stakeholders on Open Science.  Do join us!

If you have any questions regarding the event, I would be glad to answer 
them.

Best regards,

Lukasz

*Training for Open Science in Europe - get involved! *
http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/training-call-2014/

*Call for proposals to host FOSTER training events on open access, open
data and open science*

The FOSTER project (Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research,
http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/) aims to support different stakeholders,
especially young researchers, in practicing open access, open data sharing
and open science. FOSTER will support community training actions via two
annual open calls for events. The first call is issued in February 2014 for
events in June - December 2014, and the second call will be issued in
October 2014 for events in 2015.

Do you feel you can effectively train on open science topics? Can you make
a difference? We are now inviting proposals to host FOSTER training events
on open access, open data and open science to be held from June to December
2014. FOSTER will provide limited co-funding for events. With your help we
want to organize both engaging and instructive events that reach out to
diverse disciplinary communities and countries in the European Research
Area.

We are looking to support different types of training events and
strategies, ranging from short (one or two-hour) workshops, through to
summer schools. Some examples of the training formats and content that we
would like to support:

   - Training targeting graduate schools in European universities, e.g.
   summer schools, seminars, etc.
   - Courses for trainers/multipliers who can carry on further training and
   dissemination activities within their institutions, countries and/or
   disciplinary communities.
   - Workshops for researchers participating in community/disciplinary
   conferences.
   - Training in compliance with the open access policies and rules of
   participation set out for Horizon 2020.
   - Training in integrating open access and open data principles and
   practices in the current research work-flow by targeting young researchers.
   - Training targeting one of the stakeholders - academic staff
   (researchers and students), institutions (research administrators,
   librarians), research project managers, policy-makers and staff working  in
   funding bodies.

*FOSTER support*

FOSTER will provide assistance in shaping the training programme, selecting
training materials and speakers/trainers, etc. Co-funding for the events
will also be provided (such as cost of the venue, materials, travel of
speakers, etc.).

*How to apply and a deadline*

1. Describe the training goals, target audiences, budget needed and any
co-funding offered. Please fill in the application form which can be
downloaded here:
http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/form/training/FOSTER_Training_proposal_form.doc

2. Please submit your training application *no later than Monday, 17 March
2014* here: http://www.fosteropenscience.eu/form/training/.

3. If you have any have technical problems, you can email your training
application to iryna.kuchma[@]eifl.net

*Who can apply?*

Organisations from the European Research Area are eligible to participate.

*Evaluation procedure*

Funding will be granted on a competitive basis. Proposals will be selected
by FOSTER based on the following criteria:

   - Aims and topics of the event targeting open access and open science
   practices, in particular in relation to publicly funded research in Horizon
   2020 and national funding schemes;
   - Outreach potential (number of relevant stakeholders directly involved
   on the training event);
   - Potential for "multiplication" (institutional or disciplinary) of
   train the trainers programmes;
   - Level of engagement with Graduate Schools and embedding in standard
   curriculum;
   - National/regional diversity;
   - Disciplinary diversity;
   - Cost-efficiency.

Support will be provided to at least ten training programmes for academic
staff and students, research administrators and librarians, research
project managers and staff working in funding bodies.

Selected proposals will be notified no later than 30 April 2014.

*About FOSTER *

FOSTER (Facilitate Open Science Training for European Research), an
FP7-funded project, aims to accelerate knowledge and practice of open
access and open science, especially among young researchers, across all
fields. In addition, it will mobilize other stakeholders, such as project
managers, administrators, and librarians, in support of this aim.

Dear all,
I am trying to find out if there are open science initiatives in the area
of geo-microbiology.
this research area combines geology with microbiology for development of
better natural fertilisers. Especially for developing countries this work
holds great promises for crops improvement so research is closely linked to
practice.
If any of the visitors of this list is working in this area, knows people
who work in this area, can point me to sources for open access articles on
geo-microbiology please let me know.
final goal of the excercise is establishing an open science network for
this research field

What a great idea. Are there any phrases or entities that could identify
papers from the text or figure content? Then we could try to mine open
access papers.

possible key words are 'rock dust' , geomicrobiology, natural fertiliser,
soil microbiology, soil ecology, mineral fertiliser
The idea for this community is part of a proposal that I want to submit
 for a project in the IDRC  openscidev program.

Thanks Tom,
Thinking about the subject I think we can identify several simple
vocabularies:
* microbial species. We should be able to do this already
* metal ions and oxidation states (also possible)
* minerals by name (e.g. chrysotile)
* your keywords

The key to success is:
* the results should be useful
* people are prepared to contribute simple vocabularies - Ross created one
in a relatively short time.

The problem is access - EuropePMC probably doesn't cover much of this so we
need to identify journals and build a crawler.

hey,

as an outcome of the last local groups meetup, Keren Limor, Suchith
Anand and me are now coordinating the monthly meetups for europe, africa
and us timezones. To start this, we want to know which timeslot is best
for you, so please fill out the doodle. => This is only for the local
group coordinators/people!
http://doodle.com/nse42yeha3vbbc9s

The meetups will then be every month at the same timeslot, so it is
easier for everyone to plan for it. If you have any wishes or feedback,
let us know.

cheers, stefan

Message-ID: <DF5C4FB2277FEC4C824FEDC89906CAA845DB319C08@EXCHANGE3.ad.nottingham.ac.uk>

Dear All,

Could i also request you to inform your students (from all disciplines) about the NASA World Wind Europa Challenge http://eurochallenge.como.polimi.it/  and encourage them to apply.

This is an international competition and open to all on our home planet. See the 2013 Winners, China had one of the top teams last year. You can see last year's winning projects at http://eurochallenge.como.polimi.it/projects2013

The aim of this challenge is to inspire ideas for building great applications that serves the INSPIRE Directive and uses NASA's open source virtual globe technology World Wind.

This initiative  is co-organised by  Prof. Maria Brovelli and colleagues at  Politecnico di Milano, Italy who are part of our rapidly expanding "Geo for All" initiative and we strongly support this excellent initiative.

Best wishes,

Suchith

In what sense, Brent? Payments for what?

Do you mean "sustainability" i.e. paying so that things (like PDF-s) CAN be

11th Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC) 2014
Dates: May 25 - 29, 2014
Venue: Anissaras, Crete, Greece
Hashtag: #eswc2014
Feed: @eswc_conf
Site: http://2014.eswc-conferences.org
General Chair: Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)

- Ivan Cantador (Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, ES)


MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES

People generally need more and more advanced tools that go beyond those implementing the canonical search paradigm for seeking relevant information. A new search paradigm is emerging, where the user perspective is completely reversed: from finding to being found. Recommender systems may help to support this new perspective, because they have the effect of pushing relevant objects, selected from a large space of possible options, to potentially interested users. To achieve this result, recommendation techniques generally rely on data referring to three kinds of objects: users, items and their relations.

Recent developments in the Semantic Web community offer novel strategies to represent data about users, items and their relations that might improve the current state of the art of recommender systems, in order to move towards a new generation of recommender systems that fully understand the items they deal with.

More and more semantic data are published following the Linked Data principles, that enable to set up links between objects in different data sources, by connecting information in a single global data space: the Web of Data. Today, the Web of Data includes different types of knowledge represented in a homogeneous form: sedimentary one (encyclopedic, cultural, linguistic, common-sense) and real-time one (news, data streams, ...). These data might be useful to interlink diverse information about users, items, and their relations and implement reasoning mechanisms that can support and improve the recommendation process.

The primary goal of this challenge is twofold. On the one hand, we want to create a link between the Semantic Web and the Recommender Systems communities. On the other hand, we  aim to show how Linked Open Data (LOD) and semantic technologies can boost the creation of a new breed of knowledge-enabled and content-based recommender systems.


TARGET AUDIENCE

The target audience is all of the Semantic Web and the Recommender Systems communities, both academic and industrial, which are interested in personalized information access with a particular emphasis on Linked Open Data.

During the last ACM RecSys conference more than 60% of participants were from industry. This is for sure a witness of the actual interest of recommender systems for industrial applications ready to be released in the market.


TASKS

* Task 1: Rating prediction in cold-start situations

This task deals with the rating prediction problem, in which a system is requested to estimate the value of unknown numeric scores (a.k.a. ratings) that a target user would assign to available items, indicating whether she likes or dislikes them.

In order to favor the proposal of content-based, LOD-enabled recommendation approaches, and limit the use of collaborative filtering approaches, this task aims at predicting ratings in cold-start situations, that is, predicting ratings for users who have a few past ratings, and predicting ratings of items that have been rated by a few users.
The dataset to use in the task - DBbook - relates to the book domain. It contains explicit numeric ratings assigned by users to books. For each book we provide the corresponding DBpedia URI.

Participants will have to exploit the provided ratings as training sets, and will have to estimate unknown ratings in a non-provided evaluation set.

Recommendation approaches will be evaluated on the evaluation set by means of metrics that measure the differences between real and estimated ratings, namely the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).


* Task 2: Top-N recommendation from binary user feedback

This task deals with the top-N recommendation problem, in which a system is requested to find and recommend a limited set of N items that best match a user profile, instead of correctly predict the ratings for all available items.

Similarly to Task 1, in order to favor the proposal of content-based, LOD-enabled recommendation approaches, and limit the use of collaborative filtering approaches, this task aims to generate ranked lists of items for which no graded ratings are available, but only binary ones. Also in this case, the DBbook dataset is used.

In this task, the accuracy of recommendation approaches will be evaluated on an evaluation set using the F-measure.


*  Task 3: Diversity

A very interesting aspect of content-based recommender systems, and then of LOD-enabled ones, is giving the possibility to evaluate the diversity of recommended items in a straight way. This is a very popular topic in content-based recommender systems, which usually suffer from over-specialization.

In this task, the evaluation will be made by considering a combination of both accuracy (F-measure) of the recommendation list and the diversity (Intra-List Diversity) of items belonging to it. Also for this task, the DBbook dataset is used.

Given the domain of books, diversity with respect to the two properties http://dbpedia.org/ontology/author and http://purl.org/dc/terms/subject will be considered.


DATASET

* DBbook dataset

This dataset relies on user data and preferences retrieved from the Web. The books available in the dataset have been mapped to their corresponding DBpedia URIs. The mapping contains 8170 DBpedia URIs.

These mappings can be used to extract semantic features from DBpedia or other LOD repositories to be exploited by the recommendation approaches proposed in the challenge.
The dataset is split in a training set and an evaluation set. In the former, user ratings are provided to train a system while in the latter, ratings have been removed, and they will be used in the eventual evaluation step.

The mapping file is available at:
http://sisinflab.poliba.it/semanticweb/lod/recsys/2014challenge/DBbook_Items_DBpedia_mapping.tsv.zip 

It contains a tab-separated values file where each line has the following format: DBbook_ItemID \t name \t DBpedia_URI.

We suggest to extract a semantic descriptions for all the items present in this mapping file by starting from the DBpedia URIs.

The training sets are available at:


* Task 1: http://sisinflab.poliba.it/semanticweb/lod/recsys/2014challenge/DBbook_train_ratings.zip 

The archive contains a tab-separated values file containing the training data and a README describing its content. Each line in the file is composed by: userID \t itemID \t rating. The ratings are in scale 0-5. The training set contains 75559 ratings. There are 6181 users and 6166 items which have been rated by at least one user.


* Task 2 and Task 3:  http://sisinflab.poliba.it/semanticweb/lod/recsys/2014challenge/DBbook_train_binary.zip 

The archive contains a tab-separated values file containing the training data and a README describing its content. Each line in the file is composed by: userID \t itemID \t rating. The ratings are in binary scale. 1 means that the item is relevant for the user, 0 means irrelevant. The training set contains 72372 ratings. There are 6181 users and 6733 items which have been rated by at least one user.


ADDITIONAL DATASETS

Although not used in the challenge, two additional rating datasets linked to DBpedia are provided, namely the well known MovieLens10M dataset and the Last.fm dataset published at HetRec'11 workshop.

http://sisinflab.poliba.it/semanticweb/lod/recsys/datasets/ 

We encourage participants to use these datasets for testing the developed recommendation approaches on several domains.

MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES

Scholarly publishing is increasingly enabling a new wave of applications that better support researchers in disseminating, exploiting and evaluating their results. The potential of publishing scientific papers enriched with semantic information is huge and raises interesting and challenging issues. Semantic Web technologies play a central role in this context, as they can help publishers to make scientific results available in an open format the whole research community can benefit from.

The Semantic Publishing Challenge 2014 is intended to be the first in a series of events at ESWC for producing and exploiting semantic publishing data. The main focus this year is on extracting information and using this information to assess the quality of scientific productions.
Linked open datasets about scientific production exist - e.g. DBLP - but they usually cover basic bibliographic information, which is not sufficient to assess quality. Quality-related information are often hidden and not yet available as LOD. 

There is also a growing interest in alternative forms of publishing scientific data as (semantic) datasets that can be more easily shared, linked to each other, and reasoned on. Alternative metrics for scientific impact are also gaining relevance.

We are seeking the most innovative and impacting applications in this emerging contexts. 


TARGET AUDIENCE

The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia.


TASKS

The Challenge includes three tasks. Participants can participate in as many tasks as they like.


= Extraction Tasks =

We ask challengers to automatically annotate a set of multi-format and multi-source input documents and to produce a Linked Open Dataset that fully describes these documents, their context, and relevant parts of their content. The evaluation will consist of evaluating a set of queries against the produced dataset to assess its correctness and completeness. The input dataset will be split in two parts: a training/testing part and an evaluation part, which will disclosed a few days before the submission deadline. Participants will be asked to run their tool on the evaluation dataset and to produce the final Linked Open Dataset.


== Task 1: Extraction and assessment of workshop proceedings information ==

Participants are required to extract information from a set of HTML tables of contents, partly including microformat and RDFa annotations but not necessarily being valid HTML, of selected computer science workshop proceedings published with the CEUR-WS.org open access service. The extracted information is expected to answer queries about the quality of these workshops, for instance by measuring their growth, longevity, connection with other events, distribution of papers and authors.


== Task 2: Extraction and characterization of citations ==

Participants are required to extract information about the citations in scientific journals and their relevance. Input documents are in XML JATS and TaxPub, an official extension of JATS customized for taxonomic treatments, and selected from the PubMedCentral Open Access Subset and the Pensoft Biodiversity Data Journal and ZooKeys archive. The extracted information is expected to be used for assessing the value of citations, for instance by considering their position in the paper, their co-location with other citations or their purpose.


== In-use Task 3: Semantic technologies in improving scientific production ==

Participants are asked to submit demos that showcase the potential of Semantic Web technology for enhancing and assessing the quality of scientific production. 

The task has a completely open structure and is, in particular, independent from tasks 1 and 2: participants are free to decide which tool to show and which dataset to use.

The evaluation will be different from other tasks and will consist of two phases: after a first round of review, a number of submissions will be invited to demo their work at ESWC. The final decision will be taken at the Conference by a jury formed of PC members present at the event and other invited experts.

Further details are available at: http://challenges.2014.eswc-conferences.org/index.php/SemPub/Task3


EVALUATION

= Extraction Tasks 1 and 2 =

Participants will be requested to submit the LOD that their tool produces from the evaluation dataset, as well as a paper that describes their approach. They will also be given a set of queries in natural language form and will be asked to translate those queries into a SPARQL form that works on their LOD.

The results of the queries on the produced LOD will be compared with the expected output, and precision and recall will be measured to identify the best performing approach. Separately, the most original approach will be assigned by the Program Committee.


= In-use Task 3 =

Participants are required to submit a paper description as for tasks 1 and 2 and a demo version of the tool (open source appreciated but not mandatory).

The evaluation will consist of two phases: after a first round of review, a number of submissions will be invited to demo their work at ESWC. The final decision will be taken at the Conference by a jury formed of PC members present at the event and other invited experts. The winner will be selected according to its potential impact, originality, breakthrough, the quality of the demo, and the appropriateness for ESWC.

Further details about the evaluation are provided on the challenge wiki.


FEEDBACK AND DISCUSSION

A discussion group is open for participants to ask questions and to receive updates about the challenge (see link at bottom). Participants are invited to subscribe to this group as soon as possible and to communicate their intention to participate. They are also invited to use this channel to discuss problems in the input dataset and to suggest changes.


JUDGING AND PRIZES

The Program Committee and the chairs will select a number of submissions conforming to the challenge requirements that will be invited to present their work. Submissions accepted for presentation will receive constructive reviews from the Program Committee, they will be included in the Springer LNCS post-proceedings of ESWC, and they will also have a presentation slot in a poster session dedicated to the challenge. 

In addition, the winners will present their work in a special slot of the main program of ESWC and will be invited to submit a revised and extended paper to a dedicated Semantic Web Journal special issue.

Five winners will be selected. For each of Tasks 1 and 2 we will select:
* best performing tool, given to the paper which will get the highest score in the evaluation
* most original approach, selected by the Challenge Committee with the reviewing process

The winner of Task 3 will be selected by the jury according to its potential impact, originality, breakthrough, the quality of the demo, and the appropriateness for ESWC.

Winners will be selected only for tasks with at least 3 participants. In any case all submissions will be reviewed and, if accepted, published in ESWC post-proceedings.

An amount of 700 Euro has already been secured for the final prize. We are currently working on securing further funding.

 
HOW TO PARTICIPATE

Participants are required to submit:
* Abstract: no more than 200 words.
* Description: It should explain the details of the automated annotation system, including why the system is innovative, how it uses Semantic Web technology, what features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned. The description should also summarize how participants have addressed the evaluation tasks. An outlook towards how the data could be consumed is appreciated but not strictly required. Papers must be submitted in PDF format, following the style of the Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors), and not exceeding 5 pages in length.

Submissions for task 1 and task 2 also have to include:
* The Linked Open Dataset produced by the tool on the evaluation dataset (as a file or as a URL, in Turtle or RDF/XML). 
* A set of SPARQL queries that work on that LOD and correspond to the natural language queries provided as input
* Participants will also be asked to submit their tool (source and/or binaries, or a link these can be downloaded from, or a web service URL) for verification purposes.

Submissions for the in-use task 3 have to include:
* a demo version of the tool. The demo must be made available along with the paper submission but participants are allowed to refine it until the presentation at ESWC-14. 

All papers submissions should be provided via EasyChair:

MOTIVATION AND OBJECTIVES

Mining opinions and sentiments from natural language is an extremely difficult task as it involves a deep understanding of most of the explicit and implicit, regular and irregular, syntactical and semantic rules proper of a language. Existing approaches mainly rely on parts of text in which opinions and sentiments are explicitly expressed such as polarity terms, affect words and their co-occurrence frequencies. However, opinions and sentiments are often conveyed implicitly through latent semantics, which make purely syntactical approaches ineffective. To this end, concept-level sentiment analysis aims to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of text and provide novel approaches to opinion mining and sentiment analysis that allow a more efficient passage from (unstructured) textual information to (structured) machine-processable data, in potentially any domain.

Concept-level sentiment analysis focuses on a semantic analysis of text through the use of web ontologies or semantic networks, which allow the aggregation of conceptual and affective information associated with natural language opinions. By relying on large semantic knowledge bases, concept-level sentiment analysis steps away from blind use of keywords and word co-occurrence count, but rather relies on the implicit features associated with natural language concepts.

This Challenge focuses on the introduction, presentation, and discussion of novel approaches to concept-level sentiment analysis. Participants will have to design a concept-level opinion-mining engine that exploits common-sense knowledge bases, e.g., SenticNet, and/or Linked Data and Semantic Web ontologies, e.g., DBPedia, to perform multi-domain sentiment analysis. The main motivation for the Challenge, in particular, is to go beyond a mere word-level analysis of natural language text and provide novel concept-level tools and techniques that allow a more efficient passage from (unstructured) natural language to (structured) machine-processable data, in potentially any domain.

Systems must have a semantics flavor (e.g., by making use of Linked Data or known semantic networks within their core functionalities) and authors need to show how the introduction of semantics can be used to obtain valuable information, functionality or performance. Existing natural language processing methods or statistical approaches can be used too as long as the semantics plays a main role within the core approach (engines based merely on syntax/word-count will be excluded from the competition).


TARGET AUDIENCE

The Challenge is open to everyone from industry and academia.


TASKS

The Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge is defined in terms of different tasks. The first task is elementary whereas the others are more advanced. The input units of each task are sentences. Sentences are assumed to be in grammatically correct American English and have to be processed according to the input format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/sentence.

* Elementary Task: Polarity Detection The main goal of the task is polarity detection. The proposed systems will be assessed according to precision, recall and F-measure of detected binary polarity values (1=positive; 0=negative) for each input sentence of the evaluation dataset, following the same format as in http://sentic.net/challenge/task0. The problem of subjectivity detection is not addressed within this Challenge, hence participants can assume that there will be no neutral sentences. Participants are encouraged to use the Sentic API or further develop and apply sentic computing tools.

* Advanced Task #1: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis The output of this task will be a set of aspects of the reviewed product and a binary polarity value associated to each of such aspects, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task1. So, for example, while for the Elementary task an overall polarity (positive or negative) is expected for a review about a mobile phone, this task requires a set of aspects (such as 'speaker', 'touchscreen', 'camera', etc.) and a polarity value (positive OR negative) associated with each of such aspects. Systems will be assessed according to both aspect extraction and aspect polarity detection.

* Advanced Task #2: Semantic Parsing As suggested by the title, the Challenge focuses on sentiment analysis at concept-level. This means that the proposed systems are not supposed to work at word/syntax level but rather work with concepts/semantics. Hence, this task will evaluate the capability of the proposed systems to deconstruct natural language text into concepts, following the same format as in http://sentic.net/challenge/task2. SenticNet will be taken as a reference to test the efficiency of the proposed parsers, but extracted concepts won't necessary have to match SenticNet concepts. The proposed systems, for example, are supposed to be able to extract a multi-word expression like 'buy christmas present' from sentences such as 'Today I bought a lot of very nice Christmas presents'. The number of extracted concepts per sentence will be assessed through precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.

* Advanced Task #3: Topic Spotting Input sentences will be about four different domains, namely: books, DVDs, electronics, and kitchen appliances. This task focuses on the automatic classification of sentences into one of such domains, in the format specified at http://sentic.net/challenge/task3. All sentences are assumed to belong to only one of the above-mentioned domains. The proposed systems are supposed to exploit the extracted concepts to infer which domain each sentence belongs to. Classification accuracy will be evaluated in terms of precision, recall and F-measure against the evaluation dataset.


EVALUATION DATASET

Systems will be evaluated against a testing dataset which will be revealed and released after the first-round of evaluation during the Conference. The dataset will be made public on the challenge website. Participants are suggested to train and/or test their own systems using the Blitzer Dataset. The testing dataset will be constructed in the same way and from the same sources as the Blitzer dataset.


EVALUATION

The evaluation will be performed by the members of the Program Committee. For systems that can be tuned with different parameters, please indicate a range of up to 4 sets of settings. Settings with the best F-measures will be considered for judgment. For each system, reviewers will give a numerical score within the range [1-10] and details motivating their choice. The scores will be given to the following aspects:
1. Use of common-sense knowledge and semantics;
2. Precision, recall, and F-measure wrt the selected task;
3. Computational time;
4. Innovative nature of the approach.


JUDGING AND PRIZES

After a first round of review, the Program Committee and the chairs will select a number of submissions confirming to the challenge requirements that will be invited to present their work. Submissions accepted for presentation will be included in post-proceedings and will receive constructive reviews from the Program Committee. All accepted submissions will have a slot in a poster session dedicated to the challenge. In addition, the winners will present their work in a special slot of the main program of ESWC and will be invited to submit a paper to a dedicated Semantic Web Journal special issue.

For the Concept-Level Sentiment Analysis Challenge there will be two awards for each task:
* Quantitative: the system with the highest average score in items 1-3 above;
* Innovative: the system with the highest score in item 4 above.

There will be a board of judges at the conference who will evaluate again the systems in more detail. The judges will then meet in private to discuss the entries and to determine the winners. It may happen that the same system runs for both the awards. Winners will be selected only for tasks with at least 3 participants. In any case all submissions will be reviewed and, if accepted, published in ESWC post-proceedings. An amount of 700 euros has already been secured for the first task for what the first point of the evaluation aspects is concerned. We are currently working on securing further funding.


HOW TO PARTICIPATE

The following information has to be provided:
* Abstract: no more than 200 words.
* Description: It should contain the details of the system, including why the system is innovative, how it uses Semantic Web, which features or functions the system provides, what design choices were made and what lessons were learned.

Dear all,

Science and payments were on the mind.

I was specifically mentioning the web payments work that has been occuring
on the W3C site. It appears that both Dave Raggett (1) and Manu Sporny (2)
have led initiatives. Manu Sporny, CEO of Digital Bazaar and proponent of a
web payments standard, wrote a post (3,4) about Web Payments with Open
Access journals. In this post, he does mention paying a small fee to read
journal articles. I suppose this could include
PDFs.

I very much enjoyed the article that Ullrich linked to. It speaks of three
tools to enable research: crowd funding, social payments, and virtual
currencies. From the article, crowd funding and social payments seem to be
different in that crowd funding allocates resources to something that has
yet to exist and social payments allocates resources to something that
already exists.

The article also brings up some interesting points. It states that,
"research as a process is lengthy, institutionally anchored, and
team-based." and that, "The results of the research process in many
disciplines are not immediately 'tangible' -- rather they are documented in
articles, books, or conference presentations, and more rarely in patents
and new products." with the conclusion that, "Presumably, crowdfunding for
science and research will have to rely on entirely different types of
information.", as opposed to a Kickstarter project. Three elements were
suggested for a crowdfunding platform were "(a) visualization of knowledge
gaps, (b) results achieved by funds, and (c) participation options for
supporters".

Flattr was described as an example for the socialy payments tool. It allows
for small payments to be sent to content creators through the push of a
button.

I have wondered how value networks (5) might be integrated into open
research, with the use of of web payments. I've thought that money could
flow through value networks using something like the MNDF project (6) I
considered earlier, which seems to resemble social payments but considers
dependencies as well. While complex, would it be possible to have external
and internal value networks interacting together producing some sort of
open source ecosystem? The Sensorica project (6) is looking into open value
networks (7).

Hello OKFN Science Group.

Cross posted on: OKFN - Open science, OKFN - Dennark, Labitat discuss
list, Biologigaragen
board & Group, sorry for double posts.

I am a local member of okfn Denmark  (Copenhagen)

My name is Martin Malthe Borch
I am currently chairman of the copenhagen hackerspace Labitat.dk & the
diybio/citizen science group Biologigaragen.org
I'm a researcher at ITU.dk & I have a master in bIological engineering from
DTU.dk  and a master in Interaction design from ciid.dk.

In relation to OKFN-science I'm part of, or running the following projects:

* We are in Biologigaragen setting up an open science / citizen science
festival during "ESOF.org - science in the city" called Kopenlab.dk
(website under development). Here we would love to showcase hacker, maker
and citizen science projects that somehow relate to knowledge sharing, to
the general public and the estimated 3500 professionals attending the
festival. Let us know if you'd like to show your, hack or your project.
It's the 21-26 of June. We hope to bring people together a few days before
to plan, setup and have fun. More info will come later.

* I have been part of setting up Biostrike - a citizen science project to
identify new antibiotics

Onepager:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LjZCaKrbu-dARUsQSFd522tgcuBanYjdTwPT9mQpaAY/edit

* We are also trying to establish a Citizen Science Center in Copenhagen
where researchers, student & Ph.ds from the various university research
groups and institutets can meet and collaborate with industry and get
valuable data and feedback from hackers and the public.

* One example is the open collaboration between Novozymes and
biologigaragen, trying to develop open source assay tools:
http://biologigaragen.org/baessy/ for both industrial R&D & hacker groups.

* In biologigaragen we also organize workshops to give the general public
hands-on experience with biological science: http://biologigaragen.org/gen/

* I am a cofounder of diybio.eu, and we are part of the global diybio /
biohacker community

* We would love to create a local open science group here in Copenhagen in
connection to Biologigaragen & Labitat.

We are looking forward to join your discussions here and collaborate on
open science & Citizen Science projects.

I / we are looking forward to meet you all.

Andrew,

I agree with you. In addition, webpayments for documents on the web make me
feel uncomfortable too. This is not the position I am taking. Rather I feel
that webpayments should be used for other products or interactions that
companies traditionally sell. This is rather an ambiguous statement. The
presentation (1) that John Wilbanks gave at Oxford in 2007 illuminates
this. He goes into explaining that movement to a commons model could help
incremental innovation in pharmaceutical innovation, but that it might not
work everywhere. For example he says that, "the commons does not work very
well if the materials are very expensive and intentionally acquired". This
distinction is very confusing for me. I do not know if I can understand it.

What I am proposing is the open value network approach (2). By doing this,
interactions may be visualized as graphs as in chapter 2 of Verna Allee's
book (3) and hopefully all data may be represented as linked data (4). In
this way I hope that value streams (5) may be visualized that do not harm
others. I believe with these valuestreams an envisioned universal
webpayments standard, such as Payswarm, might be appropriate.

I must admit that I have not given much thought to crowdfunding vs. social
payments. I would guess that using value streams would be closer to using
social payments. Thanks for your questions. I hope that what I have written
makes sense.

Thanks,

Brent

First of all thanks for posting, Angela and I hope you have settled well
into you initial studies and research. I hope someone has an answer for you
but don't be surprised if not.

Finding data in any area is not easy. That's a major reason why CKAN was
started. Some disciplines (space, meteorology, some health) publish data
sets as such but most scientists either publish datasets along with a paper
or, more commonly, don't publish them at all.

I think in OKFN we should tackle this in the following ways (cf Panton
Principles):

* encourage the posting of data (probably most usefully alongside papers)
* help to create metadata so the datasets can be discovered
* push journals, libraries etc. to take this seriously (very few do)

and build search engines.

What we need is a search engine for science. Google etc. don't do that as
they don't generally understand the domains. The data should probably be
transformed into a semantic form (e.g. Jim Hendler created/discovered a
miilion+ semantic datasets in RDF).

But there's an awful lot of data out there already , which is why I am
pushing content-mining.

And the major problem is that vested interests (e.g. academic publishers,
reference works) don't want this data discovered and published because
their business models are based on reselling the information that we have
created and is already out there.

Subject: [open-science] Building an Open Science Q&A site
Message-ID: <530761A1.9000901@icm.edu.pl>

Dear list,

*Background*.  Some of you may know StackExchange.com, a popular network 
of community-driven Q&A sites (5 million users, 8 million questions, 15 
million answers).  The individual sites focus on different topics, such 
as: programming, mathematics, English language, computer games, 
photography, science fiction, religions, etc.  Each Q&A site has a 
well-designed, inviting interface through which users may ask questions, 
provide answers, upvote and downvote both Qs and As.  Lots of badges 
stimulate users for better contributions and more intensive activity.

For example, StackOverflow.com (Q&A site for programmers) has become 
both a large compendium of knowledge about programming (structured in 
the form of Q&As), and a popular social site for answering questions. 
Many (most?) of my programming-related Google searches lead me to 
answers on StackOverflow.

Last but not least, the network has worked out a mature set of policies 
and mechanisms for community-driven development of new sites.


*Call for action*.  I have just created a proposal for a new Q&A site in 
the StackExchange network, devoted to Open Science:

   http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/65426/open-science

and I would like to encourage you to participate in its development. 
Please follow the link above, and sign up or log in using your 
Google/Facebook credentials.  Next, "follow" the proposal, vote on the 
questions (upvote the questions you consider on-topic, downvote the 
off-topic ones, discuss) and propose your own questions.


*Technicalities*.  In the first phase (called "Definition") we need to 
gather 60 people interested in creating the site.  We also need to write 
and select a total of 40 on-topic and off-topic questions (examples of 
both types are needed).  This way we will define what the site will and 
will not be about, and we will move to the next phases (Commitment, then 
Private Beta, then Public Beta).  Ultimately, we will all be 
collaboratively building a knowledge base on Open Science and providing 
support for the general public.


*Why*?  To create a one stop shop for all the people having questions 
about Open Science.  I have seen a great deal of energy and enthusiasm 
in the Open Science community, and a lot of interest in the Open Science 
issues among researchers and other stakeholders.  This is an attempt to 
channel the energy of the community and to leverage a popular platform 
in order to advance the cause.


I'm confident that we will create a useful and vibrant site!

Best regards,

Lukasz

Hi Lukasz,

I'm not against this idea, and have long thought StackExchange could be a
powerful way to work together (not least because of the remarkable metrics
it employs to track contributions) but I think a couple of things ought to
be established first:

1) How would this be superior from what is quite a useful Google+ community
on open science, where obviously inputs are quite discoverable. On the one
hand there are no metrics applied to participants, but on the other hand
it's quite active and would be suitable for many of the sorts of
discussions suggested on the trial page you have up.

2) "Open Science" has become a very broad term. To many it refers to issues
around open access, or open data. To me it means (mostly) a different kind
of collaborative process that arises from open access and open data.
Diversity of opinions is good, but you should probably be prepared for the
Q&A site to become dominated by one of those flavours of "open science"
unless you are specific about coverage right from the start.

To my mind one of the strengths of StackExchange (for e.g. code) is that
people are asking how to do things, and other people share solutions for
how to do those things. So some of the sample questions you have up there
are of this type (How do I get a DOI for a dataset) whereas others are the
kinds of questions that just need a bit of Googling around or where the
solutions may be better served by a wiki article (e.g. what's the
difference between Green and Gold OA). Perhaps it would be useful if there
were a tight relationship between a Q&A site, for the frontier how-to
questions, and the Wikipedia page on open science where established
information would be better placed, or where a discussion with a clear
answer could trigger someone to install the answer on the Wikipedia page.

So I'm not saying don't do this, but I for one would love for the focus to
be more "How do I do [technical thing in my open project]" rather than
"What do people think about [broad philosophical issue]". The former would
create something different and valuable.

Cheers,

Mat

It  is very tricky to start a StackExchange site, when there already SE sites with some overlap (speaking as some-one who tried it an failed - http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/130361/why-did-theoretical-physics-fail).

But the good thing is that they are already SE sites related to open science:
http://academia.stackexchange.com/ (actually, there are already many open science questions there)
and
http://opendata.stackexchange.com/

I would suggest asking questions open science questions on the above sites.

As I see from the OpenScience.SE proposal, all suggested questions either fit in at least one of the above, or in general are not good SE-questions (too subjective or open-ended).

Also note, that OpenData.SE is somewhere on the verge of (not) having critical mass of users, so splitting the topic even further is unlikely to be successful. 

Regards,
Piotr

Perhaps it would be useful if there were a tight relationship between a Q&A site, for the frontier how-to questions, and the Wikipedia page on open science where established information would be better placed, or where a discussion with a clear answer could trigger someone to install the answer on the Wikipedia page.

StackExchange comes with its proprietary bits... please consider open
solutions too, e.g. the BioStar Central platform:

Dear Piotr, Matthew,

thanks for your comments.  Let me briefly address here the points you 
have raised, a bit longer version can be found there:

   http://discuss.area51.stackexchange.com/a/13484/16092

First of all, thank you, Piotr, for a pointer to the "Why did 
Theoretical Physics fail?" discussion.  It is very insightful!  Let me 
point one difference between Theoretical Physics and the proposed Open 
Science that gives the latter some hope: OS is a "hot topic", with 
increasing demand for information from the general public, especially in 
the light of changing policies of funding agencies, governments, 
libraries and publishers.  TP, on the other hand, registers rather 
stable interest.

Mat, regarding #1, I greatly appreciate all the fantastic initiatives 
like the Google+ community and the hard work that is associated with it. 
  I do believe, however, that there is still room for a Q&A site (be it 
OpenScience.SE or Academia.SE), as this particular format of presenting 
information is 1) very friendly to search engines and 2) encourages 
participation/involvement of casual visitors.

Regarding Mat's #2, let me start with a disclaimer: it is up to the 
community, not to me, to define the scope of the new site.  My personal 
opinion follows.  I believe that, ultimately, OpenScience.SE will get a 
lot (majority) of traffic from search engines like Google, and that a 
Q&A site is even more suited to store the general knowledge (e.g. 
"What's the difference between Green OA and Gold OA?") than a *regular* 
wiki (after all, SE has the "community wiki" feature, which should be 
used for a collaborative answer to the above question).

I, too, would like to avoid open-ended questions like "What do people 
think about [broad philosophical issue]".  I, too, prefer the "How do I 
do [technical thing in my open project]" type.  I hope this kind of 
scope will prevail.

Best regards,

Lukasz

Dear Egon,

Although the software engine powering StackExchange is not open source, 
data dumps of their sites are freely available and licensed under 
CC-BY-SA 3.0:

   http://data.stackexchange.com/help

So we are not risking any lock-in, we will retain the freedom to migrate 
somewhere else if we choose so.  For me that is enough to feel comfortable.

Best,
Lukasz

Dear ?ukasz,

I don't object that open science is a hot topic.
(Though, OpenData is far from having a sustainable activity of users, at least as of now.)

And for SE site the practice shows, that creating new site works only in two cases:
- there is totally no SE site where you can ask the questions,
- there is already very strong community on an existing SE site, willing to split.

Just the practice shows, that if there is a single site where you can ask question - just do so!
(Also beware: setting a new site takes months - a year, given everything goes well.)

Furthermore, more overlap is coming soon:
- http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/58715/open-source-licensing

So just try asking two or three questions on
http://academia.stackexchange.com/
and see how it goes!
I would be happy to see you in the Academia.SE community!

Regards,
Piotr

Let me point one difference between Theoretical Physics and the proposed Open Science that gives the latter some hope: OS is a "hot topic", with increasing demand for information from the general public, especially in the light of changing policies of funding agencies, governments, libraries and publishers.

I believe that, ultimately, OpenScience.SE will get a lot (majority) of traffic from search engines like Google, and that a Q&A site is even more suited to store the general knowledge (e.g. "What's the difference between Green OA and Gold OA?") than a *regular* wiki (after all, SE has the "community wiki" feature, which should be used for a collaborative answer to the above question).

As a longtime SE user, I'm very glad to see this discussion here.
I think openscience.SE is a worthy idea, but I completely agree with the
concerns being raised by Piotr. It takes a large committed community to
build an active SE site.

I have another concern I'd like to raise, and a suggestion.
SE's policy for accepting only questions with defined answers is helpful,
but is it applicable for the topic of Open Science? I think that many
questions about open science deserve vigorous discussion, and don't have
clear answers.

One of StackExchange's founders Jeff Atwood started a new discussion forum
software called
Discourse<https://app.getsignals.com/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.discourse.org%2F&ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAgIDmnK4KDA&k=dc2408c5-674d-4930-a176-630e1f89dc9b>that
is a major improvement over other forum softwares. Here is an
example<https://app.getsignals.com/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdiscuss.howtogeek.com%2F&ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAgIDmnK4KDA&k=cd2f1e8f-01cd-43a8-a7fb-66edfe03a51f>of
a Discourse forum. I think Discourse is a big improvement over
listservs
and even a SE site (which is better suited to topics that have a large
community already). Discourse is open source, and must be self-hosted (not
so difficult). I hope you'll check it out.

Cheers
Ted Strauss

Yeah, Discourse is pretty interesting, including for smaller groups or
whipping up conversation which isn't happening yet, I'm looking into it for
a project of mine around Postgrad funding.

If people feel that a Discourse forum would be a good idea instead of a SE
site I can probably host and maintain it on our servers at a production
level (so as close to 24/7 as possible, keep the performance nice, minimise
hiccups, get domain).

As for applicability of a SE site, I think that a lot of people have a lot
of questions about Open Science (incl. what it is, exactly). These are
repeated by pretty much everybody new to the idea. SE is a Q&A site, so
people naturally try to match the two (but as pointed out in the prolific
discussion in this thread, SE may not be the best fit).

Of course wikis have existed for ages and fulfilled the same need - except
they're not good for discussions. They're also kinda hard to market for
some reason as of yet unknown to me (it's just difficult to get people to
engage with them, esp. contribute). Talking about custom ones of course,
not Wikipedia.

I'm not quite convinced that Discourse will serve our needs better, but at
the end of the day I would actually like to have a place where researchers
can ask questions about Open Science, so I'll just start on it if nothing
better (by consensus) comes up in the conversation.

Greetings,
Emanuil

for a subject like open science.

There is a meta-Discourse forum for users of the forum software itself.
I posted a topic<https://app.getsignals.com/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmeta.discourse.org%2Ft%2Fmultiple-languages-on-single-discourse-site%2F8269%2F4&ukey=agxzfnNpZ25hbHNjcnhyGAsSC1VzZXJQcm9maWxlGICAgIDmnK4KDA&k=43e692f5-0b9e-4064-b757-93e5e13ae736>
8
months ago asking about multi-language features.
There was an initial burst of interest, and then the topic was dormant.
Every time a new comment was added, all previous contributors
got an email notification about it (these notifications can be turned off),
which led to another burst of comments.

Then, after about 7 months, a group of programmers stepped up and
volunteered to implement the suggested features for the software, and are
now contributing to the github repository. It took 7 months before real
action took place, but the way Discourse archives topics keeps the
conversation relevant, and keeps the previous contributors up to date with
new developments. There is also a weekly (or daily) digest email about the
most active topics.

I think this is an excellent model for open science topics, and a big
improvement over listservs, q&a sites, and wikis, all of which have
important niches to fill. Listservs are best for timely announcements;
wikis are best when ideas are settled and no longer being debated;
q&a is good when clear unambiguous answers are the priority.
Discourse is great for extended conversations that can bifurcate
in unpredictable directions.

Emanuil, if you are willing to set up a installation of Discourse, perhaps
we could try out a test with a few participants?

Cheers
Ted
