Hi all,

I have not looked at Is It Open Data? recently... honestly, the lack
of response we get is depressing...

In a discussion last week it came up that "we" need to look at it...
there is apparently some SPAM, and the latest message is of
questionable quality...

When is the next open science wg meeting?

Egon

Yes. But not surprising.

We don't win everything first time. I reckon I have launched about 10
significant tools on the Internet over the last 20 years and about 30% have
taken off. I think that's what we can expect. Some need funding.

I suspect that IIOD was launched in advance of its time. Its time is
coming. We may need to reconfigure.

It's the sort of thing that is now very relevant to funders' requirements
for ensuring that their funded projects create Open Data. I and others are
talking with funders about how OKF tools can be relevant to their
needs.based

I was inspired by the success of MySociety in creating various information
tools such as WhatDoTheyKnow (FOI) and WriteToThem MPs) and suggested IIOD.
I am grateful to those who put in the work - it was significant. But WDTK
and WTT have major advantages:
* responses are required by law
* MS are funded
* they are approved by government.

None of this applies at present to IIOD. But it may. Substitute
"government" by "researchFunder" and it starts to look very valuable and
feasible. I think the next stage may be to get Funder sponsorship

Hi All

The IIOD? site has been retired and archived during a recent OKFN website
clear up (see Rufus' email below). I haven't tried to make a query but I'm
assuming you no longer can. I agree with Peter that the project definitely
still has scope and with some care, attention and publicity  (and possibly
funding) could rise again and have been meaning to contact the list about
this so thanks for taking the initiative Egon!


   We can definitely discuss at the next working group meeting, which I'll
   set for after OKFest and maybe get some people looking at it during the
   October working group hackday.


   Meanwhile, if everyone could make their thoughts known on this that
   would be great - do you think the site is useful in its current form? What
   changes would you like to see? Would you be willing to help move it forward?

For those who have not come across Is It Open Data, the site is still live
in read-only mode so check it out. http://www.isitopendata.org/

   http://getthedata.org/, http://ideas.okfn.org, http://isitopendata.org/
   To: okfn-discuss <okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org>


   Hi All,

   I just wanted to let people know that we have retired (and archived) a
   few sites:

   http://getthedata.org/
   http://ideas.okfn.org
   http://isitopendata.org/

   Note that all sites will be preserved online in read-only mode so no
   content has been lost.

   In all cases the immediate reason is that we are re-organizing and
   rationalizing our sysadmin setup as we move hosting provider and
   archiving these sites allowed us to decommission the underlying web
   application. The more general reasons are:

   GetTheData: interesting experiment, initially quite active but lately
   much less so and increasing spam issues plus the underlying software
   no longer seems actively maintained (OSQA). Going forward we want this
   either to StackOverflow or integrate with something like School of
   Data or DataHub

   ideas.okfn.org: the underlying software (OSQA) no longer actively
   maintained. ideas.okfn.org has been very useful but we think we can
   support similarly functionality using other services going forward.

   isitopendata.org: IsItOpenData has served its purpose incredibly well
   and is now relatively little used. It is reasonably complex bespoke
   web-app so retiring it means we have one less moving part to maintain.
   In addition, should the functionality provided turn out to be widely
   missed we could resurrect it as part of other sites (notably the
   DataHub)

   Lastly, please note that we are migrating our Wordpress "farm" which
   runs many of our sites (okfn.org/ and *.okfn.org among others) this
   Wednesday so there may be some brief downtime [1].

   Regards,

   Rufus

Hi All

The next working group meeting will be an opportunity to reflect on OKFest,
discuss the fate of Is It Open Data?, get up to date on some of the latest
citizen science/DIY BIO activity in Europe as well as voicing your opinions
on projects we should be getting involved in or initiating.

Got an idea for an open science project that you need help with? Bring it
to the group and we'll do our best to assist and put you in touch with
relevant people around the OKF network.

When: Wednesday 26 September at 17:30 UTC/GMT (18:30 UK time)
Location: Etherpad http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-26Sep2012 and Skype (add
your Skype ID to the Etherpad and I'll bring you into the conference call)

Please add your name and Skype ID to the list of attendees on
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-26Sep2012
Add anything you'd like to be discussed or new ideas to the agenda (even if
you can't make it yourself, just make sure you add enough details).

Hope to speak to some of you there!

Jenny

The latest post (a really bad one) and the top query if you 'browse'
is of less than two months ago...

I do not think I'd suggest to resurrect it... we tried it, but from
the input I got, it did more bad than good... I liked the idea, but it
just did not work out. CKAN is probably better, allowing us to add
license info (or lack thereof) to data sets, summarize that and send
out reports that USA governmental organization releases 75% as
non-public domain, despite.... (or whatever...) Less personal,
statistically more relevant, and not asking individuals to overrule
their organizational history...

Dear folks,

I've been working in the reproducible research movement for quite a few years, building systems and legal standards to encourage scientists to openly release the data and code that underlies published results. I'm a founder of http://www.RunMyCode.org , which is designed to do just that.

We're looking for developers to join us in building out the site, creating "companion pages" for published research, and engaging in outreach to the scientific community. Our job announcement is here: http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/HiringRMC.html and follows this email below.

I would really appreciate your help in getting the word out. Please forward widely and if you know anyone who might be interested (including yourself!) just let me know - jobs at stodden.net

many thanks,

Hi all,

Just a final post to warn you that tickets for OKFest are beginning to sell
out! If you haven't yet bought yours, get it here:
http://okfestival.org/early-bird-okfest-tickets/

We have an exciting series of sessions lined up for Open Science and Open
Access, and it would be great to see an equally strong representation of
scientists in the audience.

Highlights include:
** Mat Todd* from the University of Sydney talking about Open Source Drug
Discovery; *
* Carl-Christian Buhr *from the Cabinet of Neelie Kroes leading a workshop
on the Commission's new open access policy;
* Sessions on *Crowdsourcing Data*, *Communicating Science*, *Open Access
in Practice*, *Immediate Access to Raw Data from Experiments* and more,
with a great line up of speakers from the World Bank, Ushahidi, Wikimedia,
FigShare and beyond.

More details on the Science sessions:
http://okfestival.org/open-research-and-education/
And on the wider programme:
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/09/05/okfest-2week-bulletin/

If you can't make the main event, there is also a **FREE** science hackday
in Helsinki on Tuesday 18th. Sign-up here:
http://okfestival.org/open-culture-and-science-hackday/

There are fewer than 100 tickets remaining, so please do share this with
friends, colleagues and around any mailing lists you may be part of. It
would be great to get some more scientists together in the final fortnight!

Kind regards,
Laura

There is a very nice new post by Joss Winn of the Orbital project at
Lincoln University on using CKAN for research data management:

http://orbital.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2012/09/06/choosing-ckan-for-research-data-management/

To steal Joss's thunder slightly, he concludes "It seems odd to me
that [CKAN] has such a low profile in academia and I do think that the
time has come to embrace CKAN and acknowledge the efforts of OKFN more
widely."

Orbital recently decided to adopt CKAN as the basis for their RDM
platform. More background at

I would be Very happy to give a demo at the Oxford Digital Research meeting
next week if there are some publicly available data. We have a slot which
has been compressed in time but we are planning to do something with Open
Biblio and this would be a very nice addendum.

Is there any data in the system at present ?

Dear Open Science and OKFN folks,

I will be attending my first OK Festival in a few days. I am hoping to meet as many of you as possible and have one-on-one meetings to talk about how we can work together toward our common goal of making science data accessible and usable by everyone with little or no impedance. 

If you are going to be in Helsinki, and are interested in a chat, long or short, with or without an espresso, please, I would love to hear from you.

Hi Puneet,

Your email is well-timed, because I am just arranging details of an Open
Science themed dinner to be held as part of OKFest!

This will take place on the evening of Wednesday 19th September,
immediately following Mat Todd's keynote speech.

Basically, it will be an opportunity for anyone who is interested in open
science and open access to socialise together in a relaxed and informal
setting. Everyone is warmly invited to attend!

It would be great to see both yourself and others there. More details and a
sign-up link at: http://science.okfnpad.org/okfest-dinner

All the best,
Laura

Thanks Laura, signed up. Look forward to seeing a bunch of folks there. 

I do also want to meet up with folks one-on-one. My intent is to start a long-term conversation about how OKFN and Creative Commons can work *together* toward our common goals. Meeting folks personally is my main intent on this visit.

Hi Puneet,

Great to know that you would be there at OKFest... Just now I spoke with K.
Srikanth, Bangalore who would also be present at OKFest (he would join from
Berlin)...

I am following u since a long time... now I would get an opportunity to
meet and discuss on common issues... with reference to India - Open
Knowledge and sharing of Materials (seeds in Open Access mode)....

Waiting for the 16th Sept....

Thanks

Sridhar

Guys,
I'm at a tropical medicine conference (
http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/jdiio3) in London right before
coming to Helsinki, and will try to get some information on what the call
is really about. The malaria component is very focussed, and the NTD one
too has nuances that make me wonder if they're looking for something quite
specific.
Cheers,
Mat

Subject: [open-science] White paper on implementing CC0 for data in
	peer-reviewed journals
Message-ID: <0DBF2BD4A4CE9B45B8A90A65CD8338EA062F85DF@SEGBLOGR0008.springer-sbm.com>

Dear all,

 

Matt Cockerill and I at BioMed Central have published in BMC Research
Notes a detailed proposal for implementing Creative Commons CC0 for data
published in peer-reviewed journals and are seeking responses to a
number of proposals in the paper. The proposals include implementing
Open Bibliography.

 

Paper:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/494/abstract

 

And a summary including the key questions we are soliciting responses to
is on the BMC Blog:

http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2012/09/10/put-the-open-in-open-d
ata/ 

 

Any help in soliciting responses - and responses - from this group would
be greatly appreciated. I'm particularly keen to hear from the
"unconverted".

 

Questions we seek the scientific community's input on:
- How appropriate is public domain dedication for data you (already)
publish in journals?
- How do you define data - what data file types do you commonly publish
as additional files (supplementary material)?
- How might removing legal restrictions on data sharing benefit (or
harm) your research?

 

This follows our Publishing Open Data Working Group meeting in June 2011
(attended by a number of this group)
http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bmcblog/2011/08/08/report-from-the-publis
hing-open-data-working-group-meeting-17th-june-2011/

 

and draft Open Data Statement in September 2010
http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/join_the_data_deb
ate_draft 

 

Feel free to contact me directly with any questions.

 

Best regards,

 

Iain

An Open Call: I have a brain cancer.

"A brain cancer. Some very personal Open Data. An opportunity."

http://www.artisopensource.net/cure/

Salvatore Iocanesi, has put out an open call for all to grab the information
about his disease, and create a video, an artwork, a map, a text, a poem, a
game, or try to find a solution for his health problem.

Info:

Yesterday I went to get my digital medical records: I have to show them to
many doctors.

Sadly they were in a closed, proprietary format and, thus, I could not open
them using my computer, or send them in this format to all the people who
could have saved my life.

I cracked them.

I opened them and converted the contents into open formats, so that I could
share them with everyone.

Just today I have been able to share the data about my health condition
(about my brain cancer) with 3 doctors.

2 of them already replied.

I have been able to do it because the data used open, accessible
formats: they have been able to open the files using their computers, their
tablets. They have been able to reply from home, on sunday.

I will progressively publish all the replies I will receive, using open
formats, so that anyone with my same disease will be able to benefit from
the solutions I will find.

This is a CURE. This is my OPEN SOURCE CURE.

This is an open invitation to take part in the CURE.

CURE, in different cultures, means different things.

There are cures for the body, for spirit, for communication.

Grab the information about my disease, if you want, and give me a CURE:
create a video, an artwork, a map, a text, a poem, a game, or try to find a
solution for my health problem.

Artists, designers, hackers, scientists, doctors, photographers,
videomakers, musicians, writers. Anyone can give me a CURE.

Create your CURE using the content which you find in the DATI/DATA section
here on this site, and send it to info at artisopensource.net.

All CURES will be displayed here.

This is tremendous. (I'm not dreaming?) They have reasserted the centrality
of BOAI. This is exactly what is required - everything else follows. This
is the only effective definition of OA libre.

And I have spent a whole day having to challenge Stevan Harnad at the
Digital Research 2012 meeting (and, immodestly) I think the proper BOAI
approach prevailed.

Maybe the OKF should create something that helps reinforce the BOAI
declaration.

BTW I am continuing to pickup vibes that Panton, Open Biblio principles and
Open Content Manifesto are gathering interest. Perhaps we should package
these with OKD and promote the universality of the philosophy. Sophie K has
made Panton postcards and maybe we could create siblilngs where we list the
various definitions

10th ESWC 2013 -- Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013, Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/

General Chair:
Philipp Cimiano (Bielefeld University, DE)

Program Chairs
Valentina Presutti (STLab, ISTC-CNR, IT)
Oscar Corcho (UPM, ES)

==== *Call for Papers* ====

ESWC is the premier European-based annual conference for researchers and practitioners in the field of semantic technologies. ESWC is the ideal venue for the discussion of the latest scientific insights and novel applications of semantic technologies.

The leading motto of the 10th edition of ESWC will be "Semantics and Big Data". A crucial challenge that will guide the efforts of many scientific communities in the years to come is the one of making sense of large volumes of heterogeneous and complex data. Application-relevant data often has to be processed in real time and originates from diverse sources such as Linked Data, text and speech, images, videos and sensors, communities and social networks, etc. ESWC, with its focus on semantics, can offer an important contribution to global challenge.

ESWC 2013 will feature nine thematic research tracks (see below) as well as an in-use and industrial track. In line with the motto "Semantics and Big Data", the conference will feature a special track on "Semantic Technologies for Big Data Analytics in Real Time". In order to foster the interaction with other disciplines, this year's edition will also feature a special track on "Cognition and Semantic Web".

For the research and special tracks, we welcome the submission of papers describing theoretical, analytical, methodological, empirical, and application research on semantic technologies. For the In-Use and Industrial track we solicit the submission of papers describing the practical exploitation of semantic technologies in different domains and sectors. Submitted papers should describe original work, present significant results, and provide rigorous, principled, and repeatable evaluation. We strongly encourage and appreciate the submission of papers including links to data sets and other material used for the evaluation as well as to live demos or source code for tool implementations.

Submitted papers will be judged based on originality, awareness of related work, potential impact on the Semantic Web field, technical soundness of the proposed methods, and readability. Each paper will be reviewed by at least three program committee members in addition to one track chair. This year a rebuttal phase has been introduced in order to give authors the opportunity to provide feedback to reviewers' questions. The authors' answers will support reviewers and track chairs in their discussion and in taking final decisions regarding acceptance.

Anyone fancy informally doing an Open Science Sauna?

I'm intrigued by the http://www.opensauna.org/ idea, but don't quite get
how it works.
Perhaps we could all just arrange to meet at a particular sauna and time
ourselves?

I believe most Finnish saunas are strictly separate sexes(???), so we might
need to make sure we have enough of each gender (hence I'm specifically
pinging Laura, Jenny and Sophie [hi!], my girlfriend Avril is very much up
for sauna-ing too).

Is anyone interested in that idea?

Best,  (and very much looking forward to Helsinki!)

Ross

PS for music fans, I've earmarked Thursday night for an indie gig at one of
Helsinki's most famous venues, Tavastia:

10th ESWC 2013 -- Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013. Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/

==== Call for Tutorials ====

ESWC 2013 invites tutorials that address the interests of its varied audience: people new to the Semantic Web, Semantic Web researchers and practitioners that wish to learn new technologies, users of Semantic Web technologies, and representatives of government and funding agencies as well as potential private investors in Semantic Web technologies. We welcome submissions of tutorial proposals on all major topics related to semantic technologies.

We especially solicit proposals for tutorials of the following types:

- Tutorials with a coherent theme providing an introduction to new semantic technologies and trends.
- Tutorials describing the application of semantic technologies in specific domains (e.g., life-sciences, e-government, e-commerce etc.).
- Tutorials presenting techniques from other research fields that are of relevance for Semantic Web research especially in relationship to the tracks of the conference (e.g., techniques from social science, database techniques, NLP techniques etc.).

Tutorials can be half a day or a full day.

We advise having more than one presenter and no more than three, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.

Tutorials may focus entirely on theoretical aspects; however, we encourage organisers to incorporate hands-on sessions where appropriate. The tutorials should reach a good balance between the topic coverage and its relevance to the community.	

Timeline for Tutorials
----------------------
Proposals due: Nov 23, 2012 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Notification of acceptance: Dec 7, 2012 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial Web site due: Dec 17, 2012 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Camera-ready material due: Apr 29, 2013 - 23:59 Hawaii Time
Tutorial days: May 26 and May 27, 2013

Responsibilities
----------------
Organizers of accepted tutorials are responsible for preparing and maintaining a Web site that describes the tutorial and includes all relevant information. Organizers are also responsible for submitting the material to be given to attendees (slide sets, additional teaching material, software installation and usage guides for practical hands-on sessions, etc.) to the Tutorial Chair. The ESWC 2013 Organizing Committee is responsible for providing publicity for the tutorials as part of the conference publicity activities, and on-site logistical support to the organizers and attendees.

General Information
-------------------
Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for workshop and tutorials, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fees. Further, each workshop or tutorial that attracts more than 15 registered participants (excluding the organizers) will get one full registration for the conference. This registration can be used for example to pay for an invited speaker.

Submission details
------------------
Tutorial proposals should not exceed 5 pages, using an 11 pt font for the body of the text of the proposal and should contain the following information:

- Abstract (200 words maximum, for inclusion on the ESWC 2013 website).
         
- Tutorial description: More specifically, it should specify the objectives of the tutorial and relevance to ESWC 2013, include enough details on the scope of the material to be covered and the depth to which it will be covered and specify the intended audience and any prerequisite knowledge. Appropriate references to the material to be covered by the tutorial must be included.

- Tutorial length. The tutorial can be full or half day (if the tutorial can be either length, please be sure to identify which material is included for each length).
         
- Specify other venues to which the tutorial or part thereof has or will be presented, in addition to explaining how the current tutorial differs from the other editions. Links to the slides of those tutorial editions should be included in the proposal.
         
- Brief professional biography of the presenter(s) indicating previous training and speaking experience (such as teaching and tutorial presentation).

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the tutorial programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the tutorial's fit to the conference. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal.

Submission

10th ESWC 2013 -- Semantics and Big Data
May 26-30, 2013. Montpellier, France.
http://2013.eswc-conferences.org/

==== Call for Workshops ====

The organizers the 10th ESWC cordially invite you to submit a workshop proposal. ESWC is a major venue for discussing the latest scientific results and innovations in the field of Semantic Web technologies.

Co-located workshops at ESWC conferences are distinguished meeting points for discussing ongoing work and latest ideas related to semantics and the Semantic Web. Of particular interest are workshop proposals with an interdisciplinary standpoint, proposals focusing on a specific technology of general interest, or gathering a sub-community. We encourage the submission of workshop proposals on:

- Fundamental problems of the semantic web such as heterogeneity, scalability and distribution,
- Applications of Semantic Web technologies in specific domains,
- Important enabling technologies and their adaptation to the needs of the Semantic Web, and
- Aspects of Semantic Web research that have been neglected so far.

*** General Information and Criteria ***

Each proposal will be reviewed by the members of the workshop programme committee, and ranked based on the overall quality of the proposal and the workshop's fit to the conference as detailed below. Their recommendation will determine the final decision on the acceptance/rejection of each proposal, which is to be taken by the workshop and tutorial chairs as well as by the local and the general chair of ESWC 2013.

The criteria for judging the quality of workshop proposals are as follows:

- Co-located workshops cover topics falling in the general scope of the ESWC conference (refer to http://www.eswc-conferences.org).
- Workshops are intended to be genuine interactive events and not mini-conferences.
- We welcome workshops with creative structures and organizations that attract various types of contributions and ensure rich interactions.
- They are clearly focused.
- There is potentially a significant community interested in the workshop's topic.
- Workshop duration can be half a day or a full day.
- We advise having more than one organizer and no more than four, preferably from different institutions, bringing different perspectives to the workshop topic.

In case overlapping workshops are proposed, the workshop chair may contact the organisers to discuss the possibility of merging workshops. Please note that the duration of a workshop might need to be adjusted based on the overall number of submissions received. Further, workshops that receive less than 5 submissions or have less than 10 people registered at the early registration deadline might be canceled.

The organizers of accepted workshops will be responsible for their own reviewing process, publicity (e.g., website and call for papers), and proceedings production. They will be required to closely cooperate with the Workshop Chair and the ESWC 2013 local organizers to finalize all organizational details. Workshop attendees must pay the ESWC 2013 workshop registration fee, as well as the conference registration fee.

Organizers of workshops and tutorials will get a free registration for workshop and tutorials, i.e. they will only have to pay the main conference fees.
Further, each workshop or tutorial that attracts more than 15 registered participants (excluding the organizers) will get one full registration for the conference. This registration can be used for example to pay for an invited speaker.

*** Submission Guidelines ***

Workshop proposals have to be submitted via Easychair (https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eswc2013workshops). Each proposal must consist of a single PDF document, not longer than 3 pages, which contains the following information:

1. The title and brief technical description of the workshop, specifying its goals and motivation.
2. A brief discussion of why the topic is of particular interest at this time.

Message-ID: <CADOXZMy5jtRoH0AYoGz7=pvsn+2Zr7PEMt0nXEEbyTom6GXfUQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Well, I'm wondering if we ought to rename open access week "Open Data
Week"...

Following the Australian Research Council's excellent decision last week to
back, to some extent, open access, Alex Holcombe and I have written an open
letter to the ARC's new CEO to ask him to support open data. The letter is
here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bcrrzu4Ljono5V_UqdJogtB-043XmxWVkm-jH9kw3m0/edit

Please consider adding your name to the end. The letter, with a little
context, will be published in The Conversation next week, with a link to
the original online version.

Cheers from a wonderful OKFest in Helsinki,

Mat

Good idea. But I suspect the best strategy would be to create an
independent and possibly parallel Open Data Week. I think it could be a
real bottom-up (unlike OA which is top-down). Since a lot of Open Data has
already been bottom-up I think we could get a lot of concerted support from
the current active people (which includes research organizations and
funders).

We didn't get much of a chance to discuss it at OKFest (at least, I
didn't!), but I have added Open Access week to the agenda for the next WG
call.

The next Open Science working group call is taking place this Wednesday
(26th Sept) at 17:30 UTC (18:30 BST, 19:30 CEST etc).

The etherpad is here: http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-26Sep2012

Perhaps the Open Access group can also discuss it on their next call on
Friday?

Cheers,
Laura

Hi All

Instructions for joining the working group Skype call are in the email
below, it's been a while since we spoke and with OKFest out of the way,
there are open science ideas positively brimming over from attendees and
working group members. It's going to be tough fitting it all into 45mins
(we are going slightly shorter this month due to an open science local
group meetup).  If you have an idea to propose, would like help with a
project, or simply want to update people on an open science topic, please
add to the agenda on the Etherpad. The current agenda includes:

* OKFest: How did it go? Contacts, ideas and projects forthcoming
* Update on Open Research Data Handbook
* What should we do with 'Is It Open Data?'?
* Update on citizen science/DIY Bio activity
* What should we do for open access week (22nd-28th October) -
http://www.openaccessweek.org/
* Do we want an Open Data week?
* How can we help the open medicine/open clinical trial data community?
* Project Ideas
* AOB

I look forward to speaking to you on Wednesday!

Jenny

YES. It's about time something like this happened - SPARC has been quiet
and I look to them for some guidance. I haven't read the booklet, but
comment on the abstract


? Move the conversation from ?Is It Open Access?? to ?How Open Is It??
? Clarify the definition of OA
? Standardize terminology
? Illustrate a continuum of ?more open? versus ?less open?
? Enable people to compare and contrast publications and policies
? Broaden the understanding of OA to a wider audience

These are all critical. Until recently there was nowhere they could be
discussed without the discussion being destroyed.

But now we have OKF open-access !!

Let's offer this organ to the world and let's finally try to get a decent
discussion going.

Had a quick look. One comment (which I also submitted on the form):

  * "Generous reuse & remixing rights (CC-BY license)" - The allusion
to CC-BY is helpful, but it would also be good if this box explicitly
mentioned OpenDefinition.org as a standard for fully open licenses -
e.g. for cases where there may be bespoke or custom licenses.

We're adopting the BOAI original definition alongside the recommendations of BOAI10 here that CC-BY is best practice (for journal *articles*...not really referring strongly to data here) ie share-alike is not "open enough" in this domain.

Point very much taken Cameron. In which case - what about
"OpenDefinition compliant 'attribution style' licensing" which
shouldn't cause interoperability issues?

Or perhaps it isn't worth broadening from CC-BY (as it might have been
a few years ago) as people are much more likely to use CC-BY than to
roll their own, which of course should be encouraged.

Great. In which case perhaps the chart could just say that stronger OA at
the top should *be* CC-BY, rather than a liberal license like CC-BY? My
comment below re: licensing standard was intended to guard against liberal
interpretations of 'open' - that might include, e.g. NC or ND restrictions.

The Open Access movement is still fragmented and lacks a useful neutral
exposition. Its complicate because it is so religious and factional. So any
of my and other attempts to create a discussion are shot down, often with
inaccuracies. There is no useful document giving an idea of the rationale
and opportunities in OA. They are, for example, all predicated on the idea
that there is a 15 billion USD publishing industry, mainly for profit, and
that this is ordained as the optimal and unchanging way to publish.
Journals are still largely sacrosanct. The megajournals will somwhat change
this as will article metrics but who is administering this? T/R decide what
is and what is not an indexable journal and what a citation is. Within this
mess it is very difficult to provide best practice. However a  "neutral"
statement would be extremely valuable.

Data is easier at this stage because (a) most people haven't engaged (b)
there is very little commercial involvement and (c) we already have the
Panton Principles.  We *have* to get the mainstream involved in this -
especially funders. The almost total indifference of mainstream publishers
(BMC, PLoS? excepted)  to Panton, open Biblio principles and Open Content
Mining means we have a great deal of advocacy to do. But IMO this is
undoubtedly the way that we in OKF should go. Get clear principles, get the
community to discuss, refine them and then aggressively advocate. BOAI
is/was a great document, but the Harnadistas should never have been allowed
to corrupt it. And uncertainty and division is worth huge amounts to
commerce, who then make things worse if unconstrained.

Code. The only distinction for me is whether or not to allow viral
copyleft. My impression is that many people now deliberately choose one or
the other. I would not use GPL as I wish industry to use and re-use my
code. (I have to bite my lip when I see the distortions in chemistry from
some industry who rebadge and re-use without permission but the public/open
domain has few effective champions).  I can't say I would wish to require
BSD and forbid GPL and I think it's too late for that. And within the
BSD-like family you really have to be a lawyer to see al the ramifications.
I have personally had considerable problems being pressured to relicence my
LGPL (sic) code as BSD when a company (nameless here) was vitrioloc about
the Blue Obelisk but demanded a change of licence because it made static
linking easier for them. BTW I didn't choose LGPL - my code was part of a
larger system.

We *have* to insist on CC-BY for articles. It's simple and the good thing
is that funders understand and support it. We should create a simple
statement for what we want an article to be. Avoid all use of Green and
Gold. Kill the CC-NC serpent. I think this would be acceptable to current
CC-BY publishers.I think it would help to sway CC-not-quite-libre and
homebrewed licences. We would avoid all mention of fees etc.

Something like:
"For scientific communication and re-use of information it is essential to
license the article and all copies specifically and clearly. Terms such as
'open Access' should be avoided".
"The licence must explicitly allow use, reuse and redistribution consistent
with BOAI. We strongly recommend CC-BY (without the SA variant).
Non-commercial restrictions should be avoided at all costs"
"Where 'publications' consist of several components it is essential that
all carry a licence. In some cases (e.g. data-rich) it may be appropriate
to licence these as CC0 or PDDL".

IOW we come up with a Panton approach to scholarly articles. I think this
could now be compelling, engaging and for all except those with entrenched
minds valuable and adoptable.

I've got quite excited about this!

Thought I could make this meeting, but sorry I really can't, going to a
leaving-do tonight.

1 update of interest to note:

* I'm doing something for Open Access Week at the University of Bath, I'll
give a 30min talk as part of our social media week

details are still TBC but it's likely to be held at lunchtime Friday 26th
October on campus.
I don't even know if Bath has ever done anything for this event before, so
this small act in itself might be pioneering!

I will also try and write up a blog post on my blog (and cross post to OKFN
Science if wanted) about the OKFest ASAP

Best,

Ross

Subject: [open-science] Call for participation - on-line survey on the uses
 of research social networking applications
Message-ID: <CAP0yJMzq=OXprRT7MQO511sda=Z36JxWD5bR+b1WXmikTbe08g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Open Science mailing list members,

i'm Serena Cangiano, PhD Candidate at IUAV University of Venice and
research assistant at SUPSI, the University of Applied Sciences and Arts of
Southern Switzerland.

I'm doing a research concerning the use of research social networks (i.e.
Academia.edu, ResearchGate.net etc) within the academia.
I need to collect data about how these tools satisfy the researchers? needs
and which functionalities supports better the tasks of networking and
disseminating within the academic community.

Even if the use of this kind of application is now widespread, according to
my preliminary analysis there is still the need to understand how those
applications facilitate research activities.

I have already completed a benchmarking study of the existing tools and
applications that i will make available during the next weeks on the
research official blog: http://researchsocialnetworks.wordpress.com/

Unfortunately i wasn't able to share the results with you during the open
science session at OKFestival.
I hope next year i could be part of your topic stream since the beginning.

So, i write to kindly ask to to participate to this on-line survey about
the uses and users's needs.
The survey takes about 7 minutes.

This is the direct link to the survey:
http://lcvsupsi.wufoo.com/forms/research-social-networking-applications/

If you have question or should require more information about the project,
feel free to contact me here or by email serena.cangiano at supsi.ch

Thank you in advance for your collaboration.
Regards
Serena

Subject: [open-science] A short Science/Open Access based review of
	OKFestival 2012
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEx7TojJ8RqDJdSWTsQudEV4Vgf9D4ieJhORqFmFDpbOxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

just to let you know, I've written a short summary of my experience at
OKFestival 2012 here:
http://rossmounce.co.uk/2012/09/26/the-open-knowledge-festival-2012-helsinki-some-notes/

It's not an exhaustive recap of everything I saw - there were simply too
many excellent talks and hack events to do that, inevitably I have had to
leave some things out. But hopefully it might provide an interesting post
to point to with a couple of embedded videos of the Science / Open Access
talks.


Best,

Ross
