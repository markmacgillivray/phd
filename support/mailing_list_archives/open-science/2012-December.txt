Hi guys,

For the moment only 4 people have registered and everyone likes all the
proposed days :-) When do we close the poll? Should we say that this week
is the deadline?

Cheers,

Daniel

Message-ID: <CAGS_vfo=mwuOzRww+o=r6Mb3Ho32REFBJOy5671XpZPpJWBJkw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

This week, Patrick Meier from CrisisMappers.net contacted us about creating
an application in PyBossa for classifying tweets from the Pablo Typhoon
disaster in Philippines.

Today I've created an small application for helping them, and it is now
published in the front page of crowdcrafting.org. They need help in two
fronts:

1.- Classifying the tweets (it is really simple, hehe)
2.- Extracting the data from crowdcrafting.org

For the second item I think some of you could help as you are good
developers and they need to have this done by tomorrow, so any help is more
than welcome.

For downloading the data all you have to do is the following:

1.- Open this link in your browser
http://crowdcrafting.org/api/taskrun?app_id=211

The issue is that by default Crowdcrafting does not return more than 20
items/answers per page, but you can change that like this:

http://crowdcrafting.org/api/taskrun?app_id=211&offset=0&limit=100

offset for pages (increase it when you need it) and limit for the amount of
items that you want to get.

With the previous link all you get are the answers associated with the task
ID, so you need to actually do this first:

http://crowdcrafting.org/api/task?app_id=211&state=completed

This will give you all the tasks that have been completed, i.e. one with
ID: 3, then you can get all the answers for the completed and classified
tweet like this:

http://crowdcrafting.org/api/taskrun/3

Can someone help creating a small script for getting in one file all the
answers? Unfortunately I'll not be available tomorrow, so any help is more
than welcome!!!

Cheers and thanks in advance,

Daniel

Hi everyone,

I've some time left after dinner and I've coded the script to process the
results. The only problem is that we have to fix the pybossa-client as it
has a minor typo (Gregor, can you help? I've committed a patch to
pybossa-client, can you check it and if its correct upload a new version to
pypi so Patrick can use it on its own?).

The code is in the repository:
https://github.com/PyBossa/app-tweetclassification

Use the script getResults.py. It will download all the completed tasks and
write a CSV file. Adjoining you can find all the tasks completed and their
answers in CSV format.

If you want to use the script you will need to install the patched version
of pybossa-client, so can someone help in getting the results tomorrow?

Cheers,

Daniel

On Behalf Of Stephanie Taylor
Sent: 06 December 2012 16:36
To: JISC-REPOSITORIES at JISCMAIL.AC.UK
Subject: Call for chapters - Working with Text

Dear all,

please consider the following call for chapters; this work is part of JISC
horizon scanning activity in the area of text mining. Please also feel free
to pass on this call to any colleagues who might be interested but are not
subscribed to this list.

Regards,

Steph

Call for chapters
Working with text: Tools, techniques and approaches for text mining

Text mining tools and technologies have a long history in the repository
world, where they have been applied successfully for a variety of purposes.
These vary from pragmatic aims such as enabling document search and browse
facilities, linking related documents, identifying copies or facilitating
the deposit process, to support tools for academic research. The latter
category includes supporting research on the basis of a large body of
documents, facilitating access to and reuse of existing work, and
connecting the formal academic world with areas such as the traditional and
social media. The JISC have funded a number of projects and initiatives in
both areas, notably NaCTeM and the ResDis programme. Research areas as
diverse as biology, chemistry, sociology and criminology have seen
effective use made of text mining technologies.

However, the uptake and hence the impact of these tools has been uneven.
Several obstacles to development and deployment are frequently cited,
including the maturity, complexity, and in some instances cost of software
packages, as well as scarcity of relevant technical skills. Text mining
methods and tools can be fragile and complex, requiring significant set-up
time and effort. Projects making use of text mining may also suffer from
legal obstacles, such as copyright and intellectual property
considerations. The benefit to be gained from deployment of text-mining
tools in areas such as institutional repositories or as a research tool in
its own right may be difficult to predict without a costly pilot project.

Authors are invited to submit original, unpublished chapters describing
research in relevant areas and/or reviewing relevant literature and trends.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

Discipline-specific research involving text-mining: bioinformatics,
chemistry, the social sciences, etc.
Techniques in text mining: sentiment analysis/subjectivity analysis,
opinion mining, affect analysis, metaphor analysis, etc.
Legal and ethical aspects of text mining/analysis.
Current developments in text mining.
Metadata extraction from document text, including formal and informal
metadata: ontology extraction, document indexing, document classification,
and evaluation of metadata quality.
Text mining for document categorization or summarization.
Text mining for information visualization Text mining over the social web:
community detection, timelines, etc.
Evaluation of text mining tools, open-source or commercial: case studies
and findings.
Procurement and evaluation of text mining tools.

Submission

Chapters of 4,500-9,000 words in length should be prepared in either Word
or LaTeX. As chapters will be reformatted during the publication process,
authors are advised to concentrate on content rather than formatting.
Please include any images/graphics as separate files; images/graphics
should be 300dpi or better and designed to be readable when printed in
greyscale.

Files should be submitted by email to Emma Tonkin <e.tonkin at ukoln.ac.uk>.
All submitted chapters will be reviewed on a double-blind review basis.

Important Dates/Deadlines

24-Dec-2012         Title/Abstract submission for preliminary approval
4 -Jan-2013        Author notification
11-Feb-2013        Manuscript submission deadline
24-Feb-2013        Author notification

Publisher

This book is scheduled to be published in 2013 by Chandos, a leading
international publisher with specialisms in Library Management, Information
Management, Social Media and the Web; it will be distributed in the United
States via the American Library Association. It will be available both as a
printed publication and as a freely available Open Access resource,
increasing the visibility of the final work. For additional information

Message-ID: <7000a3bcf0efad13fc5285dd72cef339@sissa.it>

Hi everybody, I am looking for help :)

I am trying to draw up a list of postgrad/Master/PhD courses related to 
open science - i.e. courses on ICTs and society or media studies with a 
focus on science and/or courses in science studies with a focus on the 
role of the internet, open source or open access. Any suggestions? Thank 
you!

Ale

Do you also look for courses with mainly open source software used for it?

The Open Access Directory maintains a list of courses about OA.

If anyone on the list can help bring it up to date, please do!

     Thanks,

There is this group at the University of Montreal called Centre of Genomics
and Policy. This group has a project running: 'Reconciling Law and Ethics
with Open Science in Biotechnology Research' and I believe you could do a
PhD with them.

The link to the centre is: http://www.genomicsandpolicy.org/

The link to their project:

You don't mean courses that formally and actually involve open science do
you? There are none that I'm aware of. But FYI Jimmy Cronshaw just
completed his Honours degree course in Chemistry with me at Sydney Uni and
it was all open science - you can read the thesis he just uploaded to

Hi there,

It could be interesting to check the CRI research group from the Universit?
Descartes (http://www.cri-paris.org/en/cri/) They are trying a really
different approach for PhD and they work in the field of open-science :-)

Cheers,

Daniel

Thanks everybody for your suggestions. What I am looking for is courses 
in social sciences or media studies that deal with OS rather than 
courses that use OS tools.

I will share my list as soon as I complete it, and perhaps some of the 
courses I found might be interesting for the OA Directory

All the best,
ad

Dear all,

The most popular date for the session appears to be Tuesday the 18th at
15:00 GMT+1 (Amsterdam/Berlin)
One minor flaw of using the Doodle is that I do not have the email
addresses of the people wanting to participate. Send me a direct message
(please no reply all) and I will invite you to the Hangout next week.

Apologies if you are not able to join this time. If this formula works
well, we might be able to do another one in 2013.

Looking forward to it!

Best,

Joris

Please, also try to record the hangout so that we can use it to others
watch later. I've sent know this e-mail to OKFn Brasil and
Transpar?ncia Hackers folks who have attended an event about PyBossa
in Brazil <http://br.okfn.org/2012/07/31/dados-ciencia-cidadania-colaboracao-e-sustentabilidade/>.
Hopefully someone will join! Tom

Hi Alessandro

The University of Southampton Web Science Doctoral Training Centre has
students working on some of the issues you mention, I'm not sure if the
taught courses offered as part of the programme are relevant though

Hi,

I think it will be possible to video stream via Youtube :-)

From: Tom_Roche at pobox.com (Tom Roche)

Subject: [open-science] github breaks data hosting: alternatives?
Message-ID: <87d2yf5abx.fsf@pobox.com>


[caveat: I'm a student, without much scientific experience. Please
correct the following as needed; your comments are also appreciated.]

Much science informatics involves manipulation of input data, e.g., to
produce visualizations, or just refined data ("analyses," in met-speak)
for another stage in a pipeline. It's therefore useful for open-science
projects to host not only code but its associated inputs and outputs
(here called "I+O"). I found github's Downloads function (and esp
its scriptable Downloads API) convenient for this purpose, e.g., for

https://github.com/TomRoche/GEIA_to_NetCDF

I was able to host the code in the repository, and its I+O in Downloads,
keeping everything together in one project website. However,

https://github.com/blog/1302-goodbye-uploads
> December 11, 2012 
...
> GitHub previously allowed you to upload files (separate from the
> versioned files) in the repository, and make it available for download
> in the Downloads Tab. Supporting these types of uploads was a source
> of great confusion and pain ? they were too similar to the files in a
> Git repository. As part of our ongoing effort to keep GitHub focused
> on building software, we are deprecating the Downloads Tab.

> * The ability to upload new files via the web site is disabled today.

> * Existing links to previously uploaded files will continue to work
>   for the foreseeable future.

> * Repositories that already have uploads will continue to list their

So I'll need to migrate my inputs and outputs, or my projects entirely.
Where to? Your suggestions are appreciated. Some options (numbered
solely as they spring to mind) include

1. Bitbucket: also provides free public repos with a Downloads section,
   like the github status quo ante. (IIUC) upload/download is not
   scriptable; OTOH its wikis are much prettier than github's. So I'm
   inclined to migrate my stuff there. Any compelling reasons not to?

2. Github recommends Amazon S3

https://help.github.com/articles/distributing-large-binaries

   This has a "free tier" for up to 5 GB, which would cover me for now.
   It would be more separate from the rest of the project (i.e., the
   code repo) than currently, but that concern may just be purely
   aesthetic.

3. Figshare provides free space <= 1 GB, also separate from the rest of
   the project.

So how would you migrate something like

https://github.com/TomRoche/GEIA_to_NetCDF

presuming you had no external funding (and not much internal funding :-)
and wanted to keep the data close to the code? Note also that my field
is atmospheric (rapidly becoming Earth-system) modeling, so bigger is
definitely better when it comes to data-size limits.

TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

datahub.io (which is CKAN based) supports storing data and supports
uploading via the API (bulk data is actually stored in google storage
or s3 but datahub takes care of authentication etc). Data will be
separate from code but you can link to the code as a resource from the
datahub dataset.

Hi Tom,

The Github change is really a change of interface rather than a change of
functionality.  You could always commit the data files to a directory in
the repository (particularly if they are text files such as netCDF, but
even if they are binary) and link them from the repo's readme.   (If they
are binaries you probably want to add `?raw=true` at the end of the url so
the browser attempts to download the file instead of view on github, e.g.
https://github.com/cboettig/labnotebook/blob/master/assets/files/coloredNoise.pdf?raw=true).


Figshare provides unlimited space for public files, it just limits the size
of individual files (250mb/per file).  It is only the private upload space
that is limited to 1GB.  If I had big datasets I wanted to make public, I'd
probably stick them here and link them clearly from the README.md on
Github.  (Or if you go the S3 route, or CKAN or personal/institutional
server, you could still add the link to keep things "in one place".
 Likewise simply link back from the figshare page to the github repo, etc.)

- Carl

Tom --

Another option is to use one of the open community repositories dedicated
for science data archival and preservation.  For example, most of the
DataONE enabled repositories like the KNB and ORNL DAAC enable long-term
storage of data with an eye towards replication and reliability over
multiple decades (the KNB is 14 years old, and the ORNLDAAC is 16 years
old).  Using the DataONE API, you reference the globally unique identifier
for a data set (such as a DOI) in your R scripts, rather than a specific
file location or web location.  This allows the script to remain portable
and functional across systems, even when used in differing environments or
when the location of the data changes over time (because the DOI is used to
resolve the current location of the data, not the historical location).
 The DataONE R library is in testing now, and we'd love to have some folks
take a look at it if you are interested.

Matt,

Definitely a good point about both archiving stability and DataONE
integration.  I've actually never tried the interface to DAAC or KNB for
uploading data -- I see only information on how to download there data.
What license do they use? What restrictions are there on the kind of data
that can be uploaded, and required metadata? How is the persistent archive
maintained (e.g. LOCKSS/CLOCKSS or something else?)  (Sorry for the basic
questions, maybe you could you provide some links, my google-fu is failing
me).

Tom,

Re: figshare, data there is also given a DOI, files are permanently
archived by external geopolitical distributed http://clockss.org service,
and can be submitted and downloaded or browsed by the API.  Ruby, python,
and R packages exist for interfacing with the API.  (I helped write
rfigshare <https://github.com/ropensci/rfigshare>).  Most filetypes are
supported though plain text has archival advantages, minimal metadata is
author, title, a tag and a category.  These features of Figshare give you
some of the same advantages Matt mentions, but being part of the DataONE
ecosystem via these more established repositories has clear benefits too.

- Carl

Hi Carl --

The persistent archive is maintained by replication across institutional
boundaries, where a monitoring system keeps track of the data replicas
across all of the DataONE Member Nodes and makes sure that, if a node
disappears, that the data replication policies for data it held are still
followed.  There is a video showing how this system works here:
  http://www.dataone.org/depositing-data-into-dataone

The model is conceptually similar to a LOCKSS model, but the replication is
handled through a standard REST API, and with coordination among nodes from
the federation.  Replication policies for each object are determined by
initial contributors.

The DataONE API is documented, including both the data access and data
contribution REST interfaces, here:
    http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/MN_APIs.html
The API should work identically regardless of which DataONE compatible
repository you use, as we are trying to simplify interoperability among
these repositories.

In terms of what can be uploaded, that is determined by the participating
Member Nodes -- each node controls who can upload and what they can upload.
 For example, Dryad is participating in DataONE, and they will only be
allowing data associated with journal papers to be uploaded.   In contrast,
the KNB allows any data to be uploaded that is relevant to science and is
legal to redistribute.  DataONE recognizes that many metadata standards are
in use, and so it supports all of the common standards, and can be easily
extended to support additional standards.  For ecological and environmental
data, either EML, FGDC, or ISO19115 compliant metadata makes most sense,
although some groups use others (e.g., Dryad uses METS).  So, its really up
to the contributor.  There are no minimum science metadata requirements,
but there are a few system level metadata that are required (such as a
unique identifier, the type of the file, its access policy, etc).

In DataONE, the data use policies are set for each data package, rather
than for each repository.  Thus, any given repository can have data that
are CC0, CC-BY, or other licenses, and the user must inspect the science
metadata for each data package to determine what rights they have -- it is
specified by the data contributor.

Hope this helps clarify.

netCDF can be easily converted to/from text (it's a well-tooled format),
but (unless I'm very mistaken) all netCDF files are binary. They also
tend to be large, which (IIRC) can be problematic for git repos (but
ICBW about that, too).

I'll give KNB a try: more separately.

So for the benefit of the next open-science newbie, some observations
and questions:

* Initial contact with KNB is fairly intuitive: from the homepage above,
  one can see how to create an account, and that one should install and
  use Morpho

http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp

  to get data into KNB.

* Being a jar, Morpho is pretty easy to install and use (at least on
  linux), though

** There is nothing on the homepage to suggest that its installer is 84
   MB, so one may be surprised by the time required to download it.
   (More on progress UI below.)

** One should have some java background: at least, one should know
   how to define one's JAVA_HOME

* On running Morpho, one must input a lotta metadata, both for the "data
  package" (or project, i.e., data on oneself and one's collaborators)
  and for the actual data (or "data table"). I suspect this is much less
  onerous if one's data is text, since Morpho seems to have the ability
  to extract metadata from that, if available.

** (caveat: I may overestimate the global importance of my own concerns
   :-) One hopes Morpho will gain the ability to extract metadata from
   widely-used, explicitly-metadata-supporting (aka "self-describing")
   binary formats such as netCDF

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcdf#Format_description

** IMHO, a salient weakness of the Morpho UI is its lack of progress
   feedback. E.g., on choosing to save my data "to the network" (which
   seems to mean, to save to KNB--I confess to not Reading The Fine
   Documentation which installs with Morpho before using it), I hit a
   button on a dialog ... which just sat there for quite awhile, until
   completing (hopefully :-)

? Having (apparently) gotten the data into KNB, I'm now wondering, how
  to get it out programmatically? If I search Metacat for my data
  package, I can browse to the file. Should I just call that (ginormous)
  URI via, e.g., `wget`? Or is there API for this usecase?

** I see a lot more information on the KNB site about how to get data
   in, and how the infrastructure works, than about accessing data. The
   search interface seems pretty good, though.

? Where should one go for more detailed questions, bug reports, feature
  requests, etc?

?? Are there different user-level communities for DataONE and KNB? If
   so, how to determine which to access for a given problem/question/
   request?

Hi Tom --

To answer a couple of your followup questions...

> that one should install and use Morpho

Actually, you can use Morpho, or several other options, including the Web
form that is linked on the home page of the KNB entitled 'Register your
dataset online', or you can use the REST API to upload data and metadata
using your own scripts.  Our metadata tools are built to encourage the use
of good metadata, so tools like Morpho will prompt you for a fairly
complete set of information.  But that is not required -- using the REST
API you could upload bare files without much metadata, but we try to
encourage people to document their stuff more thoroughly. You are right
that Morpho is targeted at text files, and particularly csv files, and so
those are the easiest to enter.  You can attach netcdf and other binary
files, but Morpho can't parse those to help provide metadata.  I agree, it
would be a great addition to Morpho to support NetCDF more fully.  Alas,
open source... if you have an itch, scratch it.... or at least file a
feature request so we know there is a desire for such a feature.  Also
note, Morpho is targeted at user's that have never developed metadata, and
might need to upload a few data sets a year -- we step people through,
explaining each of the fields in fair detail.  It can get fairly tedious if
you have a lot of data to upload.  Once you are familiar with the metadata,
most people that process a lot of data transition to using scripts that
call the REST API.

You can get it from the DataONE REST API, which would be of the form:
    https://knb.ecoinformatics.org/knb/d1/mn/v1/object/{pid}
where {pid} is the permanent identifier for the object you uploaded.  The
API is documented at the link I sent earlier, and this particular method is
documented here:

http://mule1.dataone.org/ArchitectureDocs-current/apis/MN_APIs.html#MNRead.get

> ? Where should one go for more detailed questions, bug reports, feature
>  requests, etc?
For KNB, you can write to knb-help at nceas.ucsb.edu, or if you have
Morpho-specific questions, you can write to morpho-dev at ecoinformatics.org.
 If you have general questions about DataONE, you can write to
support at dataone,org, but remember that DataONE is the federation -- most
support for getting data into and out of repositories probably belongs at
the repository's own support channels.  We also have an IRC channel if you
want to talk to people more in real time -- connect on
irc.ecoinformatics.org in channels #kdi for Morpho/Metacat questions and
#dataone for DataONE discussions.  I can see we need to add these support
links to our web site -- I'll be sure to get them there.


> ?? Are there different user-level communities for DataONE and KNB? If

>   request?
Yes.  DataONE has the DataONE User's Group, which is appropriate for
questions and discussions about the broader federation that DataONE
represents.  KNB is a repository (one of many in the DataONE federation),
and so its user community is somewhat more focused -- mainly
ecological, environmental  and ocean sciences, although there are no hard
boundaries -- there's an incredibly broad set of data there.  For DataONE,
you can use 'developers at dataone.org' to discuss the DataONE APIs and other
features of the federation.

Let me know if you have further questions, or visit us on the KNB & DataONE
lists.

Regards,
Matt

Dear all,

tomorrow at 15:00 we will have our very first Crowdcrafting Hangout.
To speed things a little bit up, we would like you to install a few things
beforehand so we can get started right away.

You need to install Python <http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.3/> and
Git <http://git-scm.com/> (both just download from the site and run the
installer), if you don't have so already. When installing this myself, I
ran into a couple of errors. Apparently this is because of using Mac OSX
Mountain Lion. To solve this problem, you can download Xcode from the app
store and follow these instructions:
http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/mountain-lion-git-fix/

Then install virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/#installation>.
I had a few issues with permissions but by entering

sudo pip install virtualenv - in the terminal, I got it to work.

Then installing the pybossa client will be like this, i.e. for Flickr
Person Finder: (just copy these lines into your terminal, without the
numbers)

1.- git clone git://github.com/PyBossa/app-flickrperson.git
2.- cd app-flickrperson
3.- virtualenv env
4.- . env/bin/activate
5.- pip install pybossa-client

The last step will install pybossa-client and all its dependencies. Windows
users will have to download from the Git repository the ZIP files provided
by Github and unzip them instead of cloning the repository.

If you have not sent me your email address already and want to join
tomorrow, please do so!
If you run into troubles with installing, do ping me and I can see if I can
help.

All the best,

Joris

Hi, 


This seems to have caught my eye now but I think it's a really cool thing, crowdcrafting. I may not be able to join tomorrow but I am researching on equity crowdfunding. Would appreciate any thoughts or inputs from anyone interested in the topic.

Subject: HEADS UP! Workshop to inform requirements gathering exercise on
CKAN for academic RDM, February, Central London
To: RESEARCH-DATAMAN at jiscmail.ac.uk


Sent to the JISCMRD and the RESEARCH-DATAMAN lists, potentially of interest
to all JISCMRD projects and the wider community of interest in research
data management:

Both the Orbital (Lincoln) and data.bris (Bristol) JISCMRD projects have
recently adopted CKAN (http://ckan.org) as part of their research data
management technical infrastructure and we are aware that other
universities are also appraising it for their needs.  Joss Winn (Orbital
project, Lincoln) intends to produce a critical evaluation of CKAN for
HEI's research data management needs and would welcome your input at a
workshop in central London in February (date and venue to be confirmed).

The workshop is an opportunity to learn more about CKAN and to meet Mark
Wainwright from the Open Knowledge Foundation, which leads the development
of CKAN. Joss would also like you to feed into a requirements gathering
exercise that will steer his evaluation of CKAN for academic use. This
evaluation may also influence the future development of CKAN which will
benefit the higher education sector.

Whether you can attend or not, it would be very helpful if you can send
Joss (jwinn at lincoln.ac.uk) any user requirements documents or links to
similar requirements gathering exercises you have already undertaken for an
RDM system at your institution.

With many thanks in advance,

Simon.

Hi All

Just a nudge to see if anyone be interested in writing a chapter from the
working group, given we have several people with an interest in text
mining? If so, express your interest here soon as the abstract deadline is
24 December!

I and collaborators are very actively working on this and making all
resources available under OKD-compliant terms. The project is code-named
"AMI2" and is initially targeted at scientific and technical publications.

We use the excellent Apache PDFBox http://pdfbox.apache.org/ to extract the
contents of the PDF and are layering tools on top of this. The end product
- RSN! - will be XHTML with domain-specific inserts for math, chemistry,
graphs and tables. The vision is to read millions of papers each year and
extract data automatically.

We would very much welcome a community effort to help with things like
character encodings, sample material , knowledge of fonts etc.
alpha-testing, etc. The work is blogged under #ami2 on my blog - see
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/10/20/opencontentmining-the-ami2-project-for-understanding-the-scientific-literature-and-why-i-love-pdf/.

Be aware that "PDF" is not a simple concept. It can include:
* photographs of paper artifacts (challenging)
* scanned text (requires OCR)
* text with characters (common in modern PDF publications)
* text as vector graphics (i.e. no font info)
* bitmaps of tables, graphs, etc.
* vector graphics of graphs etc.

Where the document has vector graphics (which come from EPS files, PPT,
etc.) or characters the ease and quality of extraction is much higher than
for bitmaps. So whether any particular instance is feasible depends on
details.

Ross Mounce (OKF Panton fellow) and I are working very actively on this
area.


For the next School of Data tutorial I would like to cover Data extraction
>> from PDFs (and text) as well as OCR.
>>
>> Does anyone here have experience with Tools that do not require coding
>> skills to extract data and text from PDFs?
>>
>>
It's my intention to make this an automatic process - we have a little way
to go but it's months not years.

We'd be very interested in any who likes hacking this sort of thing.

Hi there,

You can have a look to these other libraries:

http://poppler.freedesktop.org/
http://mozilla.github.com/pdf.js/ <- This one is used in this PyBossa app
for transcribing PDFs that will need some humans, like for example scanned
images, vectorial ones, etc. Check the demo app here
http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftranscribe
http://www.gnupdf.org/Main_Page

Cheers,

Daniel

There is a web service hosted at the University of Manchester for converting scientific articles from PDF to XML:
http://pdfx.cs.man.ac.uk/
It is based on a product called Utopia Documents or UtopiaDocs:
http://www.utopiadocs.com/
Maybe this uses Apache PDFBox, and maybe not.

I copied in the contact for the web service and the info contact of UtopiaDocs.

Best Wishes

Andy

Subject: Re: [open-science] [School-of-data] PDF Extraction Tools (Michael Bauer)

I and collaborators are very actively working on this and making all resources available under OKD-compliant terms. The project is code-named "AMI2" and is initially targeted at scientific and technical publications.

We use the excellent Apache PDFBox http://pdfbox.apache.org/ to extract the contents of the PDF and are layering tools on top of this. The end product - RSN! - will be XHTML with domain-specific inserts for math, chemistry, graphs and tables. The vision is to read millions of papers each year and extract data automatically.

We would very much welcome a community effort to help with things like character encodings, sample material , knowledge of fonts etc. alpha-testing, etc. The work is blogged under #ami2 on my blog - see http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/10/20/opencontentmining-the-ami2-project-for-understanding-the-scientific-literature-and-why-i-love-pdf/ .

Be aware that "PDF" is not a simple concept. It can include:
* photographs of paper artifacts (challenging)
* scanned text (requires OCR)
* text with characters (common in modern PDF publications)
* text as vector graphics (i.e. no font info)
* bitmaps of tables, graphs, etc.
* vector graphics of graphs etc.

Where the document has vector graphics (which come from EPS files, PPT, etc.) or characters the ease and quality of extraction is much higher than for bitmaps. So whether any particular instance is feasible depends on details.

Ross Mounce (OKF Panton fellow) and I are working very actively on this area.

For the next School of Data tutorial I would like to cover Data extraction
from PDFs (and text) as well as OCR.

Does anyone here have experience with Tools that do not require coding
skills to extract data and text from PDFs?

It's my intention to make this an automatic process - we have a little way to go but it's months not years.

We'd be very interested in any who likes hacking this sort of thing.

Hi All

I just received this notification about the stakeholder dialogue 'Licences
for Europe' which will involve the European Commission setting up a range
of working groups. Of primary interest to us will be:

(iv) Text and data mining for scientific research purposes
This work strand should
? Identify the scale and nature of demand for TDM access in the EU for
scientific research
purposes, and appropriate means of meeting this demand.
? Explore the potential and possible limits of standard licensing models.
? Assess the appropriateness and  feasibility of technology platforms to
facilitate TDM
access.
? Deliver solutions, including the possibility to develop effective
platforms to facilitate
TDM access.

We would need a main representative to participate in the licence Working
Group and communicate with the rest of our own Open Science Working Group.
There is also the opportunity to propose initiatives or projects ourselves,
which could be of interest to those of you already working in this area (of
which there are several on the list!):

We invite you to consider with your members who of them would be best
placed to
participate inthe Working Groups of interest and relevance to you, and also
invite you to
propose initiatives or projects by individual organisations that might
assist the debate in
these areas.

If anyone would be interested in representing the OKFN Open Science group
in this consultation, has a proposal idea or would just like to express an
interest in being kept up to date, please let me (and the list) know!

Jenny

Message-ID: <CADPDqjHybpx2AjPiN7_jAbmWwoB-O=SSmWaPeypPaNn8gcfdMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody!

I'm member of the german pirate party and active participant in the working
group:
http://wiki.piratenpartei.de/AG_Geldordnung_und_Finanzpolitik

For more than 5 years I'm involved with our financial system and the crisis
in general.
The pirate party is working intensively on their program and the above
mentioned working group is concerned with the economic program.

We, as a working group are still busy with the task of reverse engineering
our financial system and have already come to several stunning conclusions.
What I would like to do is, to take our growing knowledge and put it into
an interactive model of our economy that will use real data as long as it's
available, that's grounded in doubleentry bookkeeping.
We already made a lot of static visualizations of aspects of the whole
system and i've created an excel sheet that explains the fundamental idea
of modelling and which can be used to simulate exactly one period manually.
For the next period you would need another sheet.

You can find the current version here:
