I wonder if it might be worth applying for this?

We applied last year (or the year before?) for something on open data
in science, but never heard anything back.

Perhaps we could do something more focused?

CALL FOR NEW CODATA TASK GROUPS 2012-2014



?Dear Friends and Colleagues:





CODATA is very pleased to announce the Call for New CODATA Task Groups
for 2012-2014.



Through its Task Groups, CODATA executes an ambitious international
scientific agenda, addressing major data needs and policy issues
across a broad range of subjects. Information on the current Task
Groups may be found at http://www.codata.org/taskgroups/index.html



Task Groups are selected at the biennial CODATA General Assemblies.
The 28th CODATA General Assembly is scheduled to take place on 1-2
November 2012 in Taipei. The proposals received will be peer reviewed
and discussed at the CODATA Executive Committee meeting in spring
2012. A recommendation will then be made to the General Assembly,
which will vote on Task Groups. Those Task Groups that are approved
will then be eligible for modest funding support at the discretion of
the CODATA Executive Committee.



Interested applicants must complete the attached application form and
send it to the CODATA Secretariat at codata at dial.oleane.com before 31
January 2012. Please complete it as comprehensively as possible. This
completed form shall be the primary document used when evaluating your
proposal.



Participation by scientists from around the world as members of the
Task Group and in Task Group activities is strongly encouraged.
Particular attention should be given to gender balance, the
participation of young scientists, and broad representation from
developing countries. Task Group activities must support CODATA?s
overall mission to strengthen international science for the benefit of
society by promoting improved scientific and technical data management
and use. Task Groups should also endeavour to support CODATA?s
strategic objectives and activities where appropriate, as articulated
in the CODATA Strategic Plan, 2006-12 (available on request). The
Strategic Plan is currently being updated for the 2013-18 period. Task
Groups may also wish to explore synergies with ICSU strategic
priorities (http://www.icsu.org/about-icsu/strategic-priorities).



I look forward to receiving your proposals.



Yours sincerely,

Dr. Robert S. Chen

Secretary General, CODATA

Message-ID: <CAN8ChJwCnDrtq3B5q5Dz3dgmqg6i87OFd=fCwX_D9kJtAvwdsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everyone,

I mentioned before that OSK's purpose is to identify and implement ways in
which open science might become more mainstream. I'm hoping to solicit your
commentary on this matter. Alternatively, here's a quick run down on some
of our projects. Please send along your ideas.

Visibility:

Open science (OS) is a paradigm shifting idea. Many scientists use pieces
of it, but, in my experience, the average scientist has no idea OS is a
viable option. For him/her, OS is a catchy yet inconvenient,
career-jeopardizing medium with almost no incentives. Because OS cannot
become reality based on utilization by zealots alone, the average scientist
must adopt it. For this to happen, the average scientist has to believe OS
will be the predominant scientific paradigm, challenging him/her to not use
it. At OSK, we believe visibility is the first step toward achieving this.

There are a remarkable number of scientists who immediately become
interested when I talk with them about OS. Most suggest the standard
impediments to implementation, including publish or perish, loss of grant
funding, etc. However, what really strikes me is that they have no idea
there're groups working on this issue. These scientists are definitely
interested in OS, voice the standard concerns with it, but have no idea
what else to do with it. They don't know who to contact for more
information, where to contribute ideas or $$, how to provoke an OS
dialogue. They don't know anyone doing open science and consequently can't
imagine doing it themselves.

We propose that OS becomes a brand.

OS is a collection of varied ideas and practices, but they all lead back to
a fundamentally different view of science than the one in place now. We
propose that OS adopts a symbol, like the one attached to this email, to be
noted on our websites, offered to our collaborators and colleagues who have
websites, and shared with strangers inadvertently practicing OS. This
symbol can supplement our business cards and adorn t-shirts and whatnot.
The conversations this symbol will provoke are free advertising.

We propose that OS employs some loose form of membership.

In Kentucky, we implement weekly meetings with OS-minded people, seeking to
constantly increase our membership. We are creating networks with our local
hackerspace and open source groups, facilitating dynamic discussions among
a diverse group of scientists with far reaching connections. We have a
Google group pulling it all together. Everyone we meet is offered
attendance at our meetings, and every attendee is offered admission to our
network. There is something tangible. Members are aware of their
membership. We hope they'll share it, put it on their CV's. Most
importantly, creating this membership creates ownership, encouraging new
blood to innovate in remarkable ways. Our plan is to implement similar
tactics in cities across the US, starting with the midwest (where we are),
subsequently creating a self-perpetuating movement. It's an exciting idea
and people want to be a part of it.

We propose that OS thinks like a business.

This isn't suggesting OSK should maximize profit or shareholder incentives.
Rather, successful businesses, both entrepreneurial and not-for-profit,
maintain a vision while simultaneously addressing the practical concerns of
implementing that vision. This includes market research, a successful
product, and marketing. In this case, we know OS is a great idea with
unlimited market potential. From reading the discussions on this message
board, it sounds like we've not yet agreed upon a product. Marketing may be
our most important, yet most poorly realized piece.

At OSK, we are beginning meetings with our friends in the marketing
community. We recommend each local group does the same. At a minimum, OS
needs to implement classical marketing strategies to increase its
visibility. This will include ground-level, grassroots, get-out-the-voice
type marketing. Better still, when novel ideas to increase OS's outreach
emerge locally, they can be shared with other OS groups for mutual benefit.
If there are successful outreach programs in place, we at OSK would love to
hear about them.

In terms of a successful product, we think open science itself is that
product. OS is thus the thing to market. Facets of OS like open publishing,
open access, open data, are icing on the cake. Successful marketing
campaigns don't elaborate on every piece of a product, just the most
innovative/desirable/interesting aspects. For example, trucks have HEMI
engines -- I have no idea what a HEMI versus any other engine is, but I've
seen it advertised on bumper stickers and I assume the HEMI comes with
powerful American trucks. OS is the innovative new thing, but it won't sell
if we constantly talk about every possible derivation of it. It's the
cultural change of OS that is so powerful. IMHO, the rest should be
reserved for those hoping to improve on OS that is implemented; there will
be plenty of time to utilize best-practices, but we must provoke the
discussion first.

We propose that OS forms clear goals and sets things in motion to achieve
them.

In our experience, if anyone at a meeting leaves without a clear set of
tasks to complete before a prearranged next meeting, very little will be
accomplished. Has OS established a culture of action? If not, we encourage
each of you to plan your next steps, to coordinate with others on the
message circuit to find bigger goals and task them out, to find allies in
the community to make things happen faster, all with an end point in mind.
We at OSK think it would behoove the group to set up a Google group for
OSK, list relevant goals and tasks there, and note what evolutions have
been successful/unsuccessful already. This will help us avoid repeating
mistakes, while helping us to stay in constant forward motion.

If you like our OS symbol, please feel free to add it to your website and
share it. If you have a better idea for a trademark, share it with us and
we'll use it. If you'd like to join us in any of our endeavors, please send
us a note.

Looking forward to hearing from everyone! Cheers!

The second sentence - and indeed the whole flavour of your posting - 
ignores the potential role of the funding bodies.   Sure, one possible 
route for the adoption of OS is from the grassroots up.   But another is 
that funding bodies promote it, in much the same way that (in the UK at 
least) there is now an obligation to include a Knowledge Exchange 
component in research proposals (and that certainly did not come from a 
groundswell of opinion in the research community itself).  I can see 
some good reasons why they could well choose to go down this route.  I 
can also see some good reasons why they may not.  But at least we should 
entertain the possibility, and indeed consider ways of getting them to 
see that it's actually in their own interest to encourage/require some 
degree of OS in funded projects.

Cheers,
Robert

Thanks for your commentary, Robert.

OSK agrees completely that a multifaceted approach is warranted. Our
organization's intention is to inspire more OS awareness/action among those
participating in science, day to day, so that funding agencies will realize
accounting for the OS-practicing community's contributions is indeed
necessary. This will increase incentives in both directions.

Andrew,

Thanks for these ideas. Marketing and promoting a vision are unquestionably
important. But I worry that we're already talking a lot ABOUT open science
(many excellent journalists are writing very supportive and perceptive
pieces), and what we could use are more people in the lab DOING it. (I
think that is your ultimate intention, naturally) For that to happen I
think our efforts should not necessarily be to convince people of open
science's merits, in abstract, but rather to show examples where it's
really worked, or much better, actually do such projects ourselves. One of
the main motivators behind the piece we recently published (
http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html) was
exactly that - a real example you could point to where openness had helped
the research, and to explain why it had helped the research.

I'd also suggest it's going to be difficult to brand something like open
science. Open source software projects/products have brands, so that
poor/unwanted contributions can be cleanly separated from quality work.
That will be important for open science projects too, eventually. But I
would say we're likely to a very broad church.

One thing that will need to be addressed soon is what constitutes open
science, however. I worry some people still seem to think that occasional
blogging about one's results, based on data that have not been exhaustively
shared, counts as open science. It doesn't. For me this is a central issue
and one where discussions of branding might usefully centre. Jean-Claude
Bradley developed some logos for open notebook science a while back you
might want to look at along those lines.

I would agree that the funding agencies are important to get on board, for
a number of reasons. We heard on Tuesday our open source drug discovery
project for malaria was funded for the next 3 years (funders are the
Australian Research Council and the Medicines for Malaria Venture,
together). It's not just that this allows us to make a good job of the
project, it's also that such instances, piece by piece, make open science
(especially for drug discovery) seem slightly less nuts than it's sometimes
made out to be.

Cheers,

Mat

I agree with several points in Mat's post.


One thing that will need to be addressed soon is what constitutes open
> science, however.


Yes. This is critical. "Open" can be applied to static information and
dynamic processes, to philosophy, intent, labelling. I have blogged several
times abou how "Open" is used as a fuzzy feelgood marketing label.

I also think that science is too broad for "Open" - it needs to be broken
into different areas. Thus I started a page on Wikipedia on "Open Data"
which was science oriented and it was, I think usefully, aliased to "Open
Science Data". Similarly Jean-Claude Bradely started "Open Science" - I
think - to indicate his process of publishing experiements as they were
done, and this was quickly relabelled "Open Notebook Science". So I think
the area is too broad for a single label.

The success of the Open Source movement is that it relates simply to
licences.This is amechanism which is simple to understand and use as a
measure. There are OSI-compliant licences and they are rigorously vetted.

By contrast the Open Access movement cannot agree what is meant - in
practice - by Open. There is "green" and "gold" - neither of which are
rigorously defined. They are useful but there is no consistency of
practice. In particular the rights of re-use are poorly defined.

We deliberately avoided this in Panton and spent a long time formulating a
definition and associated practice. "You have to do this and this" for your
material to be accepted as Open Data.There is no mention (deliberately) of
the complete scientific process - there is a notional point-of-publication
where Panton becomes applicable.

Our mantra in the Blue Obelisk ("Open" for chemistry software and data) is:
"Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source".

Data and Source are well defined and implentable. "Open Standards" drew a
lot of discussion because it was not defined. Some felt that a published
proprietary standard was open, and that a non-proprietary standard, even
under an OKD-compliant licence, was only a standard if the means of
creating the standard was democratic (e.g. anyone could alter the
standard). Not surprisingly we have let this discussion run its course and
indeed our efforts are to writing tools and validators (as Mat has
suggested). FWIW I am now working on "Open computational chemistry". This
will consist of having at least one completely Open Source suite (e.g.
NWChem under Quixote), and that the data are Panton-compliant and that we
use "Open Standards" without making too much fuss at present. But questions
as to "when" the process should become open are currently left to
individuals and projects.

The World Climate Research Program held a conference in Denver last
week called the Open Science Conference.  This was intended to be
parsed as "open science-conference" (a conference open to all
[climate] science disciplines and groups), not "open-science
conference" (which would be something more akin to the Open Science
Summit).  An interesting use of the word, and slightly confusing for
people doing open climate science.

Thanks Paul!

I did notice Tracey mention that the 2012 conference would be about
open data in science. Very exciting! Are there any links or further
information about this?

I'm sure that many of those involved in our Working Group on Open Data
in Science [1] would be interested in participating in this!

Very *very* interesting, indeed! I learned about CODATA years ago but
did almost forget about it. Great to see open data on the agenda of
next years conference. Thanks to Paul and Tracey for sharing this
information.

Paul,
I am very excited about this. I don't know whether I will be able to come.

As you may know I have had a long association with CODATA having been asked
to talk on 2 or more occasions. John Rumble and I have met many times. Also
we have published our ideas in CODATA's DataScience journal - with Jack
Smith's help .

Since then I have become even more involved in semantic scientific data and
developed the ideas in those papers (open markup languages). More recently
I have become heavily involved in the OKF and helping to promote the ideas
of Open Science (and open access to the fruits of scientific research). I
am becoming increasingly concerned that academia is a closed shop, looking
inwards and only publishing to themselves. *We need to take science out to
the whole world.*

Dear All

I'm sorry to say that the proposal for an open data in science session at
ESOF 2012 we submitted back in July was unsuccessful.
Thanks ever so much to everyone who helped write it - especially Maria and
Daniel, it was a lot of work in a very short timeframe.
We can try again in 2014.

If anyone sees a conference that they think could benefit from a session on
open data - and which couldn't? ;) please don't hesitate to forward it to
the list and the working group will be more than happy to assist you in
putting a proposal together, or put one forward ourselves if applicable.*

*We'd also be interested to find out if anyone else put forward an open
science proposal to ESOF and was accepted (I'm still planning to attend so
I'll come and say hi!)*

*Jenny*

 Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for submitting a proposal for the ESOF 2012 Science Programme
under the following title:

*?Hands off my data! Is science ready to open up??*

 Our call for proposals was a huge success and Dublin is now shaping up to
be the biggest and best ESOF to date.  Due to the fact that an
unprecedented number of high quality proposals were received, over 400, the
review process has been quite lengthy and your patience during this time is
much appreciated.

There will be approximately 80 sessions on the ESOF 2012 Science programme
and it has been a huge challenge for the International Programme committee
to make the final selection. I regret to inform you that your proposal has
not been successful.

We greatly appreciate the time and effort you took to prepare your proposal
and hope that you will still attend ESOF 2012 in Dublin.  The conference
will attract delegates from right across the globe and from all areas of
research, and will provide you with many valuable opportunities for both
structured and informal networking.

Should you require further feedback, please email Emma Critchley at
emma.critchley at chiefscientificadviser.ie

We look forward to welcoming you to Dublin next July.

Yours sincerely,

** **

Hi all,

Here is a quick update on Stockholm Open Science. We have had four
lunch meetings so far, on the first Thursdays of the month, which 2 or
3 people attending each time, including me. We talked about various
things during these meetings, like Bioclipse, bibliographic tools,
#altmetrics, bits about open data, etc.

There were more people interested, so for the upcoming last meeting,
we used a Doodle, and had 13 people sign up :)

http://www.doodle.com/g3ke3m6h6izh9ay9

Thus, December 12 is our last lunch meeting this year. It will also
for myself be the last meeting at all, as me and my family are
returning to the Netherlands, to start a position in Maastricht in
January [0] (yeah, I'm already looking at an Open Science node there).
So, continuation will be one of the things to discuss that day, and a
new driving force in particular.

The website is not online yet, but we have now a mailing list via
OKFN: stkhmos at lists.okfn.org. So, if you happen to be in Stockholm on
the 12th and want to join, join the last and just asked the geo
coordinates of where we'll have lunch :)

Greetings from Sweden!

Egon

Hi, all,

Working on a post for either Open Science
Kentucky<http://opensciencekentucky.blogspot.com/> or
the Open Science Working Group exploring things open science does around
the world.

How has open science been used to make a difference? Has open science been
used to overcome seemingly impossible challenges? Are you using open
science in ongoing projects? On a smaller scale, are you all using open
science from day to day in innovative ways? How?

What I'm looking for is documentation of "tangible" successes and failures,
things like the polymath project. Links appreciated!

If we make finding information about these projects more accessible, it
will certainly be easier to replicate them.

Cheers!

Andrew Ramsey

(...)

I have subscribed to this list because it was requested on 
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/devcsi/life-sciences-hackdays/index.html -
- I intend to take part in the SWAT4LS hackathon on December 7th. But of
all the discussions that take place here, none seem to be related to the
hackathon. Did I come to the right list?

Thanks Jonathan!

Sadly, the data digitiser is currently aimed at aiding manual transcription
of tabular data from PDFs/images rather than automating the process as the
second blog describes, which would obviously be very awesome but we quickly
decided impossible in a day (Dd was hacked together at the Open Science
Workshop) if not impossible full stop. I get the impression with automated
digitisation that maintains tabular structure that many have tried
extremely hard and all have failed thus far, although if anyone knows of
any open projects that are getting close then let us know!

I've commented on
http://www.aboutsocialdata.org/tag/open-knowledge-foundation/ with words to
this effect.

There is no magic bullet. It depends very much on the source. If the
material is written as a table from (say) an Adobe product then it may be
possible to recover this with the same product.This costs money and I don't
know whether it can be run in the batch. Anycase I think it's rare.

Lee Giles and Prasenjit Mitra have worked on this (Cite Seer, Penn State)
and  can get up to 80-90 Precision/recall. That is with a years' work. If
you have a specific source then heuristics can be applied. If the PDF has
preserved line primitives then it's possible to make progress (I have done
this for chemistry). If it's a bitmap then you have a hamburger.

Our effort is better spent trying to change culture, I think. But it's a
massive task in science. After all scientific data in journals belongs to
the publishers, doesn't it :-(

I don't know anything in this space in the open source world, but my
experience with the proprietary "Abbyy FineReader" tells me that
automatically identifying and reproducing tabular structure is
definitely possible.
(it's an OCR system, and give it a document with tables and it
produces a document with more-or-less matching tables).

Hi All

Just to draw your attention to the 7th International Digital Curation
Conference happening on 5-7 Dec http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc11/programme
There looks to be some excellent talks and several members of the working
group will be there.

If anyone is planning to go and blog the event, please let me know as we
would love to post/cross-post summaries and highlights on
science.okfn.orgfor those who can't attend (several of whom are
running the SWAT4LS
hackathon instead!)

Best wishes

Jenny

Hello All:

Just came across this today in the Knowledgespeak newsletter and thought
some on this list might be interested:
http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/gigascience_a_repository_for_large

"*This is the first time that a dataset has been cited as a DoI in an
article's reference list, so is the first step in the process leading to
researchers getting citation credits for the data they generate.*"

Happy Thanksgiving to those Americans on the list!

This is a nice example of re-use of open access science content.  The books mostly comprise collections of OA articles plus some videos, bound together with an introduction and some other newly-written text.

Subject: [open-science] European Commission to adopt Open Data Strategy
Message-ID: <CAMPqvY_D1K9hN48hoKjwKh5dt4nJGq4-dgSzzWrUuPYTJz6hAg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

with interest I read the blog post and matching euralert... while
provisions like "[t]his Directive does not contain an obligation to
allow re-use of documents" (9) dampen my enthusiasm, it seems like a
good step forward.

Not being a lawyer and illiterate with the design of the EU in
general, I was wondering about this point:

"(10) The definitions of "public sector body" and "body governed by
public law" are taken from the public procurement Directives
(92/50/EEC(5), 93/36/EEC(6) and 93/37/EEC(7) and 98/4/EC(8)). Public
undertakings are not covered by these definitions."

What is included under this public sector to which the directive
applies? Particularly, does this include EU organizations that perform
research around health, toxicity, etc, such as ECHA? The use of terms
of "public sector", "public sector body", and "public undertaking" is
not helping me...

That above provision given, what does this directive mean for such
organizations? For example, is regulation around toxicity of chemicals
under REACH falling under this directive?

Looking forward to any and all information, thanks in advance,

Egon

I like the idea but I am not sure the complex mix of licenses will fly
in the long run.

Subject: [open-science] Data governance - any recommendations to research
	funders?
Message-ID: <CAN6n2b2i2=b3vGYK9abGEdrb-U97GPtxV1ufqNMROX3xuoBmSw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am planning to attend a workshop on data governance on Dec 14-15
that is meant to provide research funders like the Office of
Cyberinfrastructure (OCI;
http://www.nsf.gov/dir/index.jsp?org=OCI ) of the NSF with
recommendations as to how to handle issues around data sharing - how
to encourage it and how to help ease any problems occurring on the
way.

Special attention will be paid to large-scale data sharing, to issues
of how to license, cite, reuse, combine and annotate data, how to
ensure permanence, and how to evolve policies in this area.

Since many of you on these lists are thinking about such issues,
please share your thoughts, so that we can inject them into that
discussion. I am collecting my notes at
http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/DataONE_Workshop_on_Data_Governance_2011
, which anyone can edit with their Wikipedia account or under their IP
(no login required).

Thanks and cheers,


Daniel

1) The hashtag #devcsi seems to relate to a number of events, as such, can we possibly use one specific to the event in question? Can I again suggest #openrr or #openrr11 (or something similar and/or included #devcsi) ?? bla bla bla 

2a) The event kicks off at 17:30 on 6th December, "Venue bar" but the venue itself is not specified. I never assume, but would this be the Dog and Duck in Soho ?? I don't know.

2b) Day two starts at 08:30 "room to be arranged". Might this be at the ULU, Malet Street.

Sorry, but I always like to plan my journeys in detail ahead of time.

Thanks,

Graham

Hi Graham

1) We should use both, not everyone will be working on ORRs (there may be
other Semantic Web Applications for the Life Science projects on the go) so
#devcsi for the hackathon and I'd go with #openrr for ORR related stuff -
maybe we could reach consensus on the first evening.

2) The whole event is taking place at University of London Union, Malet
Street, Bloomsbury, London, WC1E 7HY. Venue bar = ULU bar and the room will
be somewhere in ULU, I assume there will be signage :)

For anyone who is new to the list and isn't familiar with open research
reports or the Semantic Web for the Life Sciences hackathon that the
working group is organising, please check out the event page
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/devcsi/life-sciences-hackdays/programme/index.html
There is still space for more hackers (coding skills not necessarily
required, there is much more to do, particularly for ORRs)
You can find an intro to ORRs here
http://science.okfn.org/2011/10/29/okfn-at-oss2011-open-research-reports/and
I'll be sending general updates to this list. For technical

Phew,

I spent yonks booking a cheap hotel on Saturday, so glad to know I'll be staying about 2 mins walk away from the main venue (as I suspected).

Thanks,

Thanks Sam

Index on Censorship has an issue coming out this month along a similar line
entitled 'Dark Matter: What's science got to hide?"
http://www.indexoncensorship.org/darkmatter/
Comments welcome when the piece is out, I'm sure many of the issues looked
at will be relevant to this list.

Sadly, I know many members of the working group will be at the SWAT4LS
hackathon we coorganised (
http://www.ukoln.ac.uk/events/devcsi/life-sciences-hackdays/programme/index.html)
or at the International Digital Curation Conference (
http://www.dcc.ac.uk/events/idcc11) and so miss the debate, but please
shout up if you're going and any offers of a write up for
science.okfn.orgwould be most gratefully appreciated :)

Let the list know if you're planning on tweeting so those of us who are at
the other events can keep up with developments!

Hi Jenny,

I am planning on going and would love to blog about it. Good luck with the
hackathon and do send through any post-event materials you have so we can
cross post them to the main OKFN blog.

Can anyone grab the audio? It would be great to be able to grab some

Very interesting.  I don't believe it is at all fair to any of the
parties involved in the 'climategate' story, but it does express this
key point: "The wider world instinctively knows to distrust those in
all walks of life who reject openness."
