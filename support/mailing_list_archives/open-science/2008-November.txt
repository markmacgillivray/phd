Call for Papers - Openness and the Future of Higher Education

This Call for Papers is for a theme issue of the International Review of
Research in Open and Distance Learning <www.irrodl.org> entitled:
Openness and the Future of Higher Education. The projected publication
date is October 2009. The Guest Editors are Dr. David Wiley and John Hilton.

The aim of this Special Issue is to further our understanding of the
manner in which the open source, open access, and open education
movements are now and will impact higher education organizations,
learners, and other stakeholders in the future.

Our intent is to stimulate critical debate, encourage collection and
analyses of relevant data, and add to the theoretical foundations used
in policy and planning discussions related to openness within
institutions of higher education. Special consideration will be given to
articles that present analyses and interpretations of empirical data,
but rigorous theoretical submissions will also be considered.

All submissions will be peer reviewed. Those submissions accepted for
publication will be published under Creative Commons license in
www.irrodl.org.

DEADLINES:

* Submission Proposals: January 15, 2009
* Notification of Acceptance: February 15

* Peer Reviews Returned: June 30
* Finalized Papers Due: August 1

proposal of approximately 500-750 words to IRRODL's Managing Editor at

words. For IRRODL's submission guidelines, visit:

All full-length papers submitted to IRRODL will be subject to multiple
