Subject: [open-science] CC0 RDF hosting service
Message-ID: <AANLkTinctc5JfQo_DOtoUyzK=mLiN7Mk_EWWKFk4Y+gu@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Mark Hahnel has extended his Science 3.0 website with a CC0 RDF
hosting service. The purpose is small data sets, like results from
experiments.

http://www.science3point0.com/opendata/

It is still new, and most certainly not in its final form. Yet, this
should be of such interested to the Open Science community I had to
forward the new here.

With kind regards,

Egon

profit. Last year hackathon registration was just 20EUR to cover basic
costs. Should we find sponsors, we can make the event open.
At the moment the practical details of the organization are a bit confused,
as we have a major player from US which was interested in co-organizing, bu=
t
it's clear anymore. I'm holding for the time being both ULU and Welcome
Trust Collection sites. Hackathon would be more likely in the former (or
perhaps even in some university in London).

Dear Andrea

Thank you for contacting the OKF regarding running an open data event in
conjunction with the SWAT4LS conference in December. Your email was
forwarded to the Open Data in Science working group and there are several
members who are keen to organise something.

In terms of the type of event, you mentioned either a workshop or an evenin=
g
event in your email. We would be keen to organise both, with an open data
hack day followed by a presentation of the work from the day and some
speakers, if that sounds good to you.

Some of the topics that came up on the list were:
Open Research Mapping of malaria research to form a figurative and literal
map of open research/data including timelines, geolocation, citation links,
etc.
Building an open data toolkit such as guides, publicity materials to raise
people=92s awareness of the importance of open data.

The idea is for this to be a practical workshop, where people will learn
about the issues surrounding open data while creating something useful for
the scientific community. In addition, people who want help with specific
open data questions will be working alongside those who are likely to be
able to answer them.

We'd be very keen to hear your views!

Best wishes

I&#39;m definitely in favour, I&#39;ve attended the last two ESOFs and thou=
ght they were really good. They attract a cross-disciplinary crowd with rep=
resentatives from sci comm/publishing/policy/industry etc as well as resear=
chers. There&#39;s usually a lot of early career scientists in particular b=

2. The creation of some basic guidelines on preparing/publishing
additional (supplementary) files. Comprehensive information on "what do
we mean by data?" wasn't deemed necessary (or possible) but some basic
principles might be useful e.g. supplementary tables should not be
provided as PDF files.

One would think so - are there any publishers on the list who wouldn't
mind giving their perspective or explaining the challenges?

This trend continues with new activities from NCEAS and the DataONE project.
 For example, we just held two workshops at this month's ESA meeting, one on
Data use and re-use that drew 51 scientists, and one on writing Data
Management plans that drew 212 participants.  We have upcoming workshops of
this sort at the Environmental Information Management workshop in September,
at Super Computing 2011 in November, and at the American Geophysical Union
meeting in December. Slides and information on these DataONE activities are
here:

Hope this is helpful in some way.

surmise that the NCBI taxonomy, presumably with a bias toward human
and model organisms, as well as its adoption by Uniprot, should be the
preferred choice for expressing taxon info in the context of
biomedical knowledge?

Next question (thinking that I know the answer) is how to integrate
datasets that use one of each: NCBI and Darwin? Of course, we can
shelve this and come back to it some other year, if we want to dig
into something more specifically biomedical. The issue will eventually
come back to haunt us in any case. For example, with chemical
identifiers..

Also, is taxon out of scope for Identifier.org ?

Cheers,
Scott

===================================
[Jerven]
Hi All,

Don't wish to spam the mailing list about which taxonomy to use. However if
you actually look at the darwin and uniprot taxonomy "schema" then they are
very similar. And even in the taxonomy world it doesn't have that many
controversies.

Its the instances that get hairy.
i.e. is it

Dugu is a rodentia
<purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10160> rdfs:subClassOf <
purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9989>
or
Dugu is a Caviomorpha
<purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10160> rdfs:subClassOf <
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caviomorpha>

Which gets taxonomist all exited :)

Mapping schemas is easy to do here. Its mapping instances that get the
feuds started :D

Regards,
Jerven

============================================
PMR comment - this isn't spam, it's science!
============================================
PMR - thanks for this. If we can make progress on identifiers it makes *me*
happy!

<br>
All taxons in the UniProt taxonomy can be found via (<a href=3D"http://purl=
.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10305" target=3D"_blank">http://purl.uniprot.org/taxo=
nomy/10305</a>).
 This is synchronized with the NCBI taxonomy and is the same in the=20
public version (release delta excepted). Some limited NCBI taxonomy=20
curation happens at the Swiss-Prot group which also does the UniProt rdf
 work (Guess where I work ;).<br>
<br>
In this case you actually have an link in rdf from the herpes virus to=20
its hosts. The proteins it encodes (might not be all for each virus=20
isolate e.g. in this case only a single virion membrane protein is=20
known) and links to relevant papers as well as related virion proteins.<br>
Will love to show you all how you can get this data in RDF and work with it=
 using SPARQL.<br>

surmise that the NCBI taxonomy, presumably with a bias toward human<br>
and model organisms, as well as its adoption by Uniprot, should be the<br>
preferred choice for expressing taxon info in the context of<br>
biomedical knowledge?<br>
<br>
Next question (thinking that I know the answer) is how to integrate<br>
datasets that use one of each: NCBI and Darwin? Of course, we can<br>
shelve this and come back to it some other year, if we want to dig<br>
into something more specifically biomedical. The issue will eventually<br>
come back to haunt us in any case. For example, with chemical<br>
identifiers..<br>
<br>
Also, is taxon out of scope for Identifier.org ?<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D<br>[Jerven]<br>Hi All,<br>
<br>
Don&#39;t wish to spam the mailing list about which taxonomy to use. Howeve=
r
 if you actually look at the darwin and uniprot taxonomy &quot;schema&quot;=
 then=20
they are very similar. And even in the taxonomy world it doesn&#39;t have=
=20
that many controversies.<br>
<br>
Its the instances that get hairy.<br>
i.e. is it<br>
<br>
Dugu is a rodentia<br>
&lt;<a href=3D"http://purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10160" target=3D"_blank">pu=
rl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10160</a>&gt; rdfs:subClassOf &lt;<a href=3D"http:/=
/purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9989" target=3D"_blank">purl.uniprot.org/taxonom=
y/9989</a>&gt;<br>

or<br>
Dugu is a Caviomorpha<br>
&lt;<a href=3D"http://purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10160" target=3D"_blank">pu=
rl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10160</a>&gt; rdfs:subClassOf &lt;<a href=3D"http:/=
/dbpedia.org/resource/Caviomorpha" target=3D"_blank">http://dbpedia.org/res=
ource/Caviomorpha</a>&gt;<br>

<br>
Which gets taxonomist all exited :)<br>
<br>
Mapping schemas is easy to do here. Its mapping instances that get the feud=
s started :D<br>

iring and salary freezes, furloughs, salary cuts, layoffs, nonrenewals, red=
uction and elimination of academic programs and colleges, revision of curri=
cula, changes in academic policy, elimination of tenure, substantial change=
s in workload&quot;...<br>

k">http://www.aaup.org/aaup/<u></u>financial/mainpage.htm</a><br>
<br>
As a personal story, lack of financial security is one of the reasons why I=
 use CC-NC. The vast majority of my own work is not funded at all. This is =
increasingly common in the social sciences and humanities. There could be a=
 point in time where I might have good reason to want to try to sell some o=
f my work, to pay my rent and grocery bills. Not that I personally am that =
important, but the measures mentioned above indicate that I have plenty of =
company. Like most scholars and publishers, I am the 99%.<br>

<br>
If I gave away my work and saw that someone else had sold it and kept the p=
rofits for themselves, I would be MAD. Not only at them - but also at anyon=
e who told me that I should give away my work. If I was among those who wer=
e recently laid off, and I saw someone else profiting off my work, I would =
be REALLY REALLY MAD. Wouldn&#39;t you?<br>

<br>
Publishers also need resources in order to produce work, whether this is pa=
id, volunteer, or in-kind. There are some areas where funding is generous a=
nd full support for OA via article processing fees may well be feasible. Ho=
wever, in many scholarly areas funding is much less generous, and publisher=
s may NEED to reserve commercial rights. Even with the well-funded areas, i=
f publishers develop hybrid revenue streams by reserving commercial rights,=
 that might well make it possible to offer more affordable article processi=
ng fees to academia.<br>

<br>
Regarding CC abandoning NC: I am trying to recommend to CC (if I can get re=
gistered to speak) that they adjust the licenses rather than abandoning NC.=
 For example, if there is concern that people are interpreting NC as not in=
cluding educational rights, then add a statement to the NC license along th=
e lines of &quot;Education is not commercial&quot;. Not only would this imp=
rove the NC license, in the long term I believe that this will add to suppo=
rt for good overall copyright licensing on an international level, as educa=
tion should be understood as noncommercial, period. If CC abandons NC, I wo=
uld have to abandon CC. (I would like to note that I am a strong supporter =
of CC today - I speak out for CC, use the licenses, encourage others to do =
so, and contribute to the annual donation campaign).<br>

<br>
While we are on the topic of CC licensing, some comments about the other el=
ements:<br>
<br>
SA: this is necessary to ensure that authors, their publishers and institut=
ions, who give away their works have access to derivatives built on them. T=
his is not just a third-world problem. I hear that there have been severe f=
unding cuts to higher education even in the UK.<br>

<br>
Noderivatives: there are valid scholarly reasons why noderivatives may some=
times be a superior license. One example is the area at the boundary of pha=
rmacology and toxicology. Here, relying on an imperfect translation could k=
ill people. Another is that in some scholarly areas, such as literature and=
 art, creative expression is the very heart of the scholarship. It strikes =
me that many scholars would be more likely to share their work if they felt=
 comfortable that they had the right to insist on no derivatives.<br>

<br>
I hope this message gets through to the list - my last two messages to the =
open science list don&#39;t seem to have gone through.<br>
