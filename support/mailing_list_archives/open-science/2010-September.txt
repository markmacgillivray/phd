Egon, I agree.  I've responded to PLoS asking them to clarify:

Dear Mark,

Thank you for your straightforward, quick, and positive response to our
enquiry.

I have one question for clarification: does PLoS consider data to be
available under CC-BY, or may it be used and redistributed under CC0, PDDL,
and the like?

Thanks!

Heather

btw, blog post summarizing these enquiries:

Indeed, but of all places, this list would be the place to do it right, not?

Yes, I am aware of this; and I think getting this 'legally' right is
very important. Actually, one of the reasons I asked about it...

Quite so.

(This is also why I commented on the JChemInf 'guidelines for the
authors', as any new journal can do it 'right' from the start...)

What is Open Notebook Science (ONS)? 

How does it differ from Open Access (OA)?

What does ONS mean for researchers?

What does ONS mean for publishers?

What does ONS mean for librarians?

What role do institutional repositories have to play in ONS?

Dear Colleague,

Below is a link to a release detailing BioMed Central?s call for
increased transparency and access to raw research data.

The open access journal, BMC Research Notes, is seeking to encourage
greater data sharing by waiving the publication fee for all articles
which use or link to open data that is prepared in line with a
community-accepted standard.

This is for immediate release.

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Best wishes,
Matt

Fantastic news!

Wonder if we should start putting news related to open data in science on a
group blog at science.okfn.org?

Currently science related news at OKF is on this list and at:

  http://blog.okfn.org/taxonomy/open-science/

Any thoughts? Anyone up for some news curation? ;-)

Apologies for interrupting the new direction of the thread, but another
piece of open data news from BMC (for those not at #solo10)

 

Our draft position statement on open data and licensing is now available

Includes a proposal that, from a specific date, any author submitting to
a BioMed Central journal would agree to dedicate the data elements of
their article and supplementary material to the public domain and apply
an open data conformant licence
<http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/> , such as Creative Commons CC0

Subject: [open-science] Brief persuasive case for data sharing?
Message-ID: <3D747121-9833-4CDF-895E-C2FD128BF91A@googlemail.com>

Dear Open Science folks, I am helping JISC prepare a FAQ on the implications of Freedom of Information and Environmental Information legislation for researchers, particularly as regards requests for their own research data. One obvious question is "Why should I make my data available?". My current (weak) answer is:

"Most research is paid for by the public, and that leads to a presumption in favour of openness. Indeed, some supporters of Open Science would make all their data publicly available as (or very soon after) they are created. [Needs link here, inc to Panton Principles I think]

"Research funders and journal editors are both beginning to set policies in favour of making data available. Usually this applies to data from completed research, or supporting findings in publications. This is part of the general idea that science (and indeed all research) should be verifiable by others.

"A presumption in favour of openness is one thing, but the Freedom of Information Acts and Environmental Information Regulations are the law in the UK (there is slightly different legislation in Scotland than in the rest of the UK, the details of which we try to cover in other answers). As always with the law, the devil lies in the detail, so the general answer to whether you need to make information available to someone else is 'it depends?' "

Can you suggest improvements to this, preferably no more than doubling its length?

There will be many more questions in the FAQ, looking at various cases where one cannot share data (privacy, ethical concerns etc), and the exemptions (or exceptions) you can try if you really don't want to share (or not yet). But this is the main place to make a case FOR sharing.

Thanks for your help,

Maybe try this:

?Publicly available data was significantly (p=0.006) associated with a
69% increase in citations, independently of journal impact factor,
date of publication, and author country of origin.? Piwowar, Heather.
?Foundational studies for measuring the impact, prevalence, and
patterns of publicly sharing biomedical research data.? Dissertation,
University of Pittsburgh, 2010.

I just popped it into a slideshow of mine. I've also seen people use
the recent NYT story about data-sharing and Alzheimer's, though it's
not quite a paradigm case because the data there weren't fully open.

Chris, you may know of this 2007 special issue of the CODATA Data
Science Journal that addresses a number of issues, rationales, and
cautions related to providing open data:

http://www.codata.org/dsj/special-open-data.html

These workshop presentations are focused on policy but also highlighted
then current data sharing efforts.

Thanks Dorothea!

That study was also published in PLoS ONE, in case you prefer a
non-dissertation citation:
http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0000308

Similar, but earlier and with a way cooler title, is Gleditsch and
Strand's "Posting Your Data: Will You Be Scooped or Will You Be Famous?"
http://www.prio.no/Research-and-Publications/Publication/?oid=55406

Chris, another argument I've often heard: publicly archive your data so that
you can find it again later, yourself :)

There's also lots to be said about "being the change you want to
see," supplemented with stats on the frequency and implications of data
withholding, etc.  Let me know if you want refs, or you can brave a mongo
list of refs on data sharing/withholding at
Mendeley<http://www.mendeley.com/research-papers/collections/3498871/Data-sharing-and-withholding/>.
 I have many relevant papers tagged with "motivation" or similar.

You might also find something useful in the latter part of these
presentations? (1<http://www.slideshare.net/hpiwowar/why-study-data-sharing-why-share-your-data>,
2<http://www.slideshare.net/hpiwowar/measuring-the-adoption-of-open-science-presentation>
)

Let me know if I can be of more help....

  Heather,

I wondered if you have found this association holding up independently 
of the number of authors?

Hi Angus,

Good question.  Unfortunately I haven't looked at that.  That study was
pretty small and so only permitted a few covariates.

fwiw, I hope to look at it in the future.  As a result of my dissertation, I
now have a dataset that contains "number of authors" and 100+ other
covariates for 11,000 publications that created gene expression microarray
data, 25% of which shared have an associated dataset in public repositories.
 I need to gather citation data for all these publications, then will have a
comprehensive look at the citation benefit.  Just need more hours in the
day.  Or a collaborator!  The dataset is publicly
available<http://github.com/hpiwowar/Piwowar-Thesis-Aim3-2010>:)

I think this is great news indeed! Of course, the data has always been
available under a CC license, but making the data available under a
public domain waiver is perfect.

Hi Heather

Thanks.. I'll get back to you on that! There is that study by Wuchty 
showing that publications from large collaborations get cited more, so 
It would be really interesting to look at whether it is a factor. I'd 
like to collaborate...though more days in the week would be useful :)

Subject: [open-science] document automation/reproducible research software
Message-ID: <113468beeb41f35280492d3a7b69ee79@localhost>

I'd like to ask the group for feedback. My new project called Dexy is
about to be launched, you can read up on it here: http://blog.dexy.it/13

It's designed to make it easier to automate research documents, both for
efficiency's sake and to facilitate open science. It's similar to Sweave
in intent, but much more comprehensive and flexible in implementation.

If anyone is interested in trying Dexy out, or wants to have a chat to
explore possibilities for using it, please let me know. I'm a few years
out
of academia, so I'd really appreciate feedback from that perspective. I'm
also on the lookout for good demo opportunities, particularly ones which
incorporate open data sets.

For now, I'd recommend people to have a working knowledge of Python for
running Dexy but the goal is for it to be readily available to researchers
with minimal programming knowledge (a web-based version is in the works
too).

Many Thanks!

Regards,
Ana

Hi Ana,

I am also interested in this problem and there is a project for web
based notebooks here: http://codenode.org/
You may want to investigate this first before developing a new web
frontend.  It has a good architecture, with pluggable engines for
execution (I have implemented R, javascript).


Good luck,
James

I've gone back to this, as my FAQ develops. The problem is, I think, that there is a significant difference between making data open once the research is published (or as part of publication), and making data either open or even available during a project, in advance of publication. FoI does bring the risk that researchers may be forced to make their data available before they have finished the research, even to their rivals. (Of course there are exemptions which may be able to be invoked in some circumstances.)

The "Open Science" approach such as Cameron Neylon advocates is closer to this, if perhaps a bit more extreme. (By this I mean that I understand Open Science to want to put all data in the open as it is gathered, rather than making some data identified by a requester available under FoI when asked.)

So is there a persuasive case for making data available during your research, before publication?

It's important to stress that the philosophy may justifiably vary
considerably between domains. My feeling is that Open Science is generally
likely to be undertaken when there is already a community of involved
scientists who are likely to be interested in the data as it comes out and
who are already adjusting to giving appropriate credit to the creator. I
think this is most likely in multidisciplinary fields, in areas where there
is a perceived benefit to the community in early release of information, or
where the data producer is, in some way, acting for the benefot of the
community. Typical examples might be the systematic collection of data
through a nationally or interantionally financed organisation.

In an area where the reward structure favours closed research competing
towards a single goal and prizes for the winner, then it's much less likely
that anyone will publish research data as it happens.

There may be an intermediate area where a scientist believes that their data
may be of interest to others in complementary fields and where the risk of
being scooped can be balanced against the benefit of enhanced scientific
discovery. In a sense this is a blind market - it's possible that it could
be developed into a market where there is active matching of people with
data to share.

If the ethos of data sharing is valued by funders then it's also possible
that there is value in publishing some data (maybe not all) or if metrics
for data re-use are developed which allow for early release then this may
also be a positive strategy.

P.

I think it is probably worth separating quite strongly the issues of how
much we publish (i.e. How much of the "research compendium" to borrow
Victoria Stodden's terminology is made available) vs when it is published. I
think it is a given that expectations are rising over how much of the
relevant material, ideas, materials, data, software, etc will be made
available. We are gradually winning that battle, which is fundamentally
about the _quality_ of publication.

The timeframe is a separate issue, and I think fighting the battles above is
made easier by punting somewhat to one side for the minute. However I think
there are both practical and philosophical arguments for publishing more
sooner.

1) It's a pain to go back and publish things. Much easier to publish them in
some form as they come out. Formal publication can then be kept for those
ideas and stories that deserve them.

2) Your interim results may be useful to others in ways that you don't
expect. This might particularly be the case e.g. for software but equally
for data and materials.

3) Finding collaborators: We have good evidence that publicly being "out
there" doing a particular piece of work can bring both academic and
commercial collaborators to the table who are willing to help. Avoiding
unneccessary replication is part of this.

4) Engagement: The attitude shift involved in putting stuff online
automatically makes you think harder about how people see it and to make
some effort to make it comprehensible. This can be low level engagement on
its own and can also lead to more direct engagement as opportunities arise
through community contributions.

5) Accessibility: This is a core argument for me. If it's accessible to all
it means its also accessible to you. This is a non-trivial argument in
favour of radical openness. Pretty much all the stuff I've lost in the last
five years involved collaborations where it wasn't possible to make things
open.

Essentially these arguments boil down to two types, the selfish and the
community minded. The argument for the selfish is:

"Well these funders are going want me to to make all of this data available
and to publish more. Putting all of this stuff out immediately both keeps
them off my back and means I don't have to put any effort into making it
available later. Plus it means I'm sure of where all my students' stuff is!"

The community minded version:

"Well science is about replication and re-use and through making things
available I make it easier to re-use. By making things available I'm
allowing anyone to do all the things I haven't thought of. This will lead to
more citations, more publications, and more collaborations to take forward
my work."

Hope that's helpful. Just off the top of my head as I try and upload some
(now _properly_ analysed) data.

Cheers

Cameron

OK I'm looking for some more help again. I'm hoping that at the very least the discipline of writing down my concern will help me understand it better, and at best you guys have a solution.

Let's imagine an institutional data repository (which I guess could be a set of different repositories). By definition, the IDR will have data that have different degrees of openness. I can distinguish at least these conditions:

a) fully open
b) closed until some condition is met (then to be open)
c) closed unless some condition is met
d) closed indefinitely.

I'm not really sure an IDR would actually want to accept data with condition (d), but there may be good reasons that escape me at the moment. But however much one would like all data to be open, there are substantial swags of data that must be temporarily or partially closed.

Independently of conditions (b) to (d), it is possible that some or all of the metadata might be open, that is to say the data might be discoverable even if not open (presumably if you found and wanted to use the data, then some sort of negotiation would have to take place).

My question is: how could constraints like these sensibly be expressed, in either a human-readable or (better) machine-readable way?

I think its a struggle to present these in an easily readable way because
the conditions for b) and c) can differ so much. So while the impulse
towards a Creative Commons style iconography that is easy to read and easy
to code up in machine readable form is understandable we've got some way to
go before those conditions can be easily codified. Then of course there is
the whole argument over licences vs technical measures vs norms for
"controlling" access. I presume that technical measures would be the case
here.

Its reasonably easy at least to designate the fully open case, use ccZero or
PDDL and these have machine codings as well. There is certainly some value
in standardising embargo language and markup for case b). To say that "this
will be available under X licence/waiver on date Y". But c) is a real mess
and will probably be case by case for the forseeable future until we get a
real handle on what kind of conditions are workable and needed in practice.

Cheers

Cameron

I don't think that there is agreement on how to do b+c even for humans. What
is the condition? Is  like "a paper getting published" - humans will
squabble about what this means so it's impossible for machines.

We have a JISC project CLARION which is managing data embargoes and at
present there is no alternative to humans pressing buttons.

The only simple procedures are a and d. The only normally desirable one is a

Chris,

See the Geospatial Digital Rights Management Reference Model for (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/as/geodrmrm 
).
Here's a magazine article about GeoDRM: http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=28323 
  .

I think the basic principles you seek to understand are in the GeoDRM,  
though the focus is on geospatial data. Geospatial data are  
particularly complex -- for example, there is frequently a need to  
track the rights information about different data "layers" that have  
been used to create a composite data layer.  So if this reference  
model can be applied to geospatial data, I think it is likely it can  
be adapted easily enough to work with other kinds of data.

Whether an individual IDR would want to deal with data sets that are
constrained to various degrees -- "varied constraint" is certainly
the condition of corpus of data relevant to many key scientific problems?

This discussion brought to mind the Bose and Frew article from 2005 --
"Lineage retrieval for scientific data processing: a survey"
[SEE: http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1057978 ] (and a companion PPT
"  Tracking Metadata and Lineage of the Data Processing Chain for Mapping
Snow Cover Properties with the NASA MODIS" [SEE: http://tiny.cc/xpe37 ]* )
*
It seems to me that the terms of access for data are logically a subset of
the full description of data and lineage...? And that what we're after are
descriptive capacity to represent "terms of embargo as well as less precise
forms of constraint?"

"Could further action towards opening up public data resources and practical measures facilitating re-use (asset lists of available documents, simplified or no licensing conditions, marginal costs etc.) contribute to unlocking innovation and developing new services, applications and mash-ups?"

"Community-wide products and services using PSI are not limited to national borders. Do you think that divergent national rules can make it more complicated to grasp economic opportunities and to develop cross-border products and services?"

"Currently, the PSI Directive is not applicable to information held by cultural, educational and research establishments and public service broadcasters.

[educational and research establishments? cultural establishments? public service broadcasters?]"

"Do you think that all public sector information which is already publicly accessible should also be re-usable?"

"In your opinion, should more re-use friendly formats (e.g. machine readable) be promoted?"

"In your opinion, public sector information should be made available for re-use..." [under various cost/charging models]

"Do you think that the current rules on charging (allowing full cost recovery, together with a reasonable return on investment) should be tightened and/or clarified in respect of how much re-users can be charged?"

"Should the Commission promote practical measures such as national portals (like the www.data.gov.uk or the www.data.gov in the US) with a strong political drive towards opening up the wealth of public sector data?"

Subject: [open-science] Planning to publish your data could keep FoI
	requests from your door!
Message-ID: <DBAF9EC4-78A7-4143-90BB-81CC161A8195@googlemail.com>

I've been asking the FoI list about FoI exemptions for research data in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (Scotland has a useful exemption). I tried this by means of a scenario that I'll repeat here:

"Let's suppose we have a research group working at the University of Pippleton in England on a publicly-funded research project. Their work does not involve environmental information, so EIR does not come into it. Let's say their work is in the highly competitive prateomics field, so there are no privacy or medical ethics issues involved. They are aware that there are several competing groups in other universities working on related lines of enquiry. In fact, there's a bit of a race on to see who can assemble enough data to write a potentially highly prestigious paper.

One day our researchers in Pippleton receive a request from their competitors in the University of Lunchester asking for all the data they have assembled on the XYZ problem: precisely the area that the Pippleton folk have been working on. They've heard a rumour that Lunchester has fallen a bit behind in its data gathering, so it looks as if they are trying to use FoI to steal a march on Pippleton. If Pippleton can refuse the FoI request, then they have a chance to win; if they have to release the data, then Lunchester can combine it with their own, and they will win.

Pippleton clearly wants to refuse the request. However, they had no plans to release the XYZ problem data itself, merely a few subsets of it to illustrate the article they were planning. The information isn't available anywhere else. There's no external confidentiality preventing release. The Principal Investigator thinks he might go mad if he has to release it, but they can hardly go for a Health and Safety exemption on those grounds. There's no personal information.

If Pippleton were in Scotland, then FoISA S27(b) would probably do the trick, but I'm concerned at this moment about the rest of the UK.

The only exemption that I can see that might apply is FoIA S43: Commercial interests... Can it apply?"

There was some contrary opinions among the list members on whether commercial interests could be applied; the "highly competitive" phrase convinced one that it could, while others were not so sanguine.

But the response I thought particularly interesting was from Ganesh:

"Perhaps Pippleton should formulate a policy of publishing their raw data once certain criteria are met - e.g. all papers relating to it are published and there's no expectation of writing more. Too late for this request, but it would mean s22 could potentially protect them in future, though of course it might ultimately fail on the public interest arguments."

So, it's possible that Open Data could help prevent your research being scooped prior to publication!

Subject: [open-science] Open Computational Chemistry Knowledgebase
Message-ID: <AANLkTin74uwJumKJaKJqXBvfA_FW=sv9FAkM-a6xiqap@mail.gmail.com>

I have just attended a meeting on Databases in QuantumChemistry (
http://neptuno.unizar.es/events/qcdatabases2010/program.html ) and we have
decided to create an Open knowledgebase of the results of Quantum Chemical
calculations. I have opened an Etherpad at:
http://okfnpad.org/zcam2010
It's likely to be fairly specialised but anyone is welcome to help. The idea
is to create a major Open resource of calculations which may be inlcuded in
the world's Linked Open data for chemistry.

More details in the pad.

This is not an official OKF project but it will use the OKD Panton
Principles  and I thought the Pad was a great technology for the group to
use. The data themselves would probably be at Cambridge Unilever Centre but
the metadata can be in CKAN.

Early days.
