Example when the law overrides Openness...

Does OKF offer a freer alternative than US sites? Are we subject to legal
restrictions?

Hello SourceForge project administrator,

SourceForge has project settings to help you comply with regulations
governing distribution of software to persons from certain countries
(aka Export Controls).  We've had some recent questions about these
settings, so have sent out this note to all administrators to make
sure all projects have this information.

By default, software downloads initiated by visitors from Sudan, North
Korea, Syria, Iran and Cuba are blocked.

A project administrator may disable this blocking if they conclude
that their project is *not* subject to US export-related regulations
or any prohibitions of applicable jurisdictions:
1. Project Admin -> Project Settings.
2. Find the "Export Control" section.
3. Tick the first radio button under "Export Control" and click "Update".

We at SourceForge are committed to the ideals of free and open source
software, including the principle of free exchange of information. Our
approach to access control is intended to empower you and reward your
continued trust.  We recognize, however, that our approach isn't the
completely free access to everything for everyone that some would
like.  As a US-based web site, SourceForge is committed to complying
fully with US laws and regulations, including those affecting the
distribution of software.  We will continue to work as diligently as
possible to ensure that our legal compliance is coupled with the
highest quality of service that we can offer to our diverse, global
user base.

Best regards,

Daniel Hinojosa
Sr. Manager, SourceForge.net Support

Subject: [open-science] Press release: BibApp 1.0 released
Message-ID: <AANLkTinZ3N7eQAWsS1s9C9FfgbWZc8dhIsjO9xybtCX6@mail.gmail.com>

(This message is being sent to multiple lists; please excuse duplication.)


The BibApp development team is happy and proud to announce the 1.0
release of BibApp!

BibApp is a campus research gateway and expert finder. It matches
researchers on your campus or research center with their publication
data and mines that data to see collaborations, create visualizations
of areas of research, and find experts in research areas. With BibApp,
it is easy to see what publications can be placed on the Web for
greater access and impact. BibApp can push those publications directly
into an institutional repository.

BibApp allows researchers and research groups to promote research,
find collaborators on campus, and make research more accessible. It
also allows libraries to better understand research happening in local
departments, facilitate conversations about author rights with
researchers, and ease the population of the institutional repository.
Finally, BibApp allows campus administrators to achieve a clearer
picture of collaboration and scholarly publishing trends on campus.

BibApp is the result of a collaboration between the University of
Wisconsin-Madison and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
The Illinois Informatics Institute at the University of Illinois
(https://www.informatics.illinois.edu/icubed/) provided generous
funding for the development of the 1.0 release of BibApp.

BibApp is a Ruby on Rails application, coupled with the Solr/Lucene
search engine, and either MySQL or PostgreSQL as its datastore. It
uses open standards and protocols such as OpenURL and SWORD and
automatically pulls in data from third party sources such as Google
Books and the Sherpa/Romeo publisher policy database. BibApp imports
publication data in RIS, MEDLINE and Refworks XML bibliography formats
and exports data in several citation formats (APA, Chicago, IEEE, MLA,
more) via CiteProc. BibApp also provides a web services API for
delivering data as XML, YML, JSON, and RDF. BibApp is released under a
University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License
(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/UoI-NCSA.php).

Live installations of BibApp can be found at:

    * University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign --
http://connections.ideals.illinois.edu
    * The MBLWHOI Library at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution --
http://bibapp.mbl.edu/
    * The University of Kansas Medical Center -- http://experts.kumc.edu/

Next steps for the project include a 1.1 release that will include
internationalization and a richer authentication/authorization system.
The team is also in the process of expanding the development community
around BibApp.

For software downloads, contact information, and more information
about BibApp, please visit http://www.bibapp.org/, and also follow on
Twitter at http://twitter.com/bibapp.

This actually something someone else recently mentioned to me. From
the OKF end, people could run their own KForge
(http://www.kforgeproject.com/) instance to host their projects or use
the service we run at http://knowledgeforge.net -- though we're
probably not geared to provide the capacity of something like
sourceforge ...

I wonder if there are enough of us that care about this, to gather
some support for developing kforge further as a competitor to the
likes of google code and github?

See you,

I can see this becoming a bigger issue in two areas - there are those who
want to localise data/code in either the US or Europe to avoid specific
regulations in both places (patriot act, database rights, privacy
protections) as well as issues like this where the issue is export. So such
things would certainly be valuable. Amazon have European localised services
for this reason.

Question is whether setting up an alternate is better/more cost effective
than working with existing players to set up European instances?

Cheers

Cameron

Message-ID: <AANLkTilR9FrCvG1f3cSQ5Rt1lXDwlUswdIRY0eQNz851@mail.gmail.com>

I am honoured to have been asked to talk at the Open Science Summit in
Berkeley at the end of this month:
http://opensciencesummit.com/schedule/
Berkeley is the home of the
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Speech_Movement
and is an icon for us - it's my first time there and I'm really excited.

I have chosen to call my talk "The Open Knowledge Foundation" as I truly
believe that the OKF is a major force in Openness and will continue to grow
rapidly. I have 10 minutes (perhaps 11). I don't want to give a corporate
overview - I want to give the idea that the OKF is a cauldron of ideas which
become instantiated in real projects.

One idea I'd like to try is "10 ways we can all change the world". This
could include CKAN, Opendata buttons, Panton,  IsItOpen, Open
Bibliobiography. etc. 5 might be better -

But I'm open to any suggestions.

P.

Hi all,

I wonder whether anyone from this group might be willing to help
review a short piece on pollen data written by Stefano Costa
(coordinator for our working group on open data in archaeology) to be
cross posted on the OKF blog?

Details below...

All the best,

The 10 ideas for opening up scientific data is a great idea. Perhaps
we could start a pad to iterate on this?

5 ideas for starters:

  * Data: Open up your research data in accordance with the Panton Principles.
  * Publications: Deposit your publications in an open access
repository -- or publish in open access journal. Ideally under an open
license (such as Creative Commons Attribution).
  * Code: Make software available under an open source license.
  * Process: Let others know what you're doing: whether via a blog,
public mailing lists, or social networking sites.
  * Advocacy: Encourage students, researchers and colleagues to do the same!

All the best,

Jonathan

We should also have very simple things people can do - like adding open data

That would be great. Think its crucial to have *very* clear criteria
for the petals -- so binary Y/N question is easy to answer (e.g. PP
compliant? OSI compliant? 'Libre' OA? ...)

I like this idea a lot. Could I make a suggestion that the fifth one, rather
than being advocacy should be to make physical materials available? Creative
Commons have done a lot of work recently on generic MTAs in an effort to
make sharing physical materials as easy and consistent as data and code.
Advocacy for me is the centre of the flower and the five petals Open Data,
Open access papers/communication, Open Code, Open process, Open Materials.

I am giving a similar 10 minutes at the summit (I think on the same panel as
Peter?) and was intending to focus on process as the area that has received
the least work and has the weakest framework to build on in my view.

So for instance we can say as criteria:

Data -> PP
OA -> SPARC OA Seal, CC-BY
Code -> OSI compliant
Materials -> CC-MTA (actually I'm unsure what level should be recommended
here)

Process -> ? We don't really have equivalents beyond Jean-Claude's
delayed/non-delayed and full record/partial record ONS claims

Cheers

There is a lot of undercurrent at the moment about what I'll call Open
Methodology. Give use not only your data but what you did with it. That's
hard. A lot of people don't realise how technically hard that is. We are
trying to address this in Open Bibliography.

Not to spoil the 5 petals idea, but there is also what I've taken to 
calling open community --- the idea that science can potentially benefit 
from the input of people who traditionally would be called non-scientists. 
The Galaxy Zoo project is an outstanding example.

I certainly agree that advocacy is the core --- the fundamental task of 
open science, in my opinion, is changing the hearts and minds of the 
scientific community about the best ways of doing science.  If that can be 
achieved, then all else will follow.

Cheers,

Michael

Slightly OT, but I think codenode is on the right wavelength here:
http://codenode.org/
The idea is that you can have data analysis notebooks, saved online
and sharable (and cloneable).

I added an R and javascript engine (so you can code in those
languages) recently so I can confirm the architecture is pretty good.
What it needs is a focus on data and library integration, and some
frontend work.  Perhaps picking a topic (climate change?) and
developing notebooks for that is the way to go.

Cheers,
James

didn't want to hijack the other thread so i changed the subject line, but
i'm curious (and perhaps this is a naive question):

what open access repositories are there which people recommend, besides,
say, arxiv.org? arxiv.org itself doesn't seem to have a strong (or at least
not explicit) stance on licenses and such. and are there any OA archives
where people can submit their code/data along with their paper (in such a
way that it is formally associated with that paper?)

Hi Jessy,

One answer:

Dryad <http://www.datadryad.org/> is a relatively new repository, focused
right now on data behind papers published in Ecology and Evolution.  It
doesn't accept code at the moment, but likely will in the future.

Dryad is a neat model:  it is trying very hard to get long-term
sustainability figured out at the beginning, is working very
closely<http://www.datadryad.org/jdap>with journal editors and
publishers, clearly
states <http://www.datadryad.org/depositing> the data is CC0, and cares
about getting data citations right (data DOIs<http://www.datadryad.org/using>
).

says the new Dryad postdoc ;)

It's probably useful to differentiate between code/data/documents. The
current usage is:

open access - papers
open source - code
open data     - data

OpenSource is usually stored in specialist software repositories, which
should have  a powerful versioning system (SVN or better Mercurial or Git).
Typical repos are Sourceforge and bitbucket. These repos *could* be used for
otehr material (such as data or documentation but this is probably not a
good idea technically, as there is no good text search facility, etc)

OpenAccess material is usually stored in paper-oriented repos (DSPace,
Eprints, Fedora) and are commonly found in Universities and similar insts
and run by LIS staff. They are totally unsuited to software and data (go on,
someone, ask me why!)

OpenData is relatively new. The problems of storing it are considerable and
largely unsolved. Problems include versioning, dynamic updating, metadata,
formats, lack of specialist knowledge (there are (tens of) thousands of
common formats (e.g. several hundred alone in chemistry). This is my
speciality and I don't know the answer. I suspect it will be domain-specific
(e.g. biosequences, etc, are well supported at present, chemistry has
possiblle solutions but there are rabid anticommons interests in chemistry,
particle physics is huge, climate is hyperpolitical, etc.) OKF is as good a
place to start as any (though we can't store huge datasets and are more
likely to address metadata).

I've been carrying this around in my backpack for a while now and
reading in bits and pieces on the train etc.  Well worth the effort.

For a paper about open issues in a legal framework it is surprising that
there is no explicit statement of licensing or rights in the paper or its
splash page. The only licence is
http://www.ssrn.com/dmca_notice_policy.html
which invokes the DMC Act and appears to be "if you infringe go to jail".

It is exactly this sort of lack of clarity that we have to address. It's
quite clear that Universities don't generally know/care and University
repositories are stuffed full of "burn in hell" copyright clauses. This is a
tragedy for theses and I am going to propose to OKF that we develop an Open
Thesis project.

Do I post this on okfn-discuss?

If you really want to overload the analogy I would see this as the
complement of advocacy, returning back to the centre from the 'outside'. The
sun providing the energy for the whole process.

What you're describing is an attitude, an openess even, to ideas and
contributions regardless of their source. It's not just community, or amazon
turk style clicking, building forums, or valuing research done by
non-professionals, but also funding of different types.

I'd still see this consistent with the 'petals' as defined and measurable
activities, and the "core" and the "outside/sun" representing attitudes that
as you say will drive the adoption and development of the activities...

I think this discussion is getting to the core of what the OKF is about. I'm
keen that we address "advocacy"

There is undoubtedly an element of advocacy in the OKF and there should be.
I talked abou this with Rufus and Jonathan 2-3 weeks ago and their view was
that OKF stopped short of campaigning - such as the Open Rights Group. I'd
agree. I've recently been involved in protracted closed discussion by a
group who wanted to see the OKF as a campaigning lobbying force and I
resisted this.

By own feeling is that we should primarily practice advocacy through our
works. IOW we should create tools and materials that through their own force
liberate. Thus rather than lobbying politicians for Open data we create
viral approaches such as buttons and IsItOpen.

Rufus and I have recently won research funding from JISC (#jiscobib) where
the OKF was central and where (I think) its objectivity was a major asset. I
can see the time when there is a greater role for campaigning but at the
moment I'd suggest something like:
"advocacy through our works" - the works rather than the people are the
advocates. GalaxyZoo and Open Streetmap are examples of this.

For example: my university mentioned creative commons when they were telling
us about the etheses system (see http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/ ), but
described it as a way to give your work "more protection" than copyright.
Looking at a few recent etheses, they seem to use a standard boilerplate:

*This electronic thesis is protected by the Copyright, Designs and Patents
Act 1988.
No reproduction is permitted without consent of the author. It is also
protected by
the Creative Commons Licence allowing Attributions-Non-commercial-No
derivatives.

*That strikes me as being self contradictory: the creative commons license
exists precisely to permit reproduction without the consent of the author.
Am I right in thinking that the Noderivs license also means that the thesis
can only be reused in its entirety?

Maybe we should think about how to get the universities up to speed with
this, before etheses are old enough that they think "this is how we've
always done it".

I am now firmly convinced that the OKF should have an Open Thesis project.
We can, must, and will liberate theses from this. NC-ND is totally
inappropraite IMO for an academic work.

I note that theses are comprehensively downloaded by Google. I have done a
snap test in retrieveing sentences from a thesis and have observed that
every single sentence is indexed by Google and redisplayed in context (i.e.
Google have all the paragraphs, etc.)

So my simple question is what gives Google the right to do this and why are
we not allowed to do it? Or do Google simply ignore copyright on any
documents found openly exposed on the Internet?

If Google does this with impunity and ig no authors or repositories complain
then I would think we have a very strong moral right (if not precise legal
right) to do the same. Trademarks can lapse if they are not defended.
Although I assume this is not true for copyright  (i.e. repeated multiple
violations without action do not constitute a formal defence) I would see
that in academia it is effectively defensible.

So Open Thesis - should I propose it on okfn-discuss?

I agree with what you say about the importance of attitude, but I think 
open community is about more than just attitude.  There's a well-defined 
question that can be asked of any scientific project: does the project 
offer substantive ways for non-professionals to contribute to the science, 
and encourage that involvement?

The answer to this question is, of course, no, for nearly all scientific 
projects.  Even for many open science projects the answer is no.  For 
example, the Cornell arXiv erects considerable barriers to contributions 
by people who aren't academics or have a close association with academics. 
Those barriers aren't insurmountable, but they're there. By contrast, 
projects such as Galaxy Zoo, the open dinosaur project, and even the 
Polymath Project all quite explicitly offer realistic and substantive ways 
for non-professionals to contribute.

This made me realise something. For each of these "petals", publication,
code, data, etc. I now just _assume_ that two way communication is a given.
So making code available on a recognised repo presumes that you are open to
receiving external patches, publishing a paper means that you will receive
commentary...I mean why else would you bother? I realise this is probably
not a widely held set of assumptions :-)

So I see a difference between the technical capacity which I am essentially
assuming is built in as we migrate more activity in a substantive way on the
web vs the attitude towards actually listening to the return path.

I still feel the attitudinal change is the hard thing, and also the hard one
to measure. Galaxy Zoo could have forums but not have any of the scientists
actually listening to them. ArXiv could be more open to contributions from
non-professionals, its just a matter of attitude.

Of course, as you point out, most projects have no technical return path at
all and that is something that is measurable. What sort of standards and
expectations would be appropriate to build in there? What is appropriate for
different kinds of projects (with different issues around
privacy/security/time availability?). Is there a minimal standard?

Cheers
Cameron

In many, perhaps most cases a cleaned up version of my question is, I 
think, clear enough: does the project (1) offer substantive ways for 
non-professionals to contribute to the science, and also (2) encourage 
that involvement?

For most scientific projects the answer is a clear "no".  For arXiv the 
answer is also "no".  For Galaxy Zoo etc the answer is a clear "yes". I'd 
be interested if anyone knows offhand what the policies for deposition are 
at places like GenBank.  I wouldn't be surprised if the big databases are 
all over the place on this issue, with the answer often being that (1) is 
possible in principle, but that the answer to part (2) is "no".  So they 
don't satisfy the criterion.

I'm not sure I see the relevance of privacy / security / time availability 
on this particular question.  Of course, I agree that such issues exist 
and are important, e.g., privacy issues at a site like PatientsLikeMe. 
But they seem orthogonal to the issue of whether there's a serious two-way 
engagement going on with amateurs having the opportunity to make a 
substantive contribution.

In terms of measurement it is better to describe the kind of behavior we
want from each other in terms of open, multi-way communications, and
look for ways of measuring that. In some sense it is irrelevant what my
attitude is, as long as I behave in acceptable ways.

What metrics can we use to measure "encourage involvement"? This has two
parts to be measured; viz., "encouragement" and "involvement". What are
the properties of "involvement" that can be automatically measured?

If Galazy Zoo is a clear "yes"; then how is that answer determined? Can
it be determined automatically, or can part of that answer be determined
automatically? [I believe so.] Is there a necessary subjective
evaluation needed?

An answer to how Galaxy Zoo gets a "yes" and arXiv a "no" is the basis
for establishing criteria for other projects.

Issues about the properties, standards and expectations of 'involvement'

openness (as in the open knowledge defnition) and the standards and 
expectations that operate in fields with a tradition of participatory 
research, e.g. in health and social sciences. The questions I have 
(please excuse their length) are about:

- The principle of "mutual ownership" of the processes and products of 
the research enterprise. I don't think this necessarily translates to 
these being in the public domain - for example collaborative research 
between academic and user partners is often based on agreements to share 
IP and access rights, at least for a period. I acknowledge some on this 
list would not support that, and my point is that mutual ownership 
logically excludes proprietary ownership by the academic 'lead partner'. 
Does citizen science? My question on this is prompted by some recent 
interviews with researchers on open working in their field- one view was 
that citizen science is primarily about reducing research costs or 
making certain tasks doable with volunteer effort, and is an orthogonal 
issue to ownership of the results. Have any principles of citizen 
science been articulated that do tie involvement to mutual ownership - 
in the moral if not legal sense? If so do they include attribution of 
effort?

- The principle of "informed consent" strongly influences not only 
privacy legislation but also the ethical obligation in human subjects 
research to seek permission for data re-use, whenever this departs from 
the original purpose the data was collected/created for. I know of some 
work on 'open consent' in the area of genomics research, where the 
principle has been challenged by the 'long term public good' argument, 
and the point that genetic data is in any case shared with ones blood 
relatives, so individual consent breaks down. The open consent model 
asks volunteers to acknowledge that the purposes 'their' data may be 
reused for cannot be foreseen. However volunteers retain the right to 
withdraw their consent for further uses of the data at any time. This 
gives citizens/volunteers an informed decision about whether to give up 
some privacy right for a promised public good. Considering the extension 
of open data principles to human subjects data, how is this consistent 
with a right to withdraw consent to data re-use?

It seems to be the key point underlying both of these questions is that 
'involvement' or 'participation' suggests an ongoing relationship 
governed by principles of mutual consent and a shared stake in ownership 
among members of a community - whether defined by contract or social 
norms - but are contrary to the principle of openness to the extent that 
'open' means absence of any restriction or conditions on reuse.

Grateful for thoughts on this or any pointers to discussion elsewhere. I 
should point out I'm writing up results of the interviews I mentioned 
for an article, and will acknowledge any comments I get.

Of course, at the same time, Galaxy Zoo is not producing *open* data
if I recall rightly:

<http://ckan.net/package/galaxyzoo>

I think this may be because of the source of the images they use.

thanks peter.

as a start, i wonder if something could be put together that was essentially
a mashup of github (code), infochimps (data), and a file server for papers.
all wrapped with a choice of OA/FOSS etc. licenses to choose from.

it probably wouldn't scale indefinitely as a solution, but having a place
for people to go would be a good start in terms of increasing awareness of
this as an option, and demand for those kinds of services.

thoughts?

I'm inclined to suggest that a topic map be put in place that
federates the heterogeneous resources mentioned here. Not only does it
capture the metadata about each resource (which includes such things
as download locations, licenses, etc), but it also allows people to
wire relations among those resources, enhancing the findability. Done
properly, a topic map can include something called issue maps which
are structured conversations held online about issues related to those
resources (as compared to email lists).

As a thought, topic maps are *maps*, not *territory*. Scalability
issues should not be the same or even similar to those associated with
one central repository. Of course, there are likely other issues, but
I suspect they are perhaps more tame.

Continuing the 5 petals idea there are some nice Wikipedia images for the
Roses of York and
Lancaster .
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose_of_York
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Rose_of_Lancaster

the petals could be red or white according to whether the person had created
an Open offering in that area. Altogether there will be
5R + 5*(4R1W) + 10*(3R2W) + 10*(2R3W) + 5*(1R4W) + 5W

a total of 32 Roses. These could be prepared on an OKF site - they would
look very pretty and people could download the appropriate ones. I suggest
they have single capital letters on each petal for mnemonic purposes.

They would make nice badges at meetings - you get a red  rose sticker and
peel off the petals you had achieved. Good things to talk about.

If we agree I could mock one up for Berkeley. Then during the talk I could
peel off one petal for each achieved item.

Apologies for any cross-posts
------------------------------------------


Dear colleague,

the ICA Commission on Management and Economics of Map Production is 
organizing a Workshop on Management of Geographic Information and Map 
Production on the 19th of November in conjunction with AutoCarto 2010 
(15-18th November - Orlando, Florida, USA). The topics which are 
considered during this workshop are:
?       Dataware, the use of open data in different applications in GI and 
map production, including also aspects of crowd sourcing;
?       Standardization, especially for the formal description of 
production lines ;
?       Value chain of GI.

The commission is also working on a book with the working title ?GI and 
Map Production Management? in which the topics mentioned above among 
others (e.g. quality control and models of management in GI) will be 
addressed. The presentations and discussion during the workshop will form 
an ideal opportunity to exchange ideas about these topics and construct a 
basis for the planned book.

If you are interested in attending the workshop, preparing a presentation 
for the workshop and/or contributing to the book, please mail to 
info at icamapproduction.org. 
The deadline for these contributions is on the 30th of September.

My notes are at
http://friendfeed.com/danielmietchen/c1d82ee7/digitization-of-science-and-degradation
.
She mentions an NSF report due to come out this month in which
guidelines for reproducible research in computing are included.
Guess that one could provide an interesting angle for Peter's OSS
talk. Couldn't find it yet, though.

There might also be something useful in the papers/presentations at the NSF workshop on archiving experiments that I attended a few weeks ago --

Hmm.. in that case perhaps we should start an official PP translation drive!

Would anyone on this list be interested in becoming an administrator
for the PP site to help with this kind of thing? It uses WP, and
imagine that active site maintenance wouldn't take more than a couple
of hours per month! ;-)

All the best,

This may be of interest to scientists who wish to explore Open Science and
scientific data.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

*DISCIPLINE HOPPING: ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL SCIENCES*

*DEADLINE: **4 pm 16 September 2010*

The Cross-Disciplinary Interfaces Programme (C-DIP) aims to enable UK
engineers and physical scientists to be world-leading in research and
training at existing and emerging cross-disciplinary interfaces. C-DIP
wishes to support Discipline Hopping grants between the engineering and
physical sciences and economic and social sciences interfaces.  Applications
are invited from established researchers from across the disciplines who
wish to explore a new research area and are passionate about
cross-disciplinary working.
Up to ?1 million has been earmarked for this targeted activity and, subject
to the quality of the submissions received, approximately 10 proposals will
be funded.

*SCOPE*: The C-DIP Discipline Hopping Grant enables established researchers
in the engineering or physical sciences to apply for funding to investigate
and develop ideas, skills and collaborations in economic and social science
research.  Also, established economic and social science researchers can
apply for funding to develop ideas, skills and collaborations with physical
scientists or engineers.

Discipline Hopping Grants are not intended to support fully formed research
proposals or interdisciplinary training programmes.  The aim is to promote
future collaborations and larger-scale interdisciplinary research through
the scheme, and it is not expected that a Discipline Hopping Grant will
necessarily lead to publications or to specific objectives being met within
its duration.

*ELIGIBILITY*: For information on the eligibility of organisations and
individuals to receive EPSRC funding, see the EPSRC Funding Guide: *
http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/apprev/basics/Pages/fundingguide.aspx*<http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/apprev/basics/Pages/fundingguide.aspx>.
As this call is a targeted funding opportunity provided by EPSRC, higher
education institutions, research council institutes and independent research
organisations are eligible to apply. It is required that the principal
investigators themselves carry out the discipline hop.

*FUNDING*: Grants can last from three months to a year; funding may be
awarded for:

   - Salary support to enable applicants to be released from
   teaching/administrative/other duties in order to personally develop the
   interdisciplinary activities.
   - Consumables, equipment and travel that are necessary for developing the
   interdisciplinary activity.
   - Focused workshops to enhance networking between disciplines.


*APPLICATION PROCEDURE*: Candidates should prepare and submit proposals
using Je-S (*https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/* <https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/>).  EPSRC
must receive applications by *16:00 on 16 September 2010*.  Please note that
a letter required from the research organisation/department/company which
the candidate is hopping into confirming they agree to be a host, and also a
letter from the Head of Department of the applicant?s department confirming
that they agree to the discipline hop and that where applicable, appropriate
arrangements are in place for the management of current research grants held
by the applicant during his/her Discipline Hopping award.

*CONTACT*: Miss Samantha Madden, Cross-Disciplinary Research Portfolio
Manager, tel 01793 44 4463, email
*Samantha.Madden at epsrc.ac.uk*<Samantha.Madden at epsrc.ac.uk>

She replied to my inquiry, stating that the date of release of the
report has been shifted by a few months.

This is interesting:

I've been looking into this since at least 2007 [1], and have had
positive feedback from various folks at the IPCC in the past about
making their material (in particular DDC) more open.

That would be fantastic Fabiana! Perhaps you could email a URL here

E.g. Ignasi: would you be willing to proof read a Spanish translation

interesting development. one point this article raises is the question of
how requirements for release might impact longitudinal studies, and in
general makes me wonder, when does something become FoI/FOIA-able? when it's
pencil marks in a notebook? when the file has been saved? when a
statistically significant number of observations have been made?

or put another way, thinking more about sharing that hostile release, when
is a data set complete enough to share? when does a set of observations
become a data set? are there ways to dictate "in progress" or even "stream
data"?

one of the biggest arguments against data sharing in science is that those
who haven't been intimately involved with the project "wouldn't get it".
this seems like a misnomer to me, since lack of availability/exposure to raw
data only exacerbates our lack of literacy with it. but especially with
charged issues like climate change it's easy to see how sharing can
backfire.

so maybe it all comes back to better ways of annotating data.

anyway, bit of a rhetorical rant i guess, but worth thinking about.

Re:

I think it all comes down to science funders requiring metadata, and  
requiring metadata that conforms to standards. Each discipline's data  
coordination body, coordinating with other data coordinating bodies,  
needs to look at ISO metadata standards, open source and proprietary  
metadata tools, standards for encoding data and standards for  
interfaces on software that produces or ingests data.

For geospatial data, for example, there are the ISO 19115 and ISO  
19119 metadata standards and OGC standards, including the OGC  
("OpenGIS") Observations and Measurements Encoding Standard (O&M) (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om 
) .

In a Web services world, we will discover that the distinction betwee  
"data files" and "metadata files" is an artifact of primitive 20th  
century computer technology. There should be no distinction between  
these, other than distinctions for the parts of a record, such as we  
have for books: front cover and title, copyright page, title page,  
table of contents, dedication page and acknowledgments, preface,  
introduction, body, footnotes, index, glossary, back cover.  Is such a  
structure too complex for today's digital science documents?

Speak up and be bold, data curators, and coordinate like our planetary  
lease depended on it!

I have a 'working document' on google docs where I am doing the
tranlation. Should I invite specific peole or should I just make it
comlpetely open for viewin/editing? Not sure what is best....

I shall be giving a 10-minute talk about the OKF at the Berkeley Open
Science Summit in 10 days time. It would be great to be able to announce
translations of the PP.

I think this is a real opportunity for the OKF - although it will be a lot
of hard work.

"Open Data" is now hitting us from every side. Five years ago the term was
unknown. Many of the people who are arguing for Open Data (e.g. the THES
article, Climategate, etc.) think Open Data is trivial matter of pressing a
button and exposing your nicely ordered, recomputable data. Refusal to do so
means you are selfish and uncooperative.

It's not like that. Data are messy, sprawling, incompletely understood. They
are often created or gathered by people who don't understand data. In our
own department many people have "lost data". This isn't because they are
deliberately irresponsible (they aren't) but because the infrastructure
(technical and cultural) isn't there.

I have been trying to aspire to Open Notebook Science in computational
chemistry - where all the data are exposed at the time of calculation. It's
very difficult technically. The first time I tried it I failed. I'm trying
to work towards Reproducible Computational Chemistry. I am some way away
(though making progress).

Data processing is almost inevitable. In many projects it goes somethinig
like:
RawData => CleanedData => FilteredData
The raw data usually comes from an instrument. It's almost never absolute.
It needs adjusting for calibration, for noise and many other common
artefacts. This is not "munging the data to fit the theory", it is trying to
create an abstraction which is independent of the particular experimental
setup.

Then it needs filtering. A typical example is recognising significant
effects and separating these from noise. Of course noise is *sometimes* a
new scientific effect - e.g. pulsars - but most of the time it is
unexplained noise. We trust the domain expert to clean and filter the data.

This takes time. There's little (IMO) to be gained by exposing this, any
more than the calibration of microscopes and balances. I'm personally happy
for it to be expopsed, but not to find the time and resources to do it.

So I think the OKF is in a unique position to bring clarity and neutrality
into this. One way might be to have Panton discussions on this - with a
range of points of view. Another would be to see OKF white-papers on the
realistic and unrealistic expectations of exposing data. If these were
compelling then they could inform decision-making by funders, publishers,
etc. I liked Chris Rusbridge's comment on the FOI-isation of data. We have
to have some perspective. There has to be a timegap between conception and
exposure, just as there has to be for most other information under FOI. And
I think we'd all agree FOI is a very blunt instrument.

In summary "Data Is Difficult". The OKF is well positioned to outline those
difficulties cartefully and neutrally and provide guidelines for addressing
them

Hi all,

I just extracted about 3.3M SMILES strings (chemical line notation)
from PubChem for a subset of structures I need to algorithm
validation. Of course, I'd like to share this data set Openly, as I
know at least one other person who is interested in it, and we would
like to compare results...

So, I went over to "Is it Open Data" [0]. But browsing the queries, I
note that many are actually unanswered since the post in 2009... what
is the workflow here with respect to following up on queries?

Otherwise, it would be nice if people could express their interest in
a resolution for that particular query... sort of voting, so to say.
For example, I quite like the queries about the data in Chemistry
Central and J. Chem. Inf.

This service was created by OKF volunteers who are to be congratulated. The
challenge now is to get a critical mass of usage on the service so that we
get confidence in its value. The more questions that are asked the more
convincing. Note, of course, that no-one is required to reply (unlilke
WhatDoTheyKnow.com where the FOI law requires a reply). So please use it -
it's up to us to make it work.

But that still does not tell me how I can contribute on open
queries... should I contact to original person who made the query, to
ask about the state of that query? Or should I, instead, repeat the
query with the provider myself? How would I link the two (identical)
queries then?

Peter,

Thank you for your reply. It's certainly true in the geospatial world  
that "data is difficult".

I would be very interested to know what you think of the OGC  
Observations and Measurements Encoding Standard (http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/om 
  ). It defines an abstract model and an XML schema [www.w3.org/XML/Schema 
] encoding for observations and it provides support for common  
sampling strategies. O&M also provides a general framework for systems  
that deal in technical measurements in science and engineering. This  
is one of the OGC Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) [http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/markets-technologies/swe 
] suite of standards, which have applicability outside the geospatial  
domain.

I am a writer and promoter of ideas, not a scientist or technical  
expert, but I understand the issues well enough to suggest with  
conviction that the OGC provides both models of deliberative process  
and models of technical approaches that the Open Data community could  
usefully adapt as planks in their platform. (OGC standards and  
participation have proven useful to OneGeology http://www.onegeology.org/ 
  and efforts in ocean observation, meteorology & climate, and  
hydrology.) Demonstrating solutions to the technical "data publish/ 
discover/assess/access/use" problems -- "See? It works!" -- puts  
pressure on scientists and the institutions of science to  
collaboratively develop new policies and practices.

As you note, the term "Open Data" is going mainstream, and there is  
considerable confusion about what it means. The OGC began as "Open GIS  
Consortium" and then renamed itself "Open Geospatial Consortium" and  
we are constantly educating audiences about the differences between  
"open standards" and "open source", encodings and data models,  
consensus-derived open interfaces and proprietary open interfaces,  
etc. Considerable thought and effort goes into "positioning" (as  
marketers say) one's organization and the organization's mission and  
products. It's all part of shaping the human world.

Dear all,

Here is in plain text the translation into Catalan of the PP.
If needed I also have it in HTML (with links)

Best,

Ignasi


Els Principis de Panton - Principis per obrir les dades cient?fiques

La ci?ncia es basa en aprofitar, reutilitzar i criticar obertament el
cos dels coneixements cient?fics publicats

Perqu? la ci?ncia funcioni amb efic?cia, i perqu? la societat pugui
aprofitar plenament els avantatges de l?activitat cient?fica, ?s
fonamental que les dades cient?fiques siguin obertes

En l??mbit cient?fic entenem com a dades obertes aquelles que es
troben disponibles de manera gratu?ta a la internet p?blica i que
permeten a qualsevol usuari descarregar-les, copiar-les,
analitzar-les, tronar-les a processar, transmetre-les a qualsevol
programari o utilitzar-les per qualsevol altre prop?sit sense barreres
econ?miques, legals o t?cniques llevat d?aquelles intr?nseques al
propi acc?s a internet. Amb aquesta finalitat les dades relacionades
amb les publicacions cient?fiques han de ser expl?citament lliurades
al domini p?blic.

Formalment, recomanem adoptar i actuar d?acord amb els principis seg?ents:

   1. Quan es publiquin dades o col?leccions de dades ?s fonamental
que qui les publiqui hi adjunti una declaraci? clara i expl?cita dels
desitjos i les expectatives referents a la utilitzaci? dels elements
individuals de les dades, del recull de dades en conjunt, i dels
subconjunts de la col?lecci? per a als mateixos prop?sits o d?altres.
Aquesta declaraci? ha de ser inequ?voca, irrevocable, i en base a una
declaraci? legal adient i reconeguda en forma d'una ren?ncia o d?una
llic?ncia.

Quan publiqueu dades feu una declaraci? expl?cita i clara dels vostres desitjos

   2. Moltes de les llic?ncies ?mpliament reconegudes ni estan
destinades ni s?n adients per ser aplicades a dades o a col?leccions
de dades. Aqu? es descriuen un ventall de ren?ncies i llic?ncies que
s'han dissenyat i adequat al tractament de les dades. Les llic?ncies
de Creative Commons (llevat de CCZero), la GFDL, la GPL, la BSD, ...
NO s?n adients per a les dades i se?n desaconsella DECIDIDAMENT el seu
?s.

Utilitzeu una ren?ncia o una llic?ncia reconeguda que sigui adient per a dades.

   3. Es desaconsella DECIDIDAMENT l'?s de llic?ncies que limiten la
reutilitzaci? comercial o limiten la producci? d?obres derivades,
mitjan?ant l?exclusi? d?usos per a fins particulars o per persones o
organitzacions espec?fiques. Aquestes llic?ncies no permeten integrar
de manera efica? els conjunts de dades ni utilitzar-los amb nous
prop?sits i eviten activitats comercials que poden ser ?tils per donar
suport a la preservaci? de les dades.

Si voleu que les vostres dades siguin utilitzades amb efic?cia i
puguin rebre contribucions d?altres, han d'estar obertes tal i com
s?estableix en la Definici? de coneixement i dades obertes- en
particular, no heu d?utilitzar cap mena de cl?usula restrictiva com
les que impedeixen usos comercials.

   4. D'altra banda, en l??mbit de la ci?ncia ?s DECIDIDAMENT
recomanable que les dades, especialment  les obtingudes amb fons
p?blics, siguin lliurades de forma expl?cita al domini p?blic
mitjan?ant l'?s del Lliurament i llic?ncia al domini p?blic (PDDL) o
la ren?ncia de Creative Commons Zero (CCZero). Aquest lliurament est?
en conson?ncia amb el finan?ament p?blic de la majoria de la recerca
cient?fica i l'?tica general de compartir i reutilitzar dins de la
comunitat cient?fica.

Es recomana fermament el lliurament al domini p?blic de les dades
subjacents a les publicacions cient?fiques mitjan?ant la PDDL o CCZero
per garantir el compliment tant del Protocol de Science Commons per a
l?aplicaci? de l?acc?s obert a les dades com la Definici? de
coneixement i dades obertes.

Having developed Chemical Markup Language I am fully aware of the problems.
I have spoken with OGC people from time to time. XML is useful for some
parts, but tends to enforce a rigid approach.

I am keen on a microformat-like approach to schemas unless the community
knows very clearly what is doing and agrees.

I think each domain is different. In geosscience you have funded projects
bridging many institutions and there is a requirement to use common
approaches. There is the problem than vendors try to create lockin.

In chemistry we have a Holy Roman Empire of feudal fighting commercial and
proprietary companies and pseudo-companies (Am. Chem. Soc.) is the worst.
The wish to won and sell data and control metadata. Result: the technology
is years behind where it should be. We have set up the BlueObelisk as a
centre for chemical open source http://www.blueobelisk.org . We have no
support except ourselves but we now produce the best software and will
inexorably win through that.

There could be a lot of value in summarising the main Opne efforts in each

It looks like they went a step too far. SDSS (where the photos are from) 
only disallow commercial use, not remixing. Oh well.

Also, there is the question of whether or not ANY image produced by a 
telescope has the requisite authorship/creative expression to receive 
copyright protection.

Principios Panton



Principios para Datos Abiertos en Ciencia

La ciencia se basa en aprovechar, reutilizar y criticar abiertamente el
cuerpo de conocimiento cient?fico publicado.

Para que la ciencia funcione de modo efectivo, y para que la sociedad pueda
aprovechar plenamente las ventajas de las actividades cient?ficas, es
fundamental que los datos cient?ficos se abran<http://www.opendefinition.org/>.


En el ?mbito de la ciencia por datos abiertos nos referimos a su
disponibilidad gratuita en Internet permitiendo a cualquier usuario
descargarlos, copiarlos, analizarlos, reprocesarlos, transferirlos a un
software, o utilizarlos para cualquier otro prop?sito, sin barreras
financieras, legales o t?cnicas fuera de aquellas que son inseparables del
acceso a Internet. *Con este fin, los datos asociados a las publicaciones
cient?ficas debieran ser expl?citamente colocados en el dominio p?blico. ***

*Formalmente, recomendamos adoptar y actuar de acuerdo a los siguientes
principios*:

1.      En el momento de publicar los datos o colecciones de datos es
fundamental que dicha publicaci?n est? acompa?ada de una declaraci?n clara y
expl?cita de los deseos y expectativas de quienes los publican con respecto
a la reutilizaci?n, y prop?sitos de uso de los elementos individuales de los
datos, de la colecci?n completa as? como de subconjuntos dentro de la
colecci?n. Esta declaraci?n debe ser inequ?voca, irrevocable y en lenguaje
legal adecuado de modo que tome la forma de renuncia o licencia.

*En el momento de publicar haga una declaraci?n expl?cita y clara de sus
deseos respecto de los datos que publica.***

2.      Muchas de las renuncias al derecho y licencias ya reconocidas no
tienen como objetivo ni son apropiadas para datos o colecciones de datos.
Licencias que han sido dise?adas y s? son apropiadas para el manejo de datos
est?n descritas aqu? <http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/#Data>. Las
licencias del ?Creative Commons? (con excepci?n de CCZero), GFDL, GPL, BSD,
etc., NO son adecuadas para datos y se desaconseja ENCARECIDAMENTE su uso.

*Utilice una renuncia o una licencia reconocida que sea apropiada para
datos.***

3.      Se desaconseja ENCARECIDAMENTE el uso de licencias que limitan la
reutilizaci?n comercial o limitan la producci?n de obras derivados mediante
la exclusi?n del uso para fines particulares o de personas u organizaciones
espec?ficas. Estas licencias imposibilitan la efectiva integraci?n de los
conjuntos de datos y su utilizaci?n para nuevos prop?sitos e impiden
actividades comerciales que podr?an ser ?tiles para la preservaci?n de los
datos.

*Si desea que sus datos sean utilizados con eficacia y puedan recibir
contribuciones de terceros su publicaci?n debe ser de forma abierta de
acuerdo a la definici?n establecida en Open Knowledge/Data
Definition<http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/>- en particular, no
deben utilizarse clausulas restrictivas tales como las
que impiden usos con fines comerciales.***

4.      Adem?s en el ?mbito cient?fico se recomienda ENCARECIDAMENTE que los
datos, especialmente aquellos que resultan de subsidios p?blicos, sean
expl?citamente colocados en el dominio p?blico a trav?s de la Entrega al
Dominio P?blico o la renuncia o licencia de Creative Commons Zero. Esto est?
en consonancia con el subsidio p?blico de gran parte de la actividad
cient?fica y con los c?digos de ?tica  de compartir y reutilizar datos
dentro de la comunidad cient?fica.

*Se recomienda encarecidamente la entrega expl?cita al dominio p?blico de
los datos que acompa?an las publicaciones mediante licencias PDDL o CCZero
que garantizan el cumplimiento del protocolo del acceso abierto a los datos
del Science Commons (Protocol for Implementing Open Access
Data<http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/>)
y la definici?n del Open Knowledge/Data
Definition<http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/>

PLEASE COMMENT

I now need to start thinking in earnest about my presentation at Berkeley. I
shall be speaking non-officially for the OKF (the title of my ten minutes is

"The Open Knowledge Foundation"
so I need to be representative.

- I shall stick to science (no time to talk about Shakespear, WDMMG, etc.
- start with the OKD. I think this is now quasi-scriptural and should be
used like the US use the pronouncements of the founding fathers - from the
OKD everything flows.
- the OKD has an overarching role to make sure that all components of the
scientific
environment are, where possible, OKD-Open. I shall assert that non-Openness
leads to friction, delay and worst of all bad science
- the following are necessary for Open science:
* Open Source (not essential but increasingly important for verfication and
innovation)
* Open Access (CC-BY only, critical for data-mining and text-mining)
* Open Standards (agreements on interoperability)
* Open Services (increasingly results will be obtaiined from the cloud)
* Open Data (PP-compliant)
* Open Methodology == Reproducible Science

Although I support OpenNotebook science (where the data are immediately
published to the world) I don't think it's essential (or possible) for all
science.
We can also add
* Open bibliography
* Open ThesisIndex

Do people feel this is a reasonable overview of what OKF can contribute to
Open Science. I'm not going to say anything about OSS and OA (other in that
the OKF covers the appropriate licences). But I will count them in the
flower petals.

So
Do we agree th flower logo is a good idea for the OKF in science. Each petal
is a subtopic and people can colour them red if they have actually done
that. They can get pink if they have half done it.

So I get
OS red
OA red
OStand red
OServ light pink (I have exposed a free service but it's not formally OKF
compliant)
OD red
OM pink - I have tried to define and expose reproducible methodology but not
yet succeeded.

So please help bring this together for something that has the rough
consensus of this list.

P.




How many petals and what should they be?

Just a few brief comments:

Not sure about the colour! I was reading through your description of
yourself and thought ?Open Source ? Red, huh??. Might blue/yellow be better?
Obviously green is not an option...

I still feel that open materials is an important addition. In much (most?)
biological sciences you could make all the results, process, data available
and still block anyone else from re-using, exploiting, or reproducing your
research by not making the underlying physical materials (tools, samples,
etc) available. Obviously its a much harder problem to crack because these
are usually rivalrous goods. I?d still be inclined to reduce the number of
petals if possible ? too many starts to get confusing I think.

My personal view of ONS is that it is simply a question of when things are
released.  I think the key point is that when a decision to publish is made
that each of the ?open areas? gets considered. That?s an achievable goal
within existing publishing and funding structures. So ONS can be framed as a
question about how and when to publish and the question as to what should be
published is orthogonal.

PRESS RELEASE:
SILICOS NV PORTS ITS PROPRIETARY COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY SOFTWARE INTO THE
OPEN SOURCE DOMAIN

On June 22, 2010, the Belgium-based computational chemistry company
Silicos NV has made a
strategic decision to port the majority of its proprietary software
into the open source arena. The
decision has been made to port all of these tools and the
corresponding C/C++ API's into the Open
Babel environment under a GNU GPL licensing scheme. This strategic
decision will position
Silicos NV as one of the leading computational chemistry services
companies to support the open
source business model. According to Hans De Winter, Silicos' CSO, 'the
decision will allow Silicos to
move forward rapidly on the expanding wave of open source software
tools, and will significantly
expand its possibilities of providing services to customers in the
pharmaceutical and
biotechnological industry.'


About Silicos' proprietary software tools

Spectrophores??are Silicos' patented 3D-field descriptors.
Spectrophores? are a one-dimensional
description of three-dimensional molecular properties, such as atomic
electrostatic charges,
atomic lipophilicity, atomic softness, atomic electrophilicity and
shape. Spectrophores? have been
succesfully used for clients to build sophisticated QSAR models in
combination with many
statistical modelling algorithms like bayesian classification and
support vector machines. Due to
their numeric nature, Spectophores? are well-suited for the
calculation of self-organising maps.

Pharao?is Silicos' implementation of a pharmacophore-based alignment
tool. It uses a Gaussian
representation of pharmacophoric features and generates an alignment
between pairs of a set of
pharmacophores. The resulting match is quantified using different
measures including a Tanimoto
coefficient.

Piramid?is Silicos' software tool incorporating a shape-based
alignment between pairs of
molecules. Again, the resulting match is quantified using different
measures including a Tanimoto
coefficient.

Finally,?Cosmos??is Silicos' patented technology for the design of
novel molecules using an
evolutionary algorithm and using user-specified scoring functions. The
tool has been adapted to
be used in a fragment-based discovery enviroment. It has been
succesfully used in a number of
drug discovery programs in which Cosmos? was able to generate novel
chemistry that has not
been described before. The strength of Cosmos? lies in its
multi-objective optimisation algorithm
as well as in the fact that virtually all kinds of scoring functions
can be integrated.


About Silicos NV

Silicos NV is providing services in the field of computational
chemistry and virtual screening. The
company was founded in 2005 by two former employees of a major
pharmaceutical company in
Belgium and a former researcher at the ESAT-group of the Catholic
University of Louvain. Silicos is
a spin-out of the Catholic University of Louvain.

"""
Silicos' virtual screening technology is based on a unique concept
called Spectrophores?. These are descriptors reflecting all possible
three-dimensional molecular properties which are involved in the
binding of a drug to its receptor, including electrostatic potential,
lipophilicity, softness, and shape.

Cosmos? is Silicos' platform for the in silico, de novo design of
small molecules. The program serves as a fragment-based molecular
optimization application, in which novel molecules are generated by
combining fragments in a virtual synthesis step. These molecular
structures are further optimized in single or multi-objective
optimisation procedures. The evaluation of the quality of the
molecules can be ligand-based or target-based which makes Cosmos? a
very flexible platform for de novo drug discovery.

Pharao is a pharmacophore-based tool to score and align small
molecules. The tool is based on the concept of modeling pharmacophoric
features by Gaussian 3D volumes instead of the more common point or
sphere representations. The smooth nature of these continuous
functions has a beneficent effect on the optimization problem
introduced during alignment.

SiMath is Silicos' open source API for statistical and mathematical
data modeling. SiMath is C++ library which integrates several open
source libraries into one library and which can easily included in
other applications.
"""

"""
De Novo design with Cosmos?

Cosmos? is an acronym for Computational Optimization of Small
Molecular Structures. It is a highly flexible in silico platform,
based on a genetic algorithm for the evolution of molecules guided by
one or more evaluation functions and fragment-based virtual synthesis.
Evaluation functions can be ligand- and target-based.

As in a classical in vitro setup, Cosmos? is build round three main
blocks: virtual synthesis, evaluation or virtual screening, and
optimization. The process is illustrated in the flowchart above. In
the virtual synthesis step, de novo molecules are developed from a set
of predefined building blocks and connectivity rules. Both building
blocks and connectivity rules have been extracted from known
compounds. As such, the possibility that the virtual compounds
actually are synthesized in a later stage is rather high. In the next
step, the molecules are evaluated using a virtual screening function.
The evaluation of the molecule can be based on any kind of function
and is completely flexible to meet the project needs. Typical
evaluators that have been tested, are docking, shape-based similarity,
fingerprint similarity, and Spectrophore? models. The optimization
step can be either a single- or multi-objective optimization depending
on the number of targets and different scoring functions. From the
scores, molecules are selected for further participation in the
evolutionary process. Genetic operators, like mutation and crossover,
have been implemented again using the same building blocks and
connectivity rules as defined in the virtual synthesis. This closes
the loop and the process restarts.

Example

To illustrate the potential of Cosmos?, cisapride has been used as a
test case. The crystal structure of cisapride was used a template
structure and new virtually synthesised compounds were compared with
the template using a shape-based scoring function.

Hi Open Science,

Does anyone have some decent stats on open access journals?  Tried to
look at impact factors but they're behind a paywall.

Specifically, I need hard facts to counter the claim that open access
are more 'downmarket' than their closed competitors.

thanks,

That's a question I don't know the answer to, but as an editor of an open access journal (ijdc.net, about digital curation), it makes me wonder what stats people would like, and how to get them collected...

Eg how does one set about getting a journal to have an impact factor?

We did some research last year on downloads and article citation rates, using Google Scholar, mentioned in the Editorial to the issue prior to the one just published, see http://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/viewFile/129/169. Annoyingly there doesn't appear to be an API to Google Scholar, making this a tedious piece of desk research that needs repeating each time its to be reported. Are there better measures we could compute more easily at low cost? (Open Access journals do not have high budgets.)

One can programmatically access references from papers in PubMed Central to
get at some of this information.

Obviously only catches biomed articles, and isn't as comprehensive and
Scopus or ISI references, but perhaps useful nonetheless?

Refs can be used to calculate a journal-impact-factor proxy.

I have some python code to do this... I think it is openly online but not
easy for someone else to pick up and use, alas ... let me know (anyone) if
interested and we can work on it together?

btw can always point to PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine as quick counter
examples ;)

The Research Information Network (RIN) recently published a booklet
explain what is open access and trying to dispel some of the myths. It
might help.

I agree - though this is even more difficult than data - and is not
cost-free. I think Science Commons is active here

I agree and I am going to blog something. But I tried this 2 years ago and
allowed a day for the summarised computational data to get to the web page
and was told this delay meant it was not ONS. That it gave me an advantage.
I suspect some of this was mischievous, but anyway the area needs
clarifying.

Re: how to convince someone to publish open access?

This blog post about the latest round of Impact Factors from BMC
journals might be helpful:
http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/new_and_improved_
impact_factors1

No longer up-to-date, but these open access myths might be of interest
in constructing/anticipating arguments to the model:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/inquiry/myths/?myth=all

BMC-specific but also see:
http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/faq?name=why

And the open citation project is always helpful if there is discussion
about downloads vs. citations:

PRESS RELEASE:
SILICOS NV PORTS ITS PROPRIETARY COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY SOFTWARE INTO
THE
OPEN SOURCE DOMAIN

On June 22, 2010, the Belgium-based computational chemistry company
Silicos NV has made a
strategic decision to port the majority of its proprietary software
into the open source arena. The
decision has been made to port all of these tools and the
corresponding C/C++ API's into the Open
Babel environment under a GNU GPL licensing scheme. This strategic
decision will position
Silicos NV as one of the leading computational chemistry services
companies to support the open
source business model. According to Hans De Winter, Silicos' CSO, 'the
decision will allow Silicos to
move forward rapidly on the expanding wave of open source software
tools, and will significantly
expand its possibilities of providing services to customers in the
pharmaceutical and
biotechnological industry.'


About Silicos' proprietary software tools

Spectrophores??are Silicos' patented 3D-field descriptors.
Spectrophores? are a one-dimensional
description of three-dimensional molecular properties, such as atomic
electrostatic charges,
atomic lipophilicity, atomic softness, atomic electrophilicity and
shape. Spectrophores? have been
succesfully used for clients to build sophisticated QSAR models in
combination with many
statistical modelling algorithms like bayesian classification and
support vector machines. Due to
their numeric nature, Spectophores? are well-suited for the
calculation of self-organising maps.

Pharao?is Silicos' implementation of a pharmacophore-based alignment
tool. It uses a Gaussian
representation of pharmacophoric features and generates an alignment
between pairs of a set of
pharmacophores. The resulting match is quantified using different
measures including a Tanimoto
coefficient.

Piramid?is Silicos' software tool incorporating a shape-based
alignment between pairs of
molecules. Again, the resulting match is quantified using different
measures including a Tanimoto
coefficient.

Finally,?Cosmos??is Silicos' patented technology for the design of
novel molecules using an
evolutionary algorithm and using user-specified scoring functions. The
tool has been adapted to
be used in a fragment-based discovery enviroment. It has been
succesfully used in a number of
drug discovery programs in which Cosmos? was able to generate novel
chemistry that has not
been described before. The strength of Cosmos? lies in its
multi-objective optimisation algorithm
as well as in the fact that virtually all kinds of scoring functions
can be integrated.


About Silicos NV

Silicos NV is providing services in the field of computational
chemistry and virtual screening. The
company was founded in 2005 by two former employees of a major
pharmaceutical company in
Belgium and a former researcher at the ESAT-group of the Catholic
University of Louvain. Silicos is
a spin-out of the Catholic University of Louvain.

"""
Silicos' virtual screening technology is based on a unique concept
called Spectrophores?. These are descriptors reflecting all possible
three-dimensional molecular properties which are involved in the
binding of a drug to its receptor, including electrostatic potential,
lipophilicity, softness, and shape.

Cosmos? is Silicos' platform for the in silico, de novo design of
small molecules. The program serves as a fragment-based molecular
optimization application, in which novel molecules are generated by
combining fragments in a virtual synthesis step. These molecular
structures are further optimized in single or multi-objective
optimisation procedures. The evaluation of the quality of the
molecules can be ligand-based or target-based which makes Cosmos? a
very flexible platform for de novo drug discovery.

Pharao is a pharmacophore-based tool to score and align small
molecules. The tool is based on the concept of modeling pharmacophoric
features by Gaussian 3D volumes instead of the more common point or
sphere representations. The smooth nature of these continuous
functions has a beneficent effect on the optimization problem
introduced during alignment.

SiMath is Silicos' open source API for statistical and mathematical
data modeling. SiMath is C++ library which integrates several open
source libraries into one library and which can easily included in
other applications.
"""

"""
De Novo design with Cosmos?

Cosmos? is an acronym for Computational Optimization of Small
Molecular Structures. It is a highly flexible in silico platform,
based on a genetic algorithm for the evolution of molecules guided by
one or more evaluation functions and fragment-based virtual synthesis.
Evaluation functions can be ligand- and target-based.

As in a classical in vitro setup, Cosmos? is build round three main
blocks: virtual synthesis, evaluation or virtual screening, and
optimization. The process is illustrated in the flowchart above. In
the virtual synthesis step, de novo molecules are developed from a set
of predefined building blocks and connectivity rules. Both building
blocks and connectivity rules have been extracted from known
compounds. As such, the possibility that the virtual compounds
actually are synthesized in a later stage is rather high. In the next
step, the molecules are evaluated using a virtual screening function.
The evaluation of the molecule can be based on any kind of function
and is completely flexible to meet the project needs. Typical
evaluators that have been tested, are docking, shape-based similarity,
fingerprint similarity, and Spectrophore? models. The optimization
step can be either a single- or multi-objective optimization depending
on the number of targets and different scoring functions. From the
scores, molecules are selected for further participation in the
evolutionary process. Genetic operators, like mutation and crossover,
have been implemented again using the same building blocks and
connectivity rules as defined in the virtual synthesis. This closes
the loop and the process restarts.

Example

To illustrate the potential of Cosmos?, cisapride has been used as a
test case. The crystal structure of cisapride was used a template
structure and new virtually synthesised compounds were compared with
the template using a shape-based scoring function.

Hi Open Science,

Does anyone have some decent stats on open access journals?  Tried to
look at impact factors but they're behind a paywall.

Specifically, I need hard facts to counter the claim that open access
are more 'downmarket' than their closed competitors.

thanks,

That's a question I don't know the answer to, but as an editor of an
open access journal (ijdc.net, about digital curation), it makes me
wonder what stats people would like, and how to get them collected...

Eg how does one set about getting a journal to have an impact factor?

We did some research last year on downloads and article citation rates,
using Google Scholar, mentioned in the Editorial to the issue prior to
the one just published, see
http://ijdc.net/index.php/ijdc/article/viewFile/129/169. Annoyingly
there doesn't appear to be an API to Google Scholar, making this a
tedious piece of desk research that needs repeating each time its to be
reported. Are there better measures we could compute more easily at low
cost? (Open Access journals do not have high budgets.)

One can programmatically access references from papers in PubMed Central
to
get at some of this information.

Obviously only catches biomed articles, and isn't as comprehensive and
Scopus or ISI references, but perhaps useful nonetheless?

Refs can be used to calculate a journal-impact-factor proxy.

I have some python code to do this... I think it is openly online but
not
easy for someone else to pick up and use, alas ... let me know (anyone)
if
interested and we can work on it together?

btw can always point to PLoS Biology and PLoS Medicine as quick counter
examples ;)

Hi,

The Research Information Network (RIN) recently published a booklet
explain what is open access and trying to dispel some of the myths. It
might help.

I agree - though this is even more difficult than data - and is not
cost-free. I think Science Commons is active here

I agree and I am going to blog something. But I tried this 2 years ago
and
allowed a day for the summarised computational data to get to the web
page
and was told this delay meant it was not ONS. That it gave me an
advantage.
I suspect some of this was mischievous, but anyway the area needs
clarifying.

Principios Panton
Principios para abrir los datos cient?ficos
La ciencia se basa en aprovechar, reutilizar y criticar abiertamente el
cuerpo de conocimiento cient?fico publicado.
Para que la ciencia funcione de modo efectivo, y para que la sociedad pueda
aprovechar plenamente las ventajas de las actividades cient?ficas, es
fundamental que los datos cient?ficos se abran<http://www.opendefinition.org/>
.
En el ?mbito de la ciencia por datos abiertos nos referimos a su
disponibilidad gratuita en Internet permitiendo a cualquier usuario
descargarlos, copiarlos, analizarlos, volverlos a procesar, transferirlos a
un software, o utilizarlos para cualquier otro prop?sito, sin barreras
econ?micas, legales o t?cnicas fuera de aquellas que son inseparables del
acceso a Internet. Con este fin, los datos asociados a las publicaciones
cient?ficas debieran ser expl?citamente colocados en el dominio p?blico.
Formalmente, recomendamos adoptar y actuar de acuerdo a los siguientes
principios:

1.      En el momento de publicar los datos o colecciones de datos es
fundamental que dicha publicaci?n est? acompa?ada de una declaraci?n clara y
expl?cita de los deseos y expectativas de quienes los publican con respecto
a la reutilizaci?n, y prop?sitos de uso de los elementos individuales de los
datos, de la colecci?n completa as? como de subconjuntos dentro de la
colecci?n. Esta declaraci?n debe ser inequ?voca, irrevocable y en lenguaje
legal adecuado de modo que tome la forma de renuncia o licencia.

En el momento de publicar haga una declaraci?n expl?cita y clara de sus
deseos respecto de los datos que publica.

2.      Muchas de las renuncias al derecho y licencias ya reconocidas no
tienen como objetivo ni son apropiadas para datos o colecciones de datos.
Aqu? <http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/#Data>  est?n descritas algunas
de las licencias que han sido dise?adas y s? son apropiadas para el manejo
de datos.  Las licencias del ?Creative Commons? (con excepci?n de CCZero),
GFDL, GPL, BSD, etc, NO son adecuadas para datos y se desaconseja
ENCARECIDAMENTE su uso.

Utilice una renuncia o una licencia reconocida que sea apropiada para datos.

3.      Se desaconseja ENCARECIDAMENTE el uso de licencias que limitan la
reutilizaci?n comercial o limitan la producci?n de obras derivados mediante
la exclusi?n del uso para fines particulares o de personas u organizaciones
espec?ficas. Estas licencias imposibilitan la efectiva integraci?n de los
conjuntos de datos y su utilizaci?n para nuevos prop?sitos e impiden
actividades comerciales que podr?an ser ?tiles para la preservaci?n de los
datos.

Si desea que sus datos sean utilizados con eficacia y puedan recibir
contribuciones de terceros su publicaci?n debe ser de forma abierta de
acuerdo a la definici?n establecida en Open Knowledge/Data
Definition<http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/>- en particular, no
deben utilizarse clausulas restrictivas tales como las
que impiden usos con fines comerciales.

4.      Adem?s en el ?mbito cient?fico se recomienda ENCARECIDAMENTE que los
datos, especialmente aquellos que resultan de subsidios p?blicos, sean
expl?citamente colocados en el dominio p?blico a trav?s de la Entrega y
Licencia al Dominio P?blico (PDDL) o la renuncia o licencia de Creative
Commons Cero (CCZero). Esto est? en consonancia con el subsidio p?blico de
gran parte de la actividad cient?fica y con los c?digos de ?tica  de
compartir y reutilizar datos dentro de la comunidad cient?fica.

Se recomienda encarecidamente la entrega expl?cita al dominio p?blico de los
datos que acompa?an las publicaciones mediante licencias PDDL o CCZero que
garantizan el cumplimiento del protocolo del acceso abierto a los datos del
Science Commons (Protocol for Implementing Open Access
Data<http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/>)

I have now started to lay out my thoughts on my blog (see
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2471 and onwards)

At present my approach is likely to be:
* The OKF is a first-stop for people interested in some aspect of Openness.
It may not be the most detailed, but it is comprehensive. (I'll mention
F/OSS and OpenAcess in this light - there are more specialised sites but you
can find them from the OKF and you can bounce them off OKF people)
* The OKF is the leading place for many things, such as Open Data and Open
Bibliography
* If you have a new concern about Open and don't know where to start , the
OKF is the best place.
* I will then elaborate about Open data and what the OKF was able to provide
* then I will explain what we hope to do with the Panton Papers.

That will take 10 minutes. There is a consistent theme. I am not sure
whether I can use the flower analogy - probably yes - it will take 30-60
seconds. I defintely think the OKF should run with it.

I have started to outline ideas of Panton Papers on my blog:

http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2474 is an initial overview

http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2475 is a first try at a rough
draft of the first paper "What is Scientific Data?" [apologies for
formatting being trashed by Wordpress].

I have bounced this off 2 scientists over the last two days and got
reasonable agreement that the ideas are coherent and central. But I'd like
more feedback and suggestions as to how to proceed. We are discussing this
as an item on the Aug 4th WG . Should we have a wiki? or an Etherpad where
each is edited and commented? - I want this to be communal.

A big issue we have here at the moment is that:

a) people are under no obligation to respond
b) we probably should add a facility to ping automatedly enquiry
creators if their enquiry has not got answered after a certain time.
(E.g. my enquiry to UN [1] seems to have disappeared into the long
grass so I should ping them again)
c) people sometimes respond out of band (where you write to people you
sort of know) (e.g. the planning alerts data enquiry [2] was
successful but they didn't respond on the site and I think this was
also true for some of PMR's enquiries). This is a problem as it means
we don't have a public statement.

I think this would be a great feature. Any interested coders :) ?

Just to say this all seems great Peter. I also note you are always
free to reuse slides/images etc from existing OKF presentations
(mainly html/s5 based if so the page is the source ...):

<http://m.okfn.org/files/talks/>

In particular, we have a set of sample slides for introducing the OKF
specifically designed for reuse in other presentations:

<http://m.okfn.org/files/talks/okf_intro/>

Amazing! In the first instance I created a pad for this here:

  http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers

If we wanted we could create, e.g.:

  http://pantonpapers.okfnpad.org/WhatIsData

or

  http://pantonpapers.okfnpad.org/1

But it might be nice to keep them all on the 'science' pad. (All: if
anyone wants admin access to help maintain this, please drop me a line
off list!)

Also blogged Panton Papers at:

  http://blog.okfn.org/2010/07/26/introducing-the-panton-papers/

All the best,

Jonathan

Added Peter's original list of issues, and a couple of my own here, with 
some minor edits and comments.  Hope that's okay (please let me know if 
not).

Mark,
This is one of the wonderful things about the OKF - that people will pick up
and share the development and maintenance.

Many thanks,

P.

Of course it is!

I see my role as a catalyst/seed at the moment, roughing out the issues.
Some I am much more familiar with than others. For example I am reasonably
expert in text- and data-mining while I am undoubtedly patchy in "who owns
data". So I think it would be fairly easy to get out something on *-mining,
while it could take months while we wrangle (necessarily) over the legal,
contractual and moral issues of data ownership.

In some cases I think we can reasonably create a set of generalities and
questions (e.g. a sort of checklist for people venturing into this
sub-domain). In others such as ownership we may have to have a
county-by-country account of legislation and maybe even per-institution.

We are *absolutely relying* on others to contribute! I doubt if anyone has
the whole picture

Just to let you all know, Daniel Mietchen (in cc) has kindly agreed to
administer the science.okfnpad.org and to administer/create any other
pads that this group needs! So if we need additional pads/pages, or
you'd like a user/admin account to create these -- please contact
Daniel in the first instance!

Many thanks Daniel! ;-)

All the best,

Jonathan

It may be premature but if each PantonPaper is a nucleus for discussion and
future drafting, maybe we need a resource for each (pad, wiki?).

Ultimately (and perhaps quite soon) I would agree. The current pad is a good
start though I think. My feeling is that the high level ideas/subjects will
also need some working out before splitting into separate documents. But
once it?s clear what those will be I think splitting and dividing up the
work would be a good strategy.

Cheers

Cameron

**Apologies for Cross-Posting!**

The Science, Technology and Medicine team at the British Library are
piloting our new ?Search Our Catalogue? tool as a way to help
researchers discover datasets. Search Our Catalogue (SoC) brings
together the wealth of the Library's content into a single search. To
explore researcher needs for finding research datasets, we are
enabling the discovery and display of information about them in SoC.
This is one of our first experiments with signposting users to content
not held by us but accessed elsewhere on the internet.

For this pilot, we have selected a trial collection of datasets on the
theme of environmental change, specifically:
?- ?observations of climate, weather, the atmosphere and oceans
?- ?air quality and emissions into the atmosphere
?- ?renewable energy

As we are in the early stages of developing this service, we would
value your thoughts to help us improve it, especially if you have
comments on the metadata given for data records. Please visit the
science web page ?http://www.bl.uk/science ?and follow the link to
find out more. We would encourage anyone with an interest in
environmental datasets to visit ?http://searchbeta.bl.uk ?to see what
they can find.

Please email your comments and questions to us at science at bl.uk.

I hope to come up with about one paper per day. I would expect (?at least,
?about) another week so then we can  see what we've got.

Excellent Bryan, the video and audio have both gone down and we'll all
appreciate that later.

Feel free to post among the tweets if you like, we are archiving everything
hashtagged #oss2010 in http://opensciencefoundation.com/oss2010/ -- also an
open blog to which any OSF site member can post. Thus we will have a
searchable archive after the Twitter Search cache has moved on. BG
