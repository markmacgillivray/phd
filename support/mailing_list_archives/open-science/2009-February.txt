Message-ID: <b68e90820902040401o4cadc9d7m18a52d197e597edd@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Cameron, Peter and others,

I've been planning to write a full piece about 'openness' and
licensing in relation to data for a while. Prompted by recent
discussions with John Wilbanks and then the post of Michael Nielsen on
"The role of open licensing in open science" [1] I've put together a
brief  'analysis' that I think might be useful.

The full analysis can be found below or, for those who prefer reading
websites rather than lists, the text is also posted up at:

<http://blog.okfn.org/2009/02/02/open-data-openness-and-licensing/>

This is obviously an important debate for 'open science' and I'd be
really interested in the views of others. I know that some of the
points made in this piece aren't shared by everyone -- for example, I
know John Wilbanks is not a fan of the license approach (or of
share-alike conditions) :)

Lastly there are two appendices for this essay which I've left out in
the interests of length. One is on 'Facts and Databases' the other is
'Comments on the Science Commons Protocol'. I'd be happy to send them
along if anyone wants to them.

Regards,

Rufus

# Openness and Licensing of (Open) Data

## Why does this matter?

Why bother about openness and licensing for data? After all they don't
matter in themselves: what we really care about are things like the
progress of human knowledge or the freedom to understand and share.

However, open data is crucial to progress on these more fundamental
items. It's crucial because open data is so much easier to break-up
and recombine, to use and reuse. We therefore want people to have
incentives to make their data open and for open data to be easily
usable and reusable -- i.e. for open data to form a 'commons'.

A good definition of openness acts as a standard that ensures
different open datasets are 'interoperable' and therefore do form a
commons. Licensing is important because it reduces uncertainty.
Without a license you don't know where you, as a user, stand: when are
you allowed to use this data? Are you allowed to give to others? To
distribute your own changes, etc?

Together, a definition of openness, plus a set of conformant licenses
deliver clarity and simplicity. Not only is interoperability ensured
but people can know at a glance, and without having to go through a
whole lot of legalese, what they are free to do. (For more see [this
article][why] and [this post][explicit]).

**Thus, licensing and definitions are important even though they are
only a small part of the overall picture. If we get them wrong they
will keep on getting in the way of everything else. If we get them
right we can stop worrying about them and focus our full energies on
other things.**

## Background

Over the last couple of years there has been substantial discussion
about the licensing (or not) of (open) data and what 'open' should
mean. In this debate there two distinct, but related, strands:

  1. Some people have argued that licensing is inappropriate (or
unnecessary) for data.
  2. Disagreement about what 'open' should mean. Specifically: does
openness allow for attribution and share-alike 'requirements' or
should 'open' data mean 'public domain' data?

These points are related because arguments for the inappropriateness
of licensing data usually go along the lines: data equates to facts
over which no monopoly IP rights can or should be granted; as such all
data is automatically in the public domain and hence there is nothing
to license (and worse 'licensing' amounts to an attempt to 'enclose'
the public domain).

However, even those who think that open data can/should only be public
domain data still agree that it is reasonable and/or necessary to have
some set of community 'rules' or 'norms' governing usage of data.
Therefore, the question of what requirements should be allowed for
'open' data is a common one, whatever one's stance on the PD question.

Of course, even with agreement on requirements, there is still the
question of whether these should be 'enforced' through a license or
via community norms. To summarize, the three main questions are:

**Qu 1. Is it important to license?**

**Qu 2: What 'restrictive' requirements are compatible with openness?
In particular does 'open' equate to PD only or are attribution and
share-alike 'requirements' permitted?**

**Qu 3: Community norms or licenses? Should 'community norms' or
license terms be used in order to encode requirements such as
attribution and share-alike?**

Below I look at each of these in turn, laying out, as I see it, the
current consensus and expressing my own view.


## Question 1: Is it Important to License?

The simple answer here is yes. Whether one likes it or not there are a
whole bunch of jurisdictions where there are IP rights in data(bases).
Note that this does **not** imply any monopoly rights in any facts
that data represents.

Thus, even if you just want your data to be in the 'public domain',
you need to apply a license -- or something very closely resembling a
license. (A suitable example is the Open Data Commons [Public Domain
Dedication and License][pddl]).

[pddl]:http://www.opendatacommons.org/odc-public-domain-dedication-and-licence/

## Question 2: What Should Openness Allow?

Despite the sometimes heated discussion, there is, in fact, broad
agreement: openness means freedom to use and reuse data in any way you
wish. The only debate is over what, if any, conditions can be imposed
when allowing use and reuse. In particular, following the example of
the software and content domains, the following two items have been
proposed as permissible exceptions to the basic rule of 'allow
everything':

  1. Requirement of attribution (in a non-burdensome manner)
  2. Requirement to share-alike (a reuser or share-alike material
must, when making publicly available their own material, make it
openly available under a similar share-alike license)

### Attribution

Everyone agrees that requiring attribution is OK. Furthermore, it also
now generally accepted that having this requirement in a license is
not be a problem.

(In the original [Protocol for Implementing Open Access
Data][protocol] attribution was alleged to be problematic due to a
potential for 'attribution stacking'. However, these concerns appear
to have been allayed. To my mind, it was never clear why data needed
to be different: code and content both have plenty of examples of
projects with many contributors, much reuse *and* an attribution
requirement).

### Share-Alike

Share-alike provisions are more controversial. It has been argued that
share-alike conditions are problematic because of the potential for
incompatibility between two share-alike licenses (or community norms).
At the same time share-alike may provide an important incentive for
individuals and communities to make their data openly available since
it provides some assurance that this data will remain open. Thus, any
evaluation comes down to the balance between:

1. The costs, if any, of allowing share-alike in terms of e.g.
complexity and compatibility.

2. The benefits, if any, that share-alike provides by encouraging the
creation of open data in the first place and in ensuring subsequent
'sharing back' by those who build upon that data.

In my view the benefits are substantial while the costs are not.
Incompatibility can largely be avoided by only 'approving' share-alike
licenses that are compatible. At the same time, share-alike enshrines
a principle that is important to many communities in the code and
content spheres and same seems true of data (consider e.g. Open Street
Map).

(Aside: it is important to emphasize that permitting share-alike does
not mean it is must be used. In fact, a particular community could
recommend against using share-alike as, for example, the Python
community does for code hoping to make it into its standard library.)

## Question 3: Licenses versus Community Norms

Even if a basic license is used it can be argued that any
'requirements' for attribution or share-alike should not be in a
license but in 'community norms'. So which is best?

In my view, when making available data, licenses are much better than
community norms. Why?

  1. A license is always needed even if you are taking a PD approach.
So 'norms' don't obviate the need to license.
  2. A license is able to encode 'norms' both formally and informally
(for example, in a preamble -- cf. the GPL).
  3. A license is likely to elicit at least as much, and almost
certainly more, conformity with its provisions than community norms.
This is especially true outside of the community. The future is likely
to see a much more mixed data landscape whether in science or
elsewhere with many 'non-community' (non-academic) business and among
ordinary citizens. (Note also that for these groups the simplicity and
formality of a license makes it superior to 'norms' in almost every
respect -- transparency, certainty etc.
    * If there are concerns that, in some jurisdictions, the absence
of 'data' rights make e.g. share-alike provisions unenforceable
nothing is lost by using a license: the license de facto reverts to
the status of a community norm and any concerns regarding "false
expectations" can easily be dealt with by a simple warning.

**Flexibility:** some have argued that 'norms' are more 'flexible'
than licenses. I'm not clear what this really means:

  * Flexible = not enforceable. Perhaps true but I am unclear why this
is an advantage (even to a user it is easy to comply with the open
license)
  * Flexible = leeway around the edges. For example I won't get in
trouble if I don't attribute quite right. But this is true of licenses
too: it is very unlikely anyone gets sued for a minor error in
attribution and even with share-alike no court is likely to award
damages for a mistake made in good faith -- especially if it can be
easily corrected.
  * Flexible = fuzzy. Fuzziness does not seem an attractive property
when sharing data -- both sharer and sharee want clarity.
  * Flexible = easily changed. Allowing major changes is a serious
problem both for licensors and licensees (certainty and clarity would
disappear). For minor changes licenses are just as good.

Thus, in every respect I can think of, licenses are superior to
community norms when making available open data.


## Conclusion

Summarizing the the conclusions from the above discussion we have:

Qu 0: Does this matter?

**Yes.** A good definition of openness and the use of some form of
licensing is crucial to a healthy future for the open data community
(and that will be pretty much everyone ...).

Qu 1: Is it important to license?

Ans: **A 'license' is always necessary** -- even if you advocate a
PD-only approach. There is too much variation (and uncertainty) about
what the IP situation is across the world to just go with the default.
All providers of data should apply some kind of license or PD
dedication.

Qu 2: What 'restrictive' requirements are compatible with openness? In
particular does 'open' equate to PD only or are attribution and
share-alike 'requirements' permitted?

Ans: **Both attribution and share-alike should be permitted.**
Attribution is widely agreed to be acceptable. The second,
'share-alike' is more controversial, but in my view should be allowed:
there is no reason to break with the precedent set in code and content
domains and its benefits seem substantial while costs are minimal if
licenses are correctly managed.

Qu 3: Community norms or licenses?

Ans: **Use licenses when making available data.** Licenses provide all
the benefits of community norms in terms of explicitly encoding the
preferences of a community. At the same time they deliver greater
clarity and transparency, and, in many jurisdictions, provides a legal
enforceability which norms do not with regard to requirements of
attribution or share-alike.

## Colophon

Thanks for the useful comments :)

I think everyone agrees that whatever your go for (PD only or not) you
need something explicit and that something explicit is going to look
like a license.

The real debate is about what can be 'required' of users of open
material and whether those 'requirements' go in norms or licenses.
These two items seem to get confused a lot.

Most of the arguments I see from e.g. John at Science Commons against
requiring attribution and share-alike seem to apply just as much to
norms as to licenses. But do people really want to give these up? It
seems to me that attribution is absolutely central to the scientific
community -- and share-alike also seems pretty important to 'open
science' (no-one wants people taking lots of data and then keeping it
secret).

In that case it seems that the argument must be that these type of
provisions are somehow OK in norms but not in licenses. But this seems
weird (the only explanation I can think of is that the 'norms' are
really going to be 'enforced' but that does not seem a very attractive
answer).

Moving to the second point, whatever route you take (attribution or no
attribution requirement etc) what makes norms better than licenses?
Just like norms licenses are going to be enforced primarily by social
means though they have the added backup of being licenses (useful when
dealing those people especially outside of the 'community' who might
not play fair ...). Furthermore, Licenses seem as flexible (in the
good ways) as norms are (see the original essay for more on this).

Discussion here is both useful and important -- and any comments,
critical or otherwise will be much appreciated.

There have been occasions where license incompatibilities have been an
issue but I am not sure I'd agree that the 'commons has fragmented' in
open source. Do you have specific cases in mind?

I quite agree with you so I think there's a misunderstanding! I'm not
sure either that many scientists or other scholars will -- at least at
the beginning. 5 years experience of talking with people on this has
definitely taught me that :)

The question I would ask to you here: if encoding current norms
regarding data in licenses is a problem then encoding them in explicit
community norms is also a problem (and if we're not explicit there are
going to be serious problems ...).

> (3) the article implicitly assumes that the license (not the norm) is how

Let's be clear: most open licenses whether in software, content or
anywhere else aren't 'enforced' (and won't be enforced) by recourse to
the courts. Like norms licenses will be primarily enforced by social
pressure. Saying use licenses isn't saying: let's settle all our
disputes in courts! Much of the time a license is just a way to make
explicit what the 'social contract'. But it has the added advantage of
potentially being enforceable against those who might ignore the
social norms (I give other reasons in the essay so won't rehash them
again here).

So again perhaps there is a misunderstanding: I see (open) licenses as
a convenient and explicit encoding of what people can do with stuff
(with the added advantage that, in extremis they are 'legally'
enforceable).

Lastly, I should emphasize that I'm assuming throughout here that
we're talking about licensing for 'data' -- *not* about the governance
of the community as a whole, which, though partially related, is a
different and much larger matter.

Regards,

Rufus

my laptop was stolen yesterday so i am pecking this out on a
smartphone. apologies in advance for typos etc.

i think we have hit the key point on nrms v licenses. they will indeed
encode the same things and create similar problems. the difference is
that licenses further encode the right to obtain a prelinary
injunction for violation, and norms do not.

1. it is easy to imagine that in 14 we have very valuable data web,
and that a db under the eu directive is in there and the owner wants
value now. a lawsuit under ip has the power to bring down lots of
other stuff. this is a very plausible future under a licensing regime
but impossible under a normative regime.

2 the involuntary infringer is liable for damages under licenses, even
if she was not the person who removed attribution or sharealike
clauses two steps back in the data web. if there is monetary value to
be had, this is going to happen. endorsing open licenses = endorsing
enforcement, even is the intent is not to go to court. and if we don't
plan to go to court, why even allow the chance for this?

3. fragmentation. data disciplines vary much more than software. their
norms swing wildly, as do secondary regimes like privacy. creating the
idea that one or two licenses suffice doesn't reflect this - it will
force disciplines to choose between their norms and technolegal
interoperability. and if the norms all get encoded in their own
licenses we will indeed see fragmentation. this scenario also means
that cross discipline mashup will be legally difficult.

norms allow for formal encoding but informal punishment. this
flexibility, when we don't know how this will all play out, just seems
a more wise choice to me. it lets experimentation hapen without fear
of lawsuit, and lets each community encode its ideals without breaking
the power to integrate it al.

in geneal, my instinct is that it is fine if these things *look* like
licenses, as long as the enforcement is not in the courts. we create
enormous potential for negative effects by using ip and courts, for
little return. if i were evil i would be al over setting up a data
troll business, use some easter eggs, and sue for revenue in about
five years. makes patent trolling look like simple street robbery.

Hi All

I think we've come to the nub of the argument in as much as what we are
getting to is the gut response of each of us to licences. Rufus' perspective
I think comes out most in the paragraph

>> Let's be clear: most open licenses whether in software, content or
>> anywhere else aren't 'enforced' (and won't be enforced) by recourse to

The problem is - that as soon as you call it a license then scientists will
largely assume that is exactly what you are saying, and that will provoke a
strong negative response. Call it a protocol, call it a standard, and people
will feel comfortable. Hint that it is contractual and potentially
enforceable and we will do two things. First run in the opposite direction
and second ignore the terms /because/ it is a license.

I visited a university department yesterday and three people separately
freely stated that they had done something technically illegal or in breach
of contract, followed up by the statement "so sue me". Flouting of the rules
imposed by admin and legal people can be a badge of honour in many
scientific communities.

John's view, and to a certain extent mine are summed up by:

> in geneal, my instinct is that it is fine if these things *look* like
> licenses, as long as the enforcement is not in the courts. we create
> enormous potential for negative effects by using ip and courts, for
> little return. if i were evil i would be al over setting up a data

The issue here is not whether someone would actually do this - but that
scientists will immediately see the possibility and get disturbed by it.
Remember these are the people who assume that it is more likely that if they
make data available then someone will steal it, write up seventeen Nature
papers, and become a millionaire without crediting them, rather than someone
might make some modest use of it and credit them in the accepted way that we
generally do. 

It's an issue of control - if researchers feel they have ownership of this
protocol/standard then there will be fewer barriers to adoption. If there is
a perception that the protocol is "owned" by lawyers, which is what I
believe will happen if it is called a license, then there will be very
strong resistance. 

In my view our best chance of promoting best practice and "enforcement" is
through a protocol that funders choose to adopt for the research they
support. This is a much more powerful way of driving researcher behaviour
than through person to person contractual arrangements. I think this also
gives us the best chance of pushing through the idea that data and
collections of data should be explicitly placed in the public domain to
maximise the ability for re-use.

[Do we in fact agree on that incidentally? We haven't really touched on
whether we agree what the idea world would look like. I know Rufus feels
that share alike is acceptable but I don't know whether that means he thinks
it is on balance a good thing.]

[Is the mailing list published to web somewhere or should I repost this
somewhere? I'm very keen to keep the discussion out in the open as it were]

Am following with interest.  Agree very much with Cam:

> of this protocol/standard then there will be fewer barriers to 
> adoption. If there is a perception that the protocol is "owned"

So much as hint to a scientist that a lawyer might "take their work
away" and you have a fight on your hands.  Doesn't matter if the
perception is not accurate; it's very common (I'd say almost universal)
and likely to be very difficult to change.

Rufus says

> ...most open licenses whether in software, content or anywhere 
> else aren't 'enforced' (and won't be enforced) by recourse to
> the courts. [...]  Saying use licenses isn't saying: let's 
> settle all our disputes in courts!

and my immediate reaction is bullshit, that's exactly what it's saying!  

Then I stop to think about it, and realize that I can't think of more
than a couple of court cases involving open licenses.  My point here is
that, contrary to popular misconception, you won't get most scientists
to think beyond their immediate reaction, and evidence won't change
their minds.  Sad but true.

Cam again:

Funder *mandates* work -- the evidence from OA is strong.  Funder
suggestions or preferences or strong recommendations do NOT work --
again, evidence from OA.  If something is not a condition of taking the
money, it won't get done.

And Cam again:

> Do we in fact agree [that data and collections of data should be 
> explicitly placed in the public domain to maximise the ability for 
> re-use] ?

A central question.  We are all familiar with John Wilbanks' argument
for public domain, and I find it entirely persuasive so that's the way I
"vote".  

I suspect most working scientists would agree but perhaps that would be
a good question to approach empirically: question on FriendFeed to
start?


cheers,

B.

thanks to everyone who has contributed very useful and thoughtful  
discussion on this important topic!

The problem and the reason why licenses are needed, in my opnion, is  
not scientists, but rather commercial for-profit businesses.  I would  
argue that taking stuff that starts out free and selling it under  
locked-down conditions IS the norm.  This is fine is the original  
free version is there - but this will not always be the case.

For example, consider the OCLC takeover of OAIster, and OCLC's  
current view of IP and data.  If OCLC continues to keep up (including  
growing and developing) the free version of OAIster, all well and  
good, along with a toll-access version for OCLC customers, all well  
and good.  If, however, the free version is abandoned, or simply not  
kept up so that it becomes less and less useful, then people are in  
the position of giving away data for free, for someone else to profit  
on with no obligation to share themselves.

An appropriate sharealike-style license for data would likely prevent  
this situation, and if it did not, would give the free sharing  
community a legal means of stopping it.

The primary purpose of the licensing approach would not be to go to  
court or even to clarify the rules, but rather to clarify the  
expectation of sharing and so avoid the means to go to court.

See, e.g., the licensing slide at:

http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/floss-license-slide.html

Software created under (for example) the Apache, Mozilla and GPL2 licenses 
is all mutually incompatible, in the sense that code from one project 
can't be combined with code from another.  Instead of a commons, we're 
effectively seeing the construction of silos --- you may take freely from 
one silo, but once you've picked it, that's the end.

Another example which comes to mind is the saga of getting Wikipedia and 
CC into sync, now happily concluded:

http://lessig.org/blog/2008/11/enormously_important_news_from.html

The obvious response someone might give is to say "Well, we should make 
sure that kind of license proliferation doesn't happen in science."  But 
that's easier said than done, especially if licensing becomes a big issue. 
My instinct is to concentrate on norms, and keep the licensing side as 
simple as possible.

I'm not sure what you mean by "explicit community norms".

I'll just say that I agree with what John Wilbanks said here --- the

Interesting (to me at least!) that the concern that "a lawyer might
'take their work away'" doesn't appear to have been a problem in the
adoption of open licences for software?  Are scientists significantly
more wary of lawyers than programmers?  I suppose the difference is that
software space was already burdened with heavily protective licences and
that the introduction of open licences was perceived as a step in the
right direction, at least by those who like that kind of thing.

Similarly, in the cultural heritage space, it seems to me that any
slowness to move towards openness of digitised artifacts (for example)
is not caused by a concern that CC is codified as a set of 'licences' or
that lawyers might have been involved in their creation, rather with
more fundamental concerns about the impact of being 'open' on business
models and the like.

I confess, I haven't been able to follow this discussion in detail. Some of
the comments appeared to have a lot of intellectual gravity behind them, but
were simply too long for me to take in. Would anyone care to provide an
executive summary?

I may be off the mark, but I would argue that there's a general principle to
consider here. I hold that any data collected by public money should be made
freely available to the public, for any use that contributes to the public
good. Strikes me as a no-brainer, but of course - we have a long way to go.
If we accept this principle, the licensing follows.

By the way, this may be relevant:

Yishay, I am afraid it isn?t short but I?ve tried to summarise:
http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/2009/02/06/licenses-and-protoco
ls-for-open-science-the-debate-continues/

This is an important discussion that has been going on in disparate places,
but primarily at the moment is on the Open Science mailing list maintained
by the OKF. To try and keep things together and because Yishay Mor asked, I
thought I would try to summarize the current state of the debate.

The key aim here is to find a form of practice that will enhance data
availability, and protect it into the future.

There is general agreement that there is a need for some sort of declaration
associated with making data available. Clarity is important and the minimum
here would be a clear statement of intention.

Where there is disagreement is over what form this should take. Rufus
Pollock started by giving the reasons why this should be a formal license.
Rufus believes that a license provides certainty and clarity in a way that a
protocol, statement of principles, or expression of community standards can
not.  I, along with Bill Hooker and John Wilbanks [links are to posts on
mailing list], expressed a concern that actually the use of legal language,
and the notion of ?ownership? of this by lawyers rather than scientists
would have profound negative results. Andy Powell points out that this did
not seem to occur either in the Open Source movement or with much of the
open content community. But I believe he also hits the nail on the head with
the possible reason:

"I suppose the difference is that software space was already burdened with
heavily protective licences and that the introduction of open licences was
perceived as a step in the right direction, at least by those who like that
kind of thing."

Scientific data has a history of being assumed to be in public domain (see
the lack of any license at PDB or Genbank or most other databases) so there
isn?t the same sense of pushing back from an existing strong IP or licensing
regime. However I think there is broad agreement that this protocol or
statement would look a lot like a license and would aim to have the legal
effect of at least providing clarity over the rights of users to copy,
re-purpose, and fork the objects in question.

Michael Nielsen and John Wilbanks have expressed a concern about the
potential for license proliferation and incompatibility. Michael cites the
example of Apache, Mozilla, and GPL2 licenses. This feeds into the issue of
the acceptability, or desirability of share-alike provisions which is an
area of significant division. Heather Morrison raises the issue of dealing
with commercial entities who may take data and use technical means to
effectively take it out of the public domain, citing the takeover of OAIster
by OCLC as a potential example.

This is a real area of contention I think because some of us (including me)
would see this in quite a positive light (data being used effectively in a
commercial setting is better than it not being used at all) as long as the
data is still both legally and technically in the public domain. Indeed this
is at the core of the power of a public domain declaration. The issue of
finding the resources that support the preservation of research objects in
the (accessible) public domain is a separate one but in my view if we don?t
embrace the idea that money can and should be made off data placed in the
public domain then we are going to be in big trouble sooner or later because
the money will simply run out.

On the flip side of the argument is a strong tradition of arguing that viral
licensing and share alike provisions protect the rights and personal
investment of individuals and small players against larger commercial
entities. Many of the people who support open data belong to this tradition,
often for very good historical reasons. I personally don?t disagree with the
argument on a logical level, but I think for scientific data we need to
provide clear paths for commercial exploitation because using science to do
useful things costs a lot of money. If you want people want to invest in
using the outputs of publicly funded research you need to provide them with
the certainty that they can legitimately use that data within their current
business practice. I think it is also clear that those of us who take this
line need to come up with a clear and convincing way of expressing this
argument because it is at the centre of the objection to ?protection? via
licenses and share alike provisions.

Finally Yishay brings us back to the main point. Something to keep focussed
on:

"I may be off the mark, but I would argue that there?s a general principle
to consider here. I hold that any data collected by public money should be
made freely available to the public, for any use that contributes to the
public good. Strikes me as a no-brainer, but of course - we have a long way
to go. If we accept this principle, the licensing follows."

Obviously I don?t agree with the last sentence - I would say that dedication
to the public domain follows - but the principle I think is something we can
agree that we are aiming for.

thanks. excellent summary. just one clarification:
If I put my data on the web, with a note attached saying: "you are free to
use this data in any way you please." that, for me, is a license. A very
open, simple, public domain license. If I use data from any source, I want
to know the terms under which I am allowed to use it. That's why I want to
see a license statement.
I'm happy to see commercial exploitation of my work, as long as it doesn't
prohibit future non-commercial use, or future commercial use for that
matter.

I agree that this is an excellent summary of the discussion, although  
my point about commercial entities has at least as much to do with  
business practices as it does with technical means of suppression.   
That is, if a free service is made available through toll access and  
then the free service is not maintained, the public domain becomes  
effectively captured.  Unless the capturing entity has an obligation  
to at least release the data they received from the public domain.   
That is sharealike.

The idea of scholars writing simple notes to go with data has a lot  
of appeal for me.  This brings scholars themselves into the  
discussion, and allow norms to evolve from the community.

Public domain (including commercial use) makes sense to me for data;  
but it may be that the concept of public domain needs to evolve.   
What if I want to give my work to the public domain, including  
responsible / fair commercial use, but excluding exploitative use  
(such as locking up the public domain)?

As an example of where I would be concerned about norms of giving  
away work for the public domain, including commercial work:  This  
would mean that scholars in developing countries would give away  
their data, and companies could make use of the data to create  
products to sell, whether information products based on adding value  
to the research through data-mining, or products such as new drugs,  
etc.  This would be exploitative, and could potentially increase the  
economic divide.

I am sure exactly what the best approach to a solution is here.   
Norms for data that reflect a fair / responsible public domain - or  
is it the laws that regulate businesses that should require some  
elements of fairness / responsibility (or the triple bottom line)?

Because not planning does not mean it never happening (or the threat
of it happening not being important).

I also really don't understand the logic here. Court only happens due
to enforcement when people don't obey (and intentionally -- it is
extremely unlikely you are going to get in trouble for inadvertantly
failing to comply ...). I.e. it is important precisely when 'norms'
aren't cutting it ...

It seems to me that that the status of a the GPL as a license rather
than a norm has been important in getting compliance from some people
over time -- and more importantly in encouraging others to contribute
to GPL'd projects in the first place.

I am not sure I really buy this. Code gets used across a lot of different areas.

Plus we are not talking about the whole governance of a discipline but
data sharing. Moreover we are also only talking about encoding 'open'
data across disciplines (and the only things we are possibly allowing
away from PD is attribution and Share-alike).

But a) there is flexibility in licenses (look at attribution with CC

So I think we agree that whatever happens data access is going to be
covered by fairly formal documents that specify what you are supposed
to do. (So we should be clear that unlike most 'norms' these are going
to be fairly formalized).

Leaving aside the fact that there are going to patent-related issues
in this stuff anyway (pharma, business methods etc). Also I don't
understand how 'us' (the open data) community not using licenses and
IP prevents everyone else from doing so? If you are worried about
'trolling' in data then it is going to happen whether we use licenses
or norms or ....

What's weird to me is that I know scientists who seem quite happy with
putting CC licenses (open and non-open ones) on their blog or or
applying open-source licenses to their code. I'm interested why
people's attitudes on data are so different?

So we all agree that attribution (and perhaps share-alike) are going
to be wanted?

The question then is whether to put these 'requirements' in norms or
licenses ...

OK that this is a naming or institutional issue. We could name the proposal:

Open Data Standard and License

Also I must emphasize: even if you want PD you're going to have to
apply that is (or looks really like) a license since there are DB
rights in a whole bunch of places ...

I feel this is a related but distinct (and v. important) issue: how do
we encourage 'open' data in sciences?

I think your suggestion of driving this is via a protocol but this is
distinct of what people actually do to make their data open. The
license/norms are the way we define what is open. That is we need:

1) definition of how people make their data open (~ publish it
somewhere and apply appropriate license/norm/...)

2) Encouragement (probably from funders) for scientists to use this mechanism.

I am ambiguous about share-alike. Personally, for my own stuff, I tend
to the 'MIT/BSD' end of the spectrum (i.e. attribution only with no
share-alike). However, I know people/communities where formal/informal
share-alike is pretty important.

What I mean is that in 14 years, a lawsuit can be filed under a license that
can bring down significant federations of data into which that data was
integrated. That lawsuit cannot be filed under a normative system - if a
community wants to punish one of its own members it can do so using its own
systems, but the legal status of the data web is secure.

You're assuming good actors use the open licenses. I'm assuming all kinds of
actors use them. It's so hard to figure out where copyright stops and starts
in a database that it's pretty easy to see scenarios where people assume the
human genome is copyrighted, or map data is copyrighted, and sue for failed
attribution. The strict liability nature of copyright is a real problem
here. We're not talking anything like software, where you *have* to have
copyright licenses. We're choosing to put them in places where they don't
natively belong. And what we are doing is creating a world in which this
kind of lawsuit is plausibly predictable. Why? Given that the data licenses
are much less enforceable from a copyright perspective than the software
licenses (again due to the underlying nature of the content) why is this
worth the so easily seen risk?

Stallmann and Mako taught me this. If you can enable an evil use with your
tools, you are obliged to contemplate it. It's an important aspect at all
times. PD + norms mean that someone can take a copy of a database private,
and they don't have to share their stuff under the law. But they also mean
that anyone else in the world can keep a copy of that database online and
public. No one's use can enclose anyone else's use for any purpose and bad
actors can't sue when they suddenly realize there's a valuable data web.

Remember that every google query in a data web is a derivative data product,
and attribution will be legally required with preliminary injunction power
available to every searched database under a license scheme. That's the
outcome of licensing choices.

Stallman had no choice but to use copyrights. We have a choice. He had to
break down a culture of closure. We have a culture of openness. We have a
chance to do things differently, to not built a world based on ideas of
control and contract, to encode a world that in many ways already exists.

Physicists have different norms than biologists, who have different norms
than anthropologists. Trust me, not everyone in science is going to use a
map license. Choosing the encoding of norms in contract in the sciences
essentially guarantees that we will have legal fragmentation, because the
norms differ wildly across the disciplines.

Code is different. It gets used all over the place, but the invisible
college of programming connects the writers. The norms of programming are
encoded in the licenses. But the clinical research scientist and the high
energy physicist and the chemist and the biologist and the sensor-net
geospatial scientist...well, they're different. And if their norms get
encoded in law, and in different kinds of share alike, the kind of data
integration we need for climate change is going to be a hell of a lot
harder.

That's what *you* are endorsing. But by endorsing licenses, you can bet a
lot of other licenses are going to be created with non commercial terms and
more. It's kind of hard to criticize the incremental changes in licenses
when you've endorsed the idea that we should encode norms in licenses,
because then what you're doing is saying your norms are better than mine.
Fragmentation.

In reality this doesn't get used. Non compliance in data to me is a feature,
not a bug. I want a million kinds of data mashup a lot more than I want
control. That's what it's going to take to deal with climate change and
human health.

Absolutely. SC is actually going to prepare a formal norms document that
looks and feels like a CC license, will have metadata, etc., that will
encode attribution (though we're changing the name to citation to avoid the
legal implications of attribution in a copyright sense) and share-alike
(though we'll also change the name for the same reason). It will simply be
empty in the middle.

Trolling can't happen on PD data. We can't fix the patent problem in
copyright or data licenses, sadly - disclosure and crowd review of prior art
is the best way i've seen - but if we can create a zone of unambiguously
free data, and use metadata to exclude unfree data, then trolling is
*eliminated*. You can't use a PD assertion on data and then sue for failed
attribution. That's the fundamental benefit as I see it...

Really nice summary Cameron (and I probably should have responded

seems to have a gone a little awry -- my apologies for overburdening
the list).

Let's be really clear: everyone will need to apply a license (or
something very close) even if they are just making stuff PD (because
they need to formally waive whatever rights they have).

The remaining question is: will attribution and share-alike (if

Is this really the case? Talking with e.g. Peter Murray-Rust about
what goes on Chemistry it seems to me there is a fair amount of
keeping data proprietary (and charging for it).

I'd also ask: isn't it likely that the future is going to see data
combined from a wider variety of areas? (Isn't that one of the reasons
we're having this debate). If so then maybe scientists need to think
not just about 'scientific' data but also about geodata or weather
data etc and many these areas are already heavily commercial (and
usually not open)

It's true that Bioinformatics seems pretty advanced on the openness
front we should note that this wasn't just by default but due to some
pretty serious, and explicit, effort (I've seen Tim Hubbard present a
few times here on the race between Celera and the Human Genome
project).

So what happens when you get incompatibility of 'norms'. Does
'flexibility' mean I can just ignore the norms as I see fit?

Let's be clear: 'open' data must permit commercial use. Non-commercial
restrictions whether for content, code or data make the associated
material *not open*. See item 8 of:

<http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0>

I, for one, think it is really important to the long term viability of
the open data community, whether in science or other domains, that
business can get involved.

I couldn't agree more though I am not sure how this relates to the PD
or licensing issue. Business has got involved with share-alike (GPL'd)
software (cf. Linux) and it seems to me that the most crucial thing
for business will be clarity and certainty which may, in fact, be
easier to supply with licenses rather than norms.

[snip]

Let's be really clear then: share-alike and attribution are both
compatible with commercial use (look at software!).

Also what's the license/norms distinction here: surely if the norms
include attribution or share-alike terms you expect them to be
observed by businesses? If so this question seems more about whether
attribution or share-alike are allowed *at all* not whether they are
encoded in licenses or norms.

But we are talking about data, not stuff in general; data are a very
specific kind of stuff.

I thought the native state of data was public domain.  Copyright does
not inhere in facts, and patents have to be applied for to be got, so
why would you have to license data to make it public domain?  Surely
just making it available serves that purpose?  The point of a norm or
statement (or even a license) placing it in the public domain is only to
make it *unambiguously* available to everyone, forever.

Moreover, waiving one's rights doesn't seem to me to be "very close" to
a license at all.  Licenses exert control, waivers do away with it.

Another question: are attribution and share-alike compatible with public
domain?  The distinction seems pretty clear to me (BY and SA both take
something OUT of the public domain, right?), but is becoming blurry in
this discussion.

best,

Bill.

If that's true, then it's not a norm.  You pay a price for norm violation 
-- e.g., the price paid by people who violate norms by plagiarizing other 
people's work.  Of course, that price can only be extracted on people who 
are inside the community where the norm is in force; people outside that 
community can flout the norm largely with impunity.

An example of the kind of norm incompatability you're talking about occurs 
in cross-disciplinary field, when the different fields have different 
norms.  To pick an example I've seen up close, in the theoretical computer 
science community authors on papers are usually ordered alphabetically by 
surname.  In theoretical physics, author ordering is used to convey 
information about contribution, and it can be very important (sometimes 
the deciding factor, in extreme cases) for jobs etc.  This norm 
incompatability can cause considerable difficulties when people from the 
two communities collaborate.  Much though certainly not all of that 
difficulty can be overcome by negotiation.

In the United States, this is true. In Europe, "database rights"
complicate the issue considerably. I strongly recommend taking a look
at the last chapter of James Boyle's new book _The Public Domain_ for
a straightforward explanation. <http://www.thepublicdomain.org/>

As part of a license, no. As part of a set of norms, yes.

Dear All

I was working on a half baked blog post which I think is superseded by a lot
of what others have written this afternoon. But I thought the following
might still be useful:

[wanting to define terms]

By ?public domain? I mean placed legally into the domain of works for which
any, copying, re-use or re-purposing is allowed without any restrictions.
While some objects are naturally in the public domain placing a ?work? in
the public domain usually requires a dedication of some sort or a disavowal
of any or all rights that the producer of the work may have. The Public
Domain Dedication protocol is an example of such. So placing data in the
public domain does not simply mean making it public, it means placing it in
a legal state where anyone is free to do whatever they like with it.

By ?license? I mean some form of contractual arrangement between the
provider of data and the user of data, such as a copyright notice,
declaration of database rights, or ?click wrap? agreement. As Yishay pointed
out in comments to my last post, a Public Domain Dedication looks quite a
lot like a license. However I don't think of it as such because a PDD
removes the need to give or seek permissions at all, removing the need for
any contractual arrangement between users and provider.

By ?data? I mean collections of data. As Jonathon Rochkind pointed out and
as we should all remember, a specific datum itself is in the public domain
by its nature. A fact of nature is not subject to copyright or intellectual
property law. Collections of data, and presentations of data, however can
acquire potential database or ?sweat of the brow? rights in certain
jurisdictions. It might be advisable for us to use the singular and plural
to draw the distinction. The line between a datum and data that defines when
these rights might be acquired is a difficult one, even for lawyers to
define, and this confusion forms part of the argument for public domain
dedication.

> Let's be really clear: everyone will need to apply a license (or
> something very close) even if they are just making stuff PD (because
> they need to formally waive whatever rights they have).

Agreed - either way there is a formal statement. I've not been thinking of
this as a license per se for the reasons above.
 
> The remaining question is: will attribution and share-alike (if
> included at all) be in licenses or in norms?

For me, share-alike only makes sense in the context of a license because it
only has any value if you can enforce it. As Michael has said community
enforcement of norms can only be through exclusion from the community. The
point of share-alike is to force people who would otherwise not to use the
same protocol/licence. Without a contractual arrangement there isn't any
real means of forcing people who choose to act outside the community.

But I also wonder whether we're actually worrying about something that isn't
very important. I think we are all agreed that non-commercial clauses are
not acceptable for legal, practical, and philosophical reasons. But this is
where the real battle is going to lie, not share-alike, which I don't think
most scientists would even have heard of. Looking at e.g. the licenses on
databases in the Nucleic Acids Research database issue you will see a
multitude of (probably unenforceable and certainly incompatible) licenses.
But virtually all of them have non-commercial clauses.

I wonder if our energies are better spent making that case and just
shuffling share-alike under the carpet. If we generally don't think its all
that helpful, and if I am right that most scientists won't care that much
(which remains to be seen) is it worth getting that stressed about?
  
[snipped - will aim to deal with this separately]

> I, for one, think it is really important to the long term viability of
> the open data community, whether in science or other domains, that
> business can get involved.

Absolutely agree but there is a strong sense of "anti-commercial" sentiment
within some parts of the open content movement and I think the current crop
of licences being applied to scientific databases also show an
anti-commercial attitude (or at least an "I want to make that money"
attitude). I want to come back to Heather's example of a commercial interest
exploiting the results of third world scientists at some point, but I think
there is something interesting there in about the way we use "exploit" as a
positive or negative term. This is a crucial argument to get right and
watertight. Particularly as making useful stuff from scientific results is
generally very expensive so profits have to be available to encourage it.

I agree that they are separate questions with the caveat that I think that
if you dedicate to the public domain then a "share-alike norm" is
meaningless. Citation norms will work because people placing work in the
community view will want to be seen as members of the community. Which
obviously I don't see as much of a loss ;-)

Thankyou for that, Cameron.  I have a tiny little nitpick:

On Mon, 9 Feb 2009, Neylon wrote:

I didn't quite mean to imply that.  Enforcement can be through other means 
as well.  Simple disapproval from others is a pretty strong disincentive. 
That doesn't necessarily translate into exclusion from the community, just 
lower status (and possibly lower pay, reduced possibility of receiving 
grants, etc).

Cheers,

Michael

Dear John,

Thanks for your clarifications/comments. I've responded inline below
in the usual fashion. I wanted to pose a couple of specific questions
to focus the discussion but since this post (and thread) is getting a
little long I think I am going to send them separately.

Just to be clear: you mean the legal status is secure if everyone has
correctly licensed/dedicated their stuff to the PD.

Also I really am not convinced that allowing attribution is going to
lead to 'significant federations of data' being 'brought down'.

Imagine I come along and say: 'hey you are not attributing me'

All I need to to do comply is to add that attribution and everything
is fine. (I'd also note that even in the norms case,  where were no
'formal' obligation, the data holder would probably want to comply
with this kind of thing).

But this just isn't true. There are rights in data all over the place
(and even in the US it is debatable -- Feist doesn't remove

I think I should reiterate an earlier distinction I suggested between:

1. What we allow as 'open' data
2. What we recommend

Saying sharealike and attribution should be allowed for open stuff is
not the same as saying it is recommended (I personally use MIT/BSD
type stuff for what I do but I know people who really like GPL ...)

Re your specific risk point: I see the risk as low (esp. for
attribution) and benefits as significant.

I think the concern is less about not sharing the db itself as
modifications and improvements to it.

Again I come back to the recommendation versus permit option (or: you
don't have to use attribution and share-alike if you don't want).

Suppose we permit share-share-alike and attribution. Users of data
will have options of using PD data, attribution data and share-alike
data. If attribution or share-alike is a real risk for users they can
and will choose PD data. (Likely leading to PD being the default and
SA and Attribution withering away :) )

My understanding -- though I may be wrong -- was that he also wanted
more: to ensure that what he did wasn't 'closed' (and keeping hist own
'individual' patch set 'PD' would not have been enough: he needed that
those who took his work and built upon it also gave back).

Woah there :) I feel things are getting a bit inverted:

We all agree that open (however done) will mean freedom to use, reuse
and redistribute however you want subject to (at most) 2 reservations:

1. Attribution
2. Share-alike

While I agree that allowing reservations involves more 'control' than
pure PD I think we are very long way from the control and contract of
the standard system.

But are we encoding the norms of the disciplines or what people can do
with some data. While, of course, these two items may be related they
are a long way from being the same.

The creation of data licenses with NC or other terms has happened (and
is going to go on) happening whatever we do. By specifying what we
mean by open (whether in norms and licenses) and encoding that in some
way is going very little different.

I also don't agree that we can't keep a decent, and clear, line here.

Dealing with climate change is more about politics that .... but
that's a separate matter ;)

I agree that we want freedom more than we want control (was I arguing
otherwise?) but this discussion is about something different:

a) Should the open data (in science) community include those who wish
to use share-alike or attribution
b) Should it include those who use licenses rather than norms

E.g. it's one thing for me to just use norms for my open stuff if I
want to but I don't see why others can't use a license if they want.

I know Jordan's already got something at:

Perhaps that's usable already -- if not any comments on modifications

Possibly-ignorant questions about share-alike:

I am a social science researcher. I do a human-subjects study,
properly anonymize the dataset, and publish it under a share-alike
license.

My colleague at another institution then protests that she can't use
the dataset because she will be combining her own human-subjects work
with it, and her IRB insists that such datasets as hers not be
published at all, even anonymized, owing to questions of privacy.

Is this a plausible scenario? If so, is it what we want?

No, things aren't that simple ... See this guide to open data
licensing we prepared a couple of years ago

http://okfn.org/wiki/OpenDataLicensing

especially the section on "What Legal (IP) Rights Are There in Data
(and Databases)".

I quite understand your point but a license can also be a way of just
allowing people to do stuff. As (I think) Yishay said earlier a
statement such as:

"You can take this stuff and do whatever you want with it"

is a license.

OK, this is maybe where confusion comes in. For open stuff by a
license I just mean a document that says:

"You're free to do all of this stuff without asking any kind of permission"

subject to, at most, requirement to attribute or share-alike.
Furthermore, I would insist that the license should impose zero burden
on users (other than perhaps attribution or share-alike) so no
'click-wrap' type stuff should be allowed. (See item 9 of
http://www.opendefinition.org/1.0/).

Declarations of e.g. copyright or db rights do not need to be in a license.

Quite right. I've now posted one of the appendices I mentioned originally at:

Though this problem exists elsewhere (though perhaps less severely).
If I copy the structure but not the letter of someone's code am I
infringing etc etc.

Yes though we might imagine this community's views having some degree
of force. For example, one might want to participate in this community
in which case share-alike requirements on a given dataset might matter
(even in norms).

*100% agree with this and your points below* (snipped for brevity!).
Non-commercial restrictions are a major issue and I think it is very
important that makes things non-open (this is not saying
non-commercial is per se bad by the way but it is saying when building
the open data commons that non-commercial restrictions is not
compatible with 'openness' of data).

I would agree but I would be unhappy to have it excluded especially
since some major data communities are using it (e.g. Open Street Map).

It might be what we want.  This gives the researcher incentive to  
investigate whether her data can indeed be anonymized and protect  
privacy, and if so, to convince her IRB to change the policy.

Another question for this scenario:  if the first researcher is  
making data freely available and other researchers are using it and  
not sharing theirs, is this is disincentive for researchers to openly  
share their data?  In my opinion, it is.  At the very least, it is a  
good reason to delay sharing your data until after you publish, or  
someone makes you.  Otherwise, a second researcher - with access to  
your data, with no effort, plus more than you have - could easily  
publish before you.

In the ideal world ~ which I think we should be aiming for ~ there  
will be much more cooperation and less competition, even in science,  
so this might not matter at all.  In today's environment, though,  
this scenario could mean the researcher who freely shares (but not  
sharealike) is at a disadvantage when it comes to competing for jobs,  
research grants, and awards.

Everyone has their "scooping" horror story or ten, but the only
real-life Open Science efforts I know of (Bradley, Neylon) are textbook
examples of finding collaborators who would otherwise have never been
reachable, and have had no problem whatsoever with bad actors.  

That is, if we're taking competition into account, the evidence to date
is that sharing makes a researcher *more*, not less, competitive.  More
such evidence is probably the best way to encourage a culture of
sharing/use of the public domain in research.

Message-ID: <40206B04-189F-4381-A5EF-3FBFA88C90AC@eln.bc.ca>

The idea of norms rather than licenses does have some appeal.

Question:  can a normative approach accomodate things like flexible  
understandings of what is permitted, and allow for evolution of such  
understandings?

Flexible understandings = stuff like friendly licenses.  To go back  
to Dorothea's example, if one researcher shares data freely while a  
second researcher cannot share for privacy reasons, there are  
probably a few understandings that the first researcher would think  
of as friendly to sharealike.  For example, if the second researcher  
shares her data privately with the first researcher, and publishes  
her results OA immediately on acceptance for publication, the first  
researcher may well be satisfied that this is Sharealike.

Or, if a company take data from a third world researcher who uses  
"noncommercial-sharealike" and uses it to develop a new drug, makes a  
huge profit in the developed world, and uses some of this profit to  
a) distribute the drug for free in the researcher's home country and  
b) provides the researcher with some grant money to conduct further  
research, then it seems possible that this researcher would consider  
this completely friendly, even if the company has a patent and does  
not release the results of their own research.

One reason I think we need flexible understandings is that our world- 
view in this type of matter need to evolve in a globalized online  
world, for two reasons:  1.  there are many different ways of  
understanding concepts like ownership in the world, never mind  
intellectual property.  In some cultures, this is a silly concept;  
there are those in the western world who share this view and 2.  it  
will take some time to think through what this new online world can  
be, and hence, what makes the most sense for sharing.  In the  
interim, we need to experiment, with a variety of things with  
Creative Commons, GNU licensing, and just plain free sharing being  
the very best of the experiments we have, for the moment.

Just to be clear: I take this to mean vis-a-vis stuff like share-alike
(I think we are all agreed now that we need a 'license' whatever you
do -- i.e. some formal statement regarding the material (even if that
is PD dedication))

> Question:  can a normative approach accomodate things like flexible

> understandings?

While I understand the attractiveness of such flexibility I am
concerned it starts to blur into fuzziness. One of the major reasons
for making stuff open is to remove the permissions barrier: I can use
stuff without having to go and consult with its producer.

Once norms become fuzzy either we start requiring significant efforts
from users or we end up with the norms being ignored -- and neither
outcome seems attractive.

I think this example is an interesting one (and I believe John
Wilbanks has raised it before in discussions -- though not in this
thread).

I take your point here about flexibility but I do think both ways: in
the example you give the user of open data (i.e. the first researcher)
is having to do quite a lot of thinking regarding what they are
supposed to do to comply with the 'spirit' of the norms. In a world in
which data sharing (we hope) is going to happen *a lot* I think this
could get a bit burdensome.

On a point more directly related to the original example we should
also be clear about what share-alike means here.

If the first researcher is just using the data 'internally' to do
calculations and then publishing a paper using those calculations
share-alike isn't going to come into it: they are not producing *and*
distributing a derivative 'database' (of course attribution still
'binds' ...). Thus, sharealike will only come into it if you are
making a 'derived' database and publicly distributing *that*.

Rufus

Would it make sense for norms for open data to be expressed as codes  
of practice?  Perhaps different groups (disciplinary, regional etc.)  
could each have their own codes of practice.  This would allow for  
real-world experimentation, in a way that lets each group move  
forward in the way they are most comfortable with, without the legal  
messiness of licensing being attached to each datum / dataset.   
Within academia, it seems to me that this leaves enforcement with the  
academics themselves.  Simply using someone else's data without  
attribution and without adding value is a lot like plagiarism, for  
example.

A code of practice could easily accomodate the kinds of things I see  
as desirable about noncommercial and sharealike, without hard-coding  
licensing terms in a way that prevents use of the data.  One way to  
develop such codes of practice in a way that helps steer us towards a  
more inclusive global world, could be to involve Without Borders-type  
groups in the early stages of developing potential codes of  
practice.  Even a simple statement in such a code along the lines of,  
"in our discipline / lab / country, we share our data openly.  All  
that we ask in return is that you respect this open sharing by  
ensuring that any commercial products or services made possible by  
this data are provided in a way that is fair and responsible for the  
people of the planet, and sustainable for the environment".

This approach gives leadership to the development of norms to  
scholars themselves - in the long run, in my opinion, this has value  
in and of itself.  This would not be a quick fix for every  
discipline, although there is nothing here to stop those in areas  
like environment science from forging ahead quickly.

I'm trying to hold back a bit, as I have made my arguments again and 
again. I also want to make sure everyone knows that I'm having these 
arguments in the spirit of finding common ground, and I have enormous 
respect for Rufus and his positions here.

But I wanted to say that this below is precisely what we mean by norms 
at SC.

jtw
ps - are there any communities other than OSM looking for share alike? 
I've not found any, but it'd be good to know. I know OSM actually is 
paying for the creation of the license, and that OSM is getting a fork 
to create a PD version already...

The Open Knowledge Conference (OKCon) is back for its fourth installment
bringing together individuals and groups from across the open knowledge
spectrum for a day of discussions workshops.

This year the event will feature dedicated sessions on 'open knowledge
and development' and 'open data and the semantic web'. In addition we
are reserving a substantial part of the event for the 'Open Space'-
sessions, workshops and discussions proposed either via the call for
proposals or on the day.

Interested in giving a paper? Have a project to talk about? Want to run
a workshop or session? Please see the call for proposals:

I have a hypothesis: open science (and open anything) drives innovation. It
is probably the best bet in terms of getting us out of the current economic
jam. Now, here's a chance to prove it. Anyone interested?


"The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), in funding partnership
with the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), the
National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) and the
Technology Strategy Board (TSB), is commissioning independent,
multidisciplinary research focused on the role, drivers and impact of
innovation."

Invitation to submit full proposals

The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), in funding partnership with
the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS), the National
Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) and the Technology
Strategy Board (TSB), is commissioning independent, multidisciplinary
research focused on the role, drivers and impact of innovation.

As the first phase of the Initiative, The Cambridge-Imperial Innovation
Research Centre (UK~IRC) is receiving funding to host a strategic research
and capacity building programme together with a knowledge exchange hub. As
the second phase of the Initiative, the partners are now commissioning
distributed projects. The Call is divided into two types of projects.

   1. Substantive research projects with a Full Economic Costing (FEC)
   between ?250,000 and ?600,000.
   2. Exploratory projects up to a maximum value of ?50,000 (FEC) per
   project.

A total of ?1.5 million is available for this call. Full applications for
the substantive research projects and the exploratory projects are invited.
Any UK organisation that is eligible for funding from any of the funding
organisations (ESRC, DIUS, NESTA and TSB) is eligible to apply.
Submitting an application

The deadline for receipt of applications is 4.00pm on 26 March 2009.

this is not part of the argument over what to *do* with databases, but 
the beginning of a set of posts about the legal background.

mike is on the board of CC, for disclosure's sake. he's a law professor 
at American University in DC, and he was involved in the early stages of 
the original CC licenses back in 2001. this post covers US copyright and 
databases.

i was recently challenged to provide a "slogan" for data and the best i 
could do was "it's complicated" - unsatisfying, but at least moderately 
accurate.

Thanks for the link John. This is a great post. I'd agree that it's
complex but so's copyright generally -- not just when applied to DBs.

Of course that's why we all agree that making things clear and simple
is so important -- though I know there are some (relatively small in
my view) differences on how to do that :)
