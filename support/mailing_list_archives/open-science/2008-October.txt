Subject: [open-science] Workshop on Finding and Re-using Open Scientific
	Resources
Message-ID: <48EE2231.7020600@okfn.org>

Hi all,

We're putting together a workshop on Finding and Re-using Open 
Scientific Resources in London this November. It would be great if some 
of you could make it!

  * When: Saturday 8th November 2008, 1100-1600
  * Where: London Knowledge Lab, 23-29 Emerald Street, London, WC1N 3QS.
(see map http://ur1.ca/87q)
  * Wiki: http://okfn.org/wiki/PublicInformation
  * Participation: Attendance is free. If you are planning to come along
please add your name to the participants list on the wiki page, or email us!

 From wiki page:

 > This informal, hands-on workshop will focus on finding and re-using 
open scientific resources - including open and public domain data, open 
access journal articles, and open educational materials. We will look at 
existing tools for discovering open material, metadata standards for 
relevant material in different domains, and how researchers go about 
looking for the material they need.

 > In addition to focused discussions about legal and technological 
aspects of re-use, open scientific resources will be documented and 
tagged on CKAN, a registry of knowledge resources.

Warm regards,

Jonathan Gray
The Open Knowledge Foundation
