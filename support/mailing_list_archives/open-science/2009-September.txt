CC0 endorsed in Nature opinion piece

September 9th, 2009 by Kaitlin Thaney

A new opinion piece in Nature on post-publication sharing of tools
explicitly recommends open sharing and the use of CC0 to put data in
the public domain. The special issue of Nature focuses on data sharing
and is now online and accessible free of charge.

The piece ?Post-publication sharing of data and tools? comes out of
this year?s CASIMIR conference in Rome, and discusses the sharing of
biological materials, specifically but not limited to mice and
embryonic stem cells.

As you may recall, we initially wrote about this meeting back in June,
following the publication of a similar opinion piece calling for
better and more efficient sharing practices for physical materials.
That article also stemmed from this meeting in Rome.

This opinion piece takes those ideas one step further in the
discussion to a formal recommendation for open sharing under the least
restrictive terms possible.

?[T]he Rome meeting strongly encouraged sharing behaviours that
promote a ?research commons?. The heart of a research commons is one
in which academic research is not impeded by restrictions on use and
access to data and materials, in line with the principles of the
Creative Commons.?

The piece is chock-full of stellar recommendations that Science
Commons supports, from better and more explicit resource sharing
policies at journals and funding bodies, to the use of standard MTAs,
to making data open and putting it in the public domain using CC0, our
public domain waiver.

?Although it is usual practice for major public databases to make data
freely available to access and use, any restrictions on use should be
strongly resisted and we endorse explicit encouragement of open
sharing, for example under the newly available CC0 public domain
waiver of Creative Commons.?

We highly encourage a deeper read of the article for more tips on how
to share resources more efficiently, as well as giving this article a
read for more on pre-publication data sharing.

Subject: [open-science] Finding data on funded research
Message-ID: <4AB914A7.3030604@gavinbaker.com>

This is outside my expertise, so I thought I'd ask here:

How easy is it to find information on funded research projects (e.g. by
research agencies and foundations)?

It seems to me that taxpayers (or foundations' donors) have a right to
easily find out what research they're funding, from award through
research outputs. This also seems like useful information for other
researchers, especially prior to publication -- e.g. to minimize
duplication, facilitate potential collaboration, etc.

How good -- or how bad -- is current transparency in this area? What
could be improved? What (if any) are the obstacles to openness?

I'm reminded of the issue because of recent announcements by two U.S.
research funders of new tools to search their grants:

http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/09/new-transparency-tool-on-nih-funded.html
http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/2009/09/new-database-of-neh-funded-projects.html

But I have little context about how novel these tools are or their
strengths/weaknesses. What do you think?

Gavin -

There are various resources, but it is not a totally open area. 

One subscription product is the Community of Science funded research database. Their help page has a bit of info, but you need a username/password to access the database itself.
http://fundedresearch.cos.com/helpdocs/userguide.shtml

In the UK there is the NIHR Clinical Research Network Portfolio:
http://www.ukcrn.org.uk/index/clinical/portfolio_new.html

MRC has its portfolio online:
http://www.mrc.ac.uk/ResearchPortfolio/index.htm

as do other UK Research Councils, e.g.:
http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/
http://www.bbsrc.ac.uk/science/grants/index.html
http://www.esrcsocietytoday.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/AdvancedSearchPage1.aspx

There are also various clinical trial registries, e.g.

Message-ID: <C6DF8345.7A46%cameron.neylon@stfc.ac.uk>

In the UK (and I think in the US as well) most funders will publish an
abstract of funded research proposals. Often this is the abstract referred
to as a "public understanding" or similar rather than the detailed
scientific abstract. The exact milestones or intended outcomes are never
published. 

This actually came up in a recent US case where there were two examples of
someone trying to get information on funded grant applications via an FOI
request. In one case the intent was (allegedly) slightly dodgy but in the
other it was to provide information on a range of funded proposals for a
research project.

Absolutely agree with the attitude you're expressing here but this would be
fought tooth and nail by the vast majority of academic researchers.

When it comes to outcomes the situation is slightly better in the UK because
we are supposed to submit papers to UKPMC and to link those to funded
grants. How much this happens in practice is anyone's guess - finger in the
wind I would guess around 5% compliance - which is what was seen in the US
when the NIH requested submission to PMC. When Wellcome/Nature offer to do
the leg work that rises to about 40% but I'm not sure how much metadata
about grants that gets tied to.

So overall - very little information on this is actually made public. My
opinion is that we are sleep walking into a public relations disaster with
this.

Cheers

Cameron

Dear colleagues,

The following half-day data curation event at Oxford may be of interest to some
of you:

DATA CURATION WORKSHOP: FROM LAB TO REUSE

Date: 14 October, starting at 1030 and finishing with lunch at 1300.

Location: Rewley House, 1 Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JA

Further information: <http://eidcsr.oucs.ox.ac.uk/workshop.xml>

Description

This workshop is organized as part of the dissemination activities of
the JISC-funded EIDCSR Project<http://eidcsr.oucs.ox.ac.uk>. The aim of
the workshop is to hear about proven practice in selected data
management areas identified as challenging for researchers through the
EIDCSR audit and requirements analysis exercise,
<http://eidcsr.blogspot.com/2009/09/data-audit-and-requirements-analysis.html>.


Whilst the EIDCSR Project is addressing the requirements of researchers
working within medical and life sciences, the event is likely to be of
interest to those working in, or supporting, other disciplinary areas.

The expected audience includes researchers who generate data in labs and
computing simulations and staff from service units with an interest in
research data management and curation issues.

Outcomes

Participants in the workshop will have the opportunity to learn about,
and contribute to discussion of, the different approaches to the
ensuring the flow of data between laboratory and in silico
experimentation. In particular, the workshop will discuss:

? ?* methods for the capture, storage and reuse of metadata in the
laboratory;
? ?* lifecycles integrating wet lab and in silico experimental data;
? ?* for delivery and visualisation of large-scale data.

Programme

Speakers include:

* Alan Garny, Oxford Department of Physiology Anatomy and Genetics -
Alan will discuss his research group data management workflow and
challenges.

* Brian Brooks, Unilever Cambridge Centre for Molecular Informatics -
Brian will talk about their Chemical Laboratory Repository In/Organic
Notebooks (CLARION) Project.

* Angus White, Digital Curation Centre - Angus will share the
experiences from the DCC SCARP Project on data management best practice.

* Aaron Griffiths, Research Information Network - Aaron will present the
findings from the RIN disciplinary case studies in life sciences

* Chris Goodyer, School of Computing - University of Leeds will describe the
work to develop a 3D visualization of MRI data and the potential to use this
experience to access the raw data by navigating the 3D model.
