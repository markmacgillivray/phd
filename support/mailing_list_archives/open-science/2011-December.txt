Hey Jenny!

Might one of you be able to add this new Portugese translation to the
Panton Principles site? Perhaps if you're busy you could show Laura
Newman how to do it - and blog on science.okfn.org?

J.

Hi,

Very happy to do this. It would be great if someone could give me
instructions how and then I can manage translations in future if you like :)

Thanks,
Laura

Fantastic!

That's fine, I'll do it over the weekend, it doesn't take long because I
have a wp code template now, I just copy and paste the text in.
Thanks very much Vinicius, Carolina and Tom!

Just to mention, I'm in Rio de Janeiro from 14 Dec - 2 Jan and would love
to meet any people form OKFN Brazil (particularly who are interested in
open science!) if you know of anyone in the area! :)

Message-ID: <CAD2k14Nb6izLspZmd7gC3kUuPsE5O_FixGdBVn=Tn6dFWzfp+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Jenny has highlighted that we shall be using this list to discuss the
hackathon. I suggest we use a separate title for each thread, prefaced by
HACKATHON-

My problem is how to create indentiers for (say) viruses. If you look at
Wikipedia it doesn't give IDs. But I then discovered (by chance) taxid:
which gives numbers. But the pages don't give static URIs (they contain
cgi). I am cutting and pasing the discussion (and I shal;l refer any others
to here.

Jerven Bollema


Hi Peter, All,

All taxons in the UniProt taxonomy can be found via (
http://purl.uniprot.org/taxonomy/10305). This is synchronized with the NCBI
taxonomy and is the same in the public version (release delta excepted).
Some limited NCBI taxonomy curation happens at the Swiss-Prot group which
also does the UniProt rdf work (Guess where I work ;).

In this case you actually have an link in rdf from the herpes virus to its
hosts. The proteins it encodes (might not be all for each virus isolate
e.g. in this case only a single virion membrane protein is known) and links
to relevant papers as well as related virion proteins.
Will love to show you all how you can get this data in RDF and work with it
using SPARQL.

Regards,
Jerven

Dear Peter and Jerven,

Nice blog with dawg and frog!

Thanks for the answer Jerven. I'm looking forward to this.

My apologies if this is tangential, but I came late to this conversation on taxonomy and am trying to reconstruct the thread.

I work on the team that manages paleodb.org which maintains the taxonomic information of fossils. I am working on a new architecture for an application that will offer paleodb's taxonomic information RESTfully and compliant with all the current best practices.

Perhaps a separate list would be worthwhile to discuss/share ideas on creating taxonomy applications.

Puneet --

Just some relevant pointers... I'm sure you've already come across the TDWG
(Taxonomic Databases Working Group) standards for publishing biological
taxonomies, names, and concepts, such as the Taxonomic Concept Transfer
Schema (TCS; http://www.tdwg.org/standards/117/).  Also relevant are
implementations of semantic concept linking at http://taxonconcept.org, as
well as more traditional links to taxon names through the Global Names
Index (GNI; http://www.globalnames.org/)?

PS I was involved in discussions about paleodb.org when Alroy first
launched it at NCEAS; I'm happy to see its had such longevity and is
supporting such an effective open data community.

Thanks for the links Matt. I am learning a lot of new stuff (I am really a computers/semweb/REST kinda person) so I have miles to go in the taxonomy department, but I am looking forward to it.

Alroy and others have done a fantastic job building and shepherding Paleodb, and its value is evident from the tremendous amount of research it has generated. I am glad to be supporting that work, while also think about how to add more value, offer more ways to access its information.

Hi Puneet,
So are you at Macquarie University with Alroy's PaleoDB group?  If so, you
might look up Josh Madin (http://acropora.bio.mq.edu.au/people/joshua-madin/)
who's on the faculty there at Macquarie, as he did a lot of work on
semantically annotating ecological data with our projects -- he used to be
at NCEAS -- and this involved building ontologies that reference biological
taxa.  Its still an interest of ours on the Semtools (
http://semtools.ecoinformatics.org) and SONet (
http://sonet.ecoinformatics.org) projects.  Josh wrote some good overview
papers on our work that might be relevant to you:

Madin, J., S. Bowers, M. Schildhauer, S. Krivov, D. Pennington, and F.
Villa. 2007. An ontology for describing and synthesizing ecological
observation data. Ecological Informatics 2:279-296. doi:
10.1016/j.ecoinf.2007.05.004.

Madin, J. S., S. Bowers, M. P. Schildhauer, and M. B. Jones. 2008.
Advancing ecological research with ontologies. Trends in ecology &
evolution 23:159-68. doi: 10.1016/j.tree.2007.11.007.
We're also looking for a semantics postdoc or maybe a semantics engineer
right now for SONet if you know anyone that might be right for this kind of

Hi All

Hackathon discussion is mostly taking place on the open-science-dev list,
which is more aimed at software development and technical stuff than the
general open-science list.

Sign up here if you're interested!

Hi All

I cam across this story on Nature news (
http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/12/could_crowd_sourcing_provide_t.html<http://blogs.nature.com/news/2011/12/could_crowd_sourcing_provide_t.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+news%2Frss%2Fnewsblog+%28News+Blog+-+Blog+Posts%29&utm_content=Google+Reader>
).
In an interesting combination of crowd sourcing and open data release,
openSNP encourages users of personal genome services (23andMe, deCode me
etc) to openly publish their results alongside phenotypic data that they
provide to the site. All data is available under a CC0 license, so is
completely compatible with the Open Knowledge Definition and the Panton
Principles. Is there anyone on the list who has been genotyped and would
like to comment on what they think of the idea?

Hi Jenny,

Personal Genome Project (http://www.personalgenomes.org/ ) is much
older (PGP is five years old, see
http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v1/n1/full/msb4100040.html ). There
are few other similar projects developed later, for example Genomes
Unzipped. Both PGP and GU use CC0 for data and PGP has phenotypic data
available as well.

Given the licensing, having more of such services like OpenSNP, PGP,
GU or whatever else is actually a good idea. You could present the
idea and gather data from culturally different societes (apparently
none of expert judges had any knowledge in the field - neither PGP or
GU is targeted at people outside of personalized medicine/genomics).

Cheers
PS

Hi,
I'm one of the founders of openSNP and up to now i've been a more or less quiet reader of this list. But I think I can give some more information about our project. It is great to see that it gets discussed here. 

I've read Misha Angrist's ?Here is a human being?, so I know about the PGP and I'm also an avid reader of GU. And in a way both were a huge motivation for our work on openSNP. The PGP is a huge and wonderful project and there is no problem with their licensing schemes. But the "problem" is that they don't offer a way to participate for everyone (and up to now they have no way to filter and easily download the data, a thing that is needed to make the data usable). 

Similarly GU does not offer a way to participate for everyone, while those don't offer phenotypic information which is needed for association studies. So basically openSNP was born out of the idea that I also wanted to be able to share my genetic/phenotypic information in order to be able to make it usable for other scientists. 

We think that open science should not only mean that the data itself is shared under open licenses. But that it should also be possible for everybody to actively participate in the science. So I think this is a difference between the PGP, GU and openSNP. Besides this: We are in contact with John Wilbanks of weconsent and GU, because we also think that it would be a good thing to use synergetic effects.

Cheers,
Bastian

I have created a short movie (see

for the hackathon, and may make another before Tuesday. I'd love to see
some movies come out of the event. Mahendra is bringing a camera. I shall
bring my production team.

It will be fun

Peter,

I've quickly transcoded the WMV horror into some better-supported
formats. Feel free to link to them from your blog:

http://dl.dropbox.com/u/171123/swat4ls2.mp4
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/171123/swat4ls2.ogv

The first is H.264 with AAC audio (nonfree but widely supported, and
works on iDevices). The latter is Ogg Theora with Vorbis audio (free
but no matter what I do Theora video sucks).

Transcoded using ffmpeg as detailed here: https://gist.github.com/1430240

Best,
Nick

P.S. On a side note, if anyone knows how to make Theora not suck (i.e.
are there options I'm missing in ffmpeg?) I'd be interested to hear
from them.

Subject: [open-science] Please consider voting for our project in the
	Australian Innovation Challenge
Message-ID: <CADOXZMyv5GzdrnV3To=5EeZ4dW2xsApgEJ-j5fvtDziyYEbRbA@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I really don't want to spam this list, but I wonder if I could ask people
to consider voting for a team I'm leading in the Australian Innovation
Challenge. I've collected a really wonderful group of about 15 people
together from across science and beyond, based in Sydney but including
others, who are interested in whether we can apply lessons recently learned
in open science to open source drug discovery in traditionally
profit-making areas such as diabetes, obesity and cancer. If we won the
prize (of a few thousand dollars) we'd convene a meeting early next year,
which would be broadcast on the web, to discuss the feasibility of such
projects, and the identities of the molecules that would be the early focus
- most likely ex-pharma compounds which have been abandoned through side
effects.

Happy to discuss the idea more, of course. It's a step beyond the open
source drug discovery for malaria project we're currently doing, and allows
us to address head-on whether and how pharma can be involved with open
projects. We'd start small and try to build something from the ground up.

In the meantime, if you wish, you can vote for us in the Health category
here:

http://www.theaustralian.com.au/innovationchallenge

The voting closes in the next *48 hours*, though...

(you may be asked for an Aussie postcode, for some reason. Sydney Uni, for
example, is 2006)

Some back story is here, FYI:

Hi Mat

Thanks for letting us know about the entry - I just voted :)
I'd say it is certainly relevant to interests on the list and a great
discussion to be having! Will you be continuing forward with the team even
if you don't get the funding?

Also, would you be willing to write a blog post for science.okfn.org on
what you're planning? No rush, but if you do get an opportunity we'd love
to advertise the initiative.

Jenny

They also give the accumulated votes so far (which I don't think is a good
idea). Mat seems to be second, so needs some support

BTW I have supported Mat in other Open endeavours - he has great vision and
there is little enough happening in this area.

Hi, 
a small addendum as it seems generally accepted to announce contests that deal with open science. The german wikimedia foundation currently runs their ?WissensWert?-contest (http://wikimedia.de/wiki/WissensWert page is in german). They fund projects that support open knowledge in general with up to 5000 ? plus a public vote that could bring in additional 2000 ? for the winner.  

We, the openSNP-team, also applied for funding. With 7000 ? in total we could afford the genotyping of at least 35 people, which would be a huge boost in available, openly licensed data. If you like the idea you could vote for it here, it is the number two: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?hl=de&formkey=dEFkNHRNWmlGbGpJeURoZVJmVjBabmc6MQ#gid=0

I don't know how many of you have seen this already, but it's a pretty
interesting open source ecology project.

===from ECOLOG===

An interesting article in Science last month about the Nutrient Network (
NutNet) and a new way of conducting ecological research. It reminds me of
the GLORIA (Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine environments)
project, another volunteer international collaboration.

Of course, this is sadly behind a paywall. Let me know if you need a copy.

Thanx for getting this out!

I've took the opportunity to set 'Open Data' as theme for the
Stockholm Open Science next week :) and send everyone the link to the
paper.

Subject: [okfn-discuss] "Open Access" publications under CC-NC licences
To: okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org


There has been considerable recent discussion about CC-NC licences being
used for "Open Access" papers by scholarly publishers. I have written a few
blog posts (

http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/11/29/scientists-should-never-use-cc-nc-this-explains-why/

http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/12/04/more-on-how-commercial-publishers-use-non-commercial-licensing-funders-are-you-really-getting-your-money%E2%80%99s-worth-many-are-not/
,
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/12/06/acceptance-of-cc-nc-has-sold-readers-and-authors-seriously-short/
) and responded to comments. I have summarised this in
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/12/07/%E2%80%9Copen-access%E2%80%9D-and-non-commercial-licences-summary/

Ross Mounce has summarised this as:
*this mess has caused irreparable damage to the re-usability of the
literature
with which I completely agree. I think it's so serious that it should not
be discussed on my blog but brought here.

It took me by surprise that authorPays "Open Access" seems to be almost
completely CC-NC. (The main open Access publishers such as PLoSONE and BMC
have complete OKD-compliance by using CC-BY). CC-NC places so many
restrictions on re-use that it is almost useless in science.

I believe that the OKFN should take this issue very seriously and with
great urgency. We know that multi-author organizations which start using
CC-NC find it impossible to chnage later without approaching every author
and with scholpub this is out of the question, so the longer this goes on
the worse the problem.

I believe that OKFN should put together a group which draws together
resource material which makes the case against NC and then promotoes this
case to publishers and funders. Any aproaches to funders or publishers
could be done through IsItOpenData.

Jenny, Peter, others,

Thank you for sharing.  I've enjoyed and appreciated the links but admit
that understanding the details can be confusing.

So let me see if I got this right:

Fiction: "Non-commerical license sounds great! It means no one can make a
free lunch from my sweat."

Fact: NC means the journal (by holding the copyright) retains the right to *
sell* your work to pharmaceuticals, teachers, researchers interested in
text-mining,  (rather than those groups having *free* use).
-Carl

Hi All

PMR suggested generating a resource pack for publishers and funders on the
use of the NC clause. We can couple this with Is It Open Data? requests
which will converge nicely with the need for clarification of publisher
positions with regard to text and data mining in response to the Hargreaves
Report.

I've set up an Etherpad and started populating it with a great set of
policy statements found by Ross Mounce alongside publications referenced in
the discussions on PMR's blog and associated posts. Please add anything you
feel is relevant!
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-nc-licensing

Additionally, I'll be around on Skype (jcmcoppice12) on Sunday afternoon if
anybody would like to join in making IIOD? requests. Let me know if you
would potentially be available and we can arrange times to suit.

Jenny

Yes - and NC shows that I (the licensee or delegated peson) has their heart
in the right place.

Depends who the copyright holder is. I suspect that some journals retain
copyright (we'll need to crowd source this study). If so you're basically
right. Others allow the author to keep copyright in which case your
statement would be something like:

Fact2: NC means the author (by holding the copyright) retains the right to *
sell* their work to pharmaceuticals, teachers, researchers interested in
text-mining,  (rather than those groups having *free* use). If these groups
wat to re-use the work they have to get specific written permission from
the author. Formally the journal is not involved. However it is likely that
this situation is not made clear on the pages of the journal and there may
be an impression that everything is normal copyright.

Open Science is a combination of data and methods. Or, the full ODOSOS
standard. NCOA violates basic freedoms outlined in Open Standards and
Open Source, and does therefore violate Open Science.

If you make a pack like this, I suggest to include references to the
Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) which clearly disallow NC
clauses. That means that any material with a NC clause cannot be
redistributed at all on many platforms, and the DFSG can serve as a
best practices people have adopted for many years now. I just wrote
this up in my blog too [0].

Egon

Many thanks Egon.  We owe a great debt to the Open Source movement. Without
their clarity of thought we would have little clear guidance.

There is momentum building round this issue. We need to decide which list
to use (the issue is wider than science as it affects all scholpub but in
practice I suspect that almost all APC funding is in science). Probably for
a day it's worth crossposting to open-science open-discuss - then converge.
We should have an Etherpad and either wiki or public Googledocs. I would
prefer Wiki I think but only marginally.

Here are the fields that come to mind immediately:

PUBLISHER
Name of publisher
Fields covered (science, A+H, economics, everything, etc.)
URL for publisher
Person/office to contact (this can be hard and may require phone calls)
Licence for APC publication (null = no APC)
charge (range) for APC
URL Information about OA author rights/procedure
URL pointing to licence statement
URL announcing rights for READERS
Branding of APC OA (e.g. "Open Choice")
NIH compatibility?
Wellcome compatibility?

Some publishers will generate complex discussion - Ross Mounce has already
found an example of Open Access behind a paywall. We should probably have a
separate page / doc for each pubklisher.
(As I write this I think that a Wiki looks increasingly the right tool)

FUNDER
Name of funder
Fields covered (science, A+H, economics, everything, etc.)
URL for funder
Person/office to contact (this can be hard and may require phone calls)
Licence for APC publication
URL Rubric about OA
[more - I haven't thought this through]

Prof. Mike Carroll (a Creative Commons board member who oversees the Science Commons division) has also taken this position. He just published a paper in PLoS Biology, Why Full Open Access Matters, at http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001210.  Might be useful to include/cite in the resource pack.

Lots of valuable input. We need someone to coordinate this (not me although
I am happy to be on a working group). It shouldn't take more than a few
days to (a) survey current practice in major publishers and funders and (b)
collect the supporting literature.

I am prepared to put in an FOI request to OUP and CUP as they are required
to answer and I'll ask them things like
* when
* why
* who

More later

Could somebody suggest lists of major publishers and funders we could use
to quickly populate a wiki table?
It's probably easier to crowd source this if we have a finite list as a
starting point.

Here's a good starting point for publishers:
 http://www.pspcentral.org/rtMemberCo/memberCo_001.cfm

This is a member organization so won't have the smaller ones (assuming fees
are significant) and may be biased towards US.

Funders are much harder because they are likely to be country based. But I
think a quick first pass over these would be a great way forward.

Hi All

Exciting news! OKF has been successsful in obtaining OSI funding for two
fellowships in the field of open data in science.
More details to follow but needless to say this is a great achievement and
thanks must go to to Jonathan Gray and Peter Murray-Rust for making it
happen.

You can see some of the background on Jonathan's site

I was sad to see a blogpost by Heather Morrison - an "open access advocate"
argue strongly for CC-NC-BY-SA rather than CC-BY for "Open Access"
articles.
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.com/2011/12/dissension-in-open-access-ranks-on-cc.html
Heather asks for comment, but there is no online mechanism so I am replying
to her here. I'll just say that many of the assertions and arguments about
the value of CC-NC are flawed.

It would be extremely damaging if the non-openAccess community were to take
away the view that there are different strengths of OA and that anyone can
choose what they like. There is OA-gratis and OA-libre. Organisations like
SPARC have asserted that CC-BY is the effective licence for libre OA and
that CC-NC is not compliant.  CC-NC is not libre OA and cannot be redefined
to be so. (I don't have references - that's what this post is about).

Rather than rehearse the arguments against CC-NC in this post it is
critical that we assemble *rapidly* a compelling simple resource pack. If -
as Heather suggests - we have OA advocates arguing that the third world
should use CC-NC to protect the value of their contributions it will even
further damage the re-use of information.

It's possible that SPARC or other organizations have some documents, but we
are going to have to do this as a matter of urgency.

All,

Following on from a comment to some attendees of #DevCSI in the pub after the event, I've started this thread on Google+ 

Please feel free to have a look and/or leave a comment. Daniel Meitchen has already posted two.

I'm not a member of Google+, but this might be an inspiration for the
discussion:

The Semantic Web Journal implemented an open and transparent review
process. Here you find more facts and the link to a longer paper about it:

http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/blog/semantic-web-journal-after-18-months-some-facts

Here is a video of a presentation of Pascal about the Journal and its
innovative peer-review process:

The relevant tidbits about the journal's review process (taken from
http://knoesis.wright.edu/faculty/pascal/resources/publications/LP2012.pdf
):
"In contrast to the vast majority of computer science journals, the
Semantic Web journal
combines a pre-press open access with an open and transparent review
process. All submitted
manuscripts are published online and are accessible to the public
without registration. The
responsible editors and solicited reviewers are given by name and are
published in the header of
accepted papers. Additionally, registered and pre-approved users can
add open, not-solicited
reviews via the journal's Web page. Authors can submit their
responding letters to the reviewers
in public to document the changes made when revising their manuscript
if they like to. The
journal follows an opt-out approach which allows reviewers to stay
anonymous on request. To
implement a  digital forgetting [5] the reviews and manuscripts of
rejected submissions are
available online only for a limited time. While the Semantic Web
journal makes pre-press
manuscripts available online, it is not a classical open-access
journal. The final, typeset versions
are only available on subscription via IOS Press as printed issues or
PDF files."

In summary, it's similar to the European Geoscience Union's two-stage
publication process, just that the second stage is not Open Access and
that manuscripts rejected in the first stage are being "forgotten"
after a while.

I've made a few more significant discoveries WRT 'fake' / mislabelled
"open access" publications and policies.

The etherpad is great place to coordinate but I feel a spreadsheet
might be better for the actual data & evidence compilation thus I'm
tabulating my finds here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdDFzdkVNQld6Mnc5NEpGWVlRUVhvM3c

Further to examples I originally found - alarmingly it appears Nature
(NPG) is publishing "open access" articles under CC-BY-NC-ND or
CC-BY-NC-SA licenses	e.g.
http://www.nature.com/ncomms/open_access/index.html

also from a medical perspective, it's rather worrying that BMJ is
using CC-BY-NC 2.0	http://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-authors/forms-policies-and-checklists/copyright-open-access-and-permission-reuse

these are far from exceptional examples. The majority of those with
some form of "open access" I've looked at so far don't seem to have
quite understood the Budapest Declaration.

The site searching process is slow though, and I won't be able to do
much more on it this week due to other pressing commitments (sorry!),
thus we really could do with some help here...

I'll start populating my spreadsheet with publisher names and URL's -
if others could perhaps crowdsource analyses of these publishers' open
access policies that'd be a BIG help.

Best,

Ross

Ross this is brilliant! You have made such a good platform that there is
really no excuse for readers of this list not to contribute

- we should differentiate Open Access journals from Hybrid Open Access. For
example Springer Open Choice is hybrid. Springer Open describes their
collection of Open Access journals. You (Ross) have used green for this?
But if you want a colour it should be Gold (yellow) for Springer Open and
blank for hybrid.
- it's worth putting in prices. Nature charges $5000 for hybrid
- pity to see indivdiual non-commercial licences as they are almost
certainly legally flawed and/or contradictory
- suggest you put in name of rapporteur
- critical to make sure that as far as possible all the info for a given
publisher is collected simultaneously as web pages change.

Reading your list I don't see *any* OA-libre offerings in the hybrid
schemes. paradoxically it can cost MORE to publish in some hybrid schemes
(where the publisher also collects subscription revenue so double dips)
than for full Open Access - libre.

I don't think these hint at the publishers "not understanding" the
Budapest Declaration but at their desire to deviate as little as
possible from their traditional models while disguising as "open".

For BMJ, the main motivation for going NC seems to have been to avoid
big pharma republishing articles (perhaps even slightly edited).

One way to find NC-licensed papers/ publishers is via searches like
http://www.google.de/search?gcx=c&ix=c1&q=site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc+%22http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc%22+-%22nc-sa%22+-%22nc-nd%22
or - with a publisher's DOI prefix added -
http://www.google.de/search?gcx=c&ix=c1&q=site%3Awww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpmc+%22http%3A%2F%2Fcreativecommons.org%2Flicenses%2Fby-nc%22+-%22nc-sa%22+-%22nc-nd%22+10.1038
(see also http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/12/06/acceptance-of-cc-nc-has-sold-readers-and-authors-seriously-short/#comment-101279
).

There are a few articles with contradicting licenses:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3064401/ states
" freely available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution
Non-Commercial Licence
(http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.5/) "
on the top and

Another way to check for NC-licensed journals is
http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=licensedJournals .

Publisher policies can be found via RoMEO, whose entries usually
contain (sometimes outdated) links to the publisher's default
copyright policies and to the OA options. Example for Elsevier:
http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/search.php?id=30&format=full .

Entries 103/4/5 are described as "no open access journals". There is still
the possibility (??) that they might allow hybrid publication.

I am planning to send in FoI requests to CUP and OUP on this questions as
they are required to answer. I'll float the Qs on the Etherpad.
Contributions welcome

Ross has done a great job on surveying publishers - about 30 rows out of
115 and some of these are nor relevant. I have renamed the spreadsheet and
some fields to "gratisOA" because it is more informative than "fakeOA".

The situation is far worse than I thought. Author-paid and funder-paid
hybrid Open Access is almost universally not OA-libre (only one of 30 was
libre-OA (Amer Phys Soc). Fees range from 1000 USD to 5000 USD (though this
is based on very few). the Commonest licence is CC-NC (or variants). A few
publishers don't mention licences and try to express this in web-page
prose.

We are at a critical point. If this continues, even for a few months, we'll
universally have paid "OpenAccess" that does not meet the Open Definition.
Most pubishers are not "Open Access" publishers in that they don't have
Open Access (gold) journals so they will come to see the acceptable level
of paid "Open Access"  as CC-NC. (A licence that is neither Open nor
operable and may be retired by CC). The result will be a sludge of
non-interoperable articles and either a series of individual squabbles of
funders with publishers or a resignation that non-libre-OA is all that the
Open Access movement can achieve. It will then spend billions of dollars on
a product of little value.

At least the OKF, if no-one else, understands. Our immediate goal is to
summarise the position objectively. Then we can present this to funders and
government.

We urgently need more volunteers. That means you. I'd guess that the total
amount of time is < 1 hour per publisher. (It clearly is for Ross as he has
done 30 in less than 30 hours elapsed). That's perhaps 50 hours across the
whole of OKF readers. You don't have to be a scientist to do it - just be
prepared to look at endless websites.

Subject: [open-science] SPARC author addendum uses CC-NC licence and now all

Message-ID: <CAD2k14MCPt_CCVCjdQ9w6=CUawLu+swjwzxqpStzXWGSdUfLDQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have discovered to my surprise and disappointment that the SPARC/SC
author addendum for scholarly publishing requests the publisher to allow
the author to distribute their work under a CC-NC or equivalent licence.
The addendum was created as a joint activity between Science Commons and
SPARC (copied).
http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/addendum.shtml
and
http://www.arl.org/sparc/bm~doc/Access-Reuse_Addendum.pdf

4. Author?s Retention of Rights. Notwithstanding any terms in the
Publication Agreement to the contrary, AUTHOR and
PUBLISHER agree that in addition to any rights under copyright retained by
Author in the Publication Agreement, Author
retains: (i) the rights to reproduce, to distribute, to publicly perform,
and to publicly display the Article in any medium for noncommercial
purposes; (ii) the right to prepare derivative works from the Article; and
(iii) the right to authorize others to make
any *non-commercial use* of the Article so long as Author receives credit
as author and the journal in which the Article has been
published is cited as the source of first publication of the Article. For
example, Author may make and distribute copies in the
course of teaching and research and may post the Article on personal or
institutional Web sites and in other open-access digital
repositories.

This was crafted in 2006 and since then there is abundant evidence and
argument that CC-NC is extremely limiting (e.g. no permission to use
diagrans in textbooks and also unworkable). We have heard on this list that
CC are considering an option to retire CC-NC.

The addendum was primarily crafted for cases where the author did not pay
for publication. Yet almost all publishers now licence PAID "open Access"
as CC-NC.

Michael Carroll (copied) was one of the authors of the SPARC addendum but
now argues strongly for "full open Access" - i.e. libre-OA, OKD compliant:
http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001210
Yet CC-NC is becoming more common, not less, in paid "Open Access". I do
not know why this is happening but the publishers are using CC-NC even with
fees of up to 5000 USD per article. The more that this is allowed to happen
unchallenged, the more we destroy any hope of real Open access, even when
paid by funders.

Some authoritative anecdotal evidence that Springer's use of CC-NC could be
"an administrative oversight". We have a contact and should use
IsItOpenData to follow this up and get a definitive answer and also try to
change policy.

Thanks Heather,
Have you seen the almost universal CC-NC  that Ross Mounce has accumulated
for hybridOA? We have to change this now or we will spend a decade trying
to recover the ground

Some further thoughts on CC licenses and open access:

Scholars need and want to disseminate their work, and for others to  
build on it. Open access is awesome for that. However, scholars are  
also human beings who need food and shelter. Peter Murray-Rust, may I  
assume  that you have a secure, tenured position and financial  
security for your retirement? If so, this is great, but you should be  
aware that this not true for an increasing percentage of scholars  
today. In the U.S., for example, my understanding is that 75% of  
courses are now taught by sessionals.

 From the American Association of University Professors FAQ, here are  
some of measures being taken to address the financial crisis in  
academia: "hiring and salary freezes, furloughs, salary cuts, layoffs,  
nonrenewals, reduction and elimination of academic programs and  
colleges, revision of curricula, changes in academic policy,  
elimination of tenure, substantial changes in workload"...
http://www.aaup.org/aaup/financial/mainpage.htm

As a personal story, lack of financial security is one of the reasons  
why I use CC-NC. The vast majority of my own work is not funded at  
all. This is increasingly common in the social sciences and  
humanities. There could be a point in time where I might have good  
reason to want to try to sell some of my work, to pay my rent and  
grocery bills. Not that I personally am that important, but the  
measures mentioned above indicate that I have plenty of company. Like  
most scholars and publishers, I am the 99%.

If I gave away my work and saw that someone else had sold it and kept  
the profits for themselves, I would be MAD. Not only at them - but  
also at anyone who told me that I should give away my work. If I was  
among those who were recently laid off, and I saw someone else  
profiting off my work, I would be REALLY REALLY MAD. Wouldn't you?

Publishers also need resources in order to produce work, whether this  
is paid, volunteer, or in-kind. There are some areas where funding is  
generous and full support for OA via article processing fees may well  
be feasible. However, in many scholarly areas funding is much less  
generous, and publishers may NEED to reserve commercial rights. Even  
with the well-funded areas, if publishers develop hybrid revenue  
streams by reserving commercial rights, that might well make it  
possible to offer more affordable article processing fees to academia.

Regarding CC abandoning NC: I am trying to recommend to CC (if I can  
get registered to speak) that they adjust the licenses rather than  
abandoning NC. For example, if there is concern that people are  
interpreting NC as not including educational rights, then add a  
statement to the NC license along the lines of "Education is not  
commercial". Not only would this improve the NC license, in the long  
term I believe that this will add to support for good overall  
copyright licensing on an international level, as education should be  
understood as noncommercial, period. If CC abandons NC, I would have  
to abandon CC. (I would like to note that I am a strong supporter of  
CC today - I speak out for CC, use the licenses, encourage others to  
do so, and contribute to the annual donation campaign).

While we are on the topic of CC licensing, some comments about the  
other elements:

SA: this is necessary to ensure that authors, their publishers and  
institutions, who give away their works have access to derivatives  
built on them. This is not just a third-world problem. I hear that  
there have been severe funding cuts to higher education even in the UK.

Noderivatives: there are valid scholarly reasons why noderivatives may  
sometimes be a superior license. One example is the area at the  
boundary of pharmacology and toxicology. Here, relying on an imperfect  
translation could kill people. Another is that in some scholarly  
areas, such as literature and art, creative expression is the very  
heart of the scholarship. It strikes me that many scholars would be  
more likely to share their work if they felt comfortable that they had  
the right to insist on no derivatives.

I hope this message gets through to the list - my last two messages to  
the open science list don't seem to have gone through.

Heather,
I think you need to clarify exactly what you are and are not covering. If
you wish, as an academic, to generate income by receiving payment for
academic authorship that is acceptable in some disciplines but is not
expected in others. There is also a strong distinction between journal
articles (where almost all OA discussion applies) and monographs/chapters
which are largely excluded from OA. A large argument for Open Access is
that authors receive no payment for their work. This is universal in
scientific journals.

Your article covers science in some detail and I have replied assuming that
your recommendation was universal and applied equally to science

Data mining is a fine thing to advance science. Allowing commercial
applications means that authors and publishers that have given away their
own work as OA, may not be able to afford the value-added version created
through data mining. If data mining is the leap ahead that I think this is,
this means that the less affluent scholars, libraries and publishers end up
relatively further behind. That is, one step ahead in gaining the
advantages of OA per se, and two steps behind if they cannot afford the
value-add built on their work. For this reason, I strongly recommend that
OA publishers in the third world use CC-NC licenses.

Text-and data mining in science - AND creation of derivative works -  is
only possible with CC-BY articles. Most articles are not OA and ban mining.
If one mines a single CC-NC-SA article then it requires the complete set of
results - even from CC-BY - to become CC-NC-SA. In many cases it is legally
impossible to mix products of different licences.

.

This argument is similar to - and largely derived from - the copyleft
approach of the GPL software licence. The philosophy behind that is that it
generates a large industry from likeminded software authors. In some
subdisciplines, this has some traction but it effectively cuts out all
commercial use and exploitation. Open source industry uses licences which
map roughly onto CC-BY such as Apache 2.0. Companies who wish to add value
simply avoid GPL and this will be the same in CC-NC (assuming they honour
the licence).

> Not at all! I write masses of Open source under BSD-like  licences and
make it available for anyone to use ("give it away"). As a result many
people have re-used it. Some of these are commercial organizations who
incoprate it in their system and sell it. They are meant to credit me and
co-authors - since I do not know who they are I have no way of checking.
They do not make their system available to me - this is consistent with the
philosophy of Open Source. Some are commercial organizations who do make it
availableand I can use their additions.

In Open Source community (and many of those don't have permanent jobs) it's
standard to use BSD-like licences. There is only one group using GPL
(SA-like) and that's because they have inherited it. They hate it and are
actively working to rewrite the whole system.

It's not going to be easy, but CC-NC-SA has no part in solving it.

Please make sure that your read the various critiques of NC very carefully.
"Commercial" includes any act of exchanging goods - like allowing adverts
on the site. Submitting a paper to a journal is an exchange of goods - a
commercial act. The evaluation of what is commercial will be made by a
court by reading the licence and applying the laws of the appropriate
domains. If Mike Carroll who wrote the SPARC author addendum is strongly
arguing against NC then think very carefully.

Almost all education is commercial. Student pay fees - that is a commercial
transaction. Do not confuse "commercial" with "non-profit" or attempt to
read the motivation of the author. The last two are irrelevant in most
jurisdictions.

A licence is a legal document. The software industry (which is ahead of
publishing) learnt that it is extremely dangerous to try to tweak licences.
huge amounts of effort have gone into licence creation.

My analysis is that SA will primarily act to reduce the size of the
downstream activity, not to return wealth-producing goods and services to
the author.  Derivatives do not return wealth. As for non-SA derivatives
the licence allows anyone to exploit the derivatives - there is no monopoly
for the original author.

I have sympathy with this, having tried to use licences myself to control
such derivatives and moved away from this approach. Licences are too
imprecise to control downstream use. In the case you mention, certification
is an appropriate mechanism.  A community creates norms of practice and
requires practioners to use particular artifacts.

I understand your position - it may be that for certain disciplines
something can be made to work. The University of Iowa made theses Open
CC-BY and the students in Creative Writing protested as they c/would lose
income. The University reversed its policy - for all disciplines - so that
the science theses are no longer Open.

Thank you Heather!

Well made points, really glad you have brought up such an important issue.

 I aired similar worries in previous related posts.

There could be commercial motives behind manipulating the open data
movement while actually pushing for royalty free data and content, to
 benefit *only* those who have the marketing networks in place, ie, major
shareholders of the intellectual property industry, who have the economic
power to generate wealth from creative works, and, as it happens, also
control over multinational information networks.

I stand by author's rights as human rights, and fully second your stance.

In the case of government data,  commercial exploitation rights should be
paid to cover for the costs of generating and curating their publication,
essentially meaning that the open data will not be a burden on taxpayers,
but a sustainable economic system.

Hope there will be opportunities to make a stronger and wider case
about this in the future

best

I am interested in understanding more of some of the things you say below

I am glad you think so. When I had the chance, I advised a developing
country who started a CC system exactly that.
As Heather says, the economic situation for most creatives, intellectuals
and independent thinkers, is very similar to that of a developing economy.
Most Creatives (and independent thinkers who produce original works) live
in economic uncertainty, if not in poverty.

Among the work to be done is probably developing suitable language and
concepts, by commercial exploitation for the purpose of author's rights it
is intended 'that generates any kind of income or economic wealth', which
in a fair system should be equally distributed amongst all
creators and distributors, and not solely benefit those who
own and control the means of production



Almost all education is commercial.

possibly, but in the case they do, the license should protect all
rights holders

Please explain more. There is a whole industry that exploits derivative
work, afaik.

As I tried to explain, only those who own and control markets
have the capability and interest to exploit any intellectual property work,
including derivatives


Lots more to be understood and discussed

I don't think that's quite a fair representation. There are people who
prefer GPL licensing, and apply it to new code. However, I think it's true
that in 20 years, not many people have successfully made a living from
selling commercial use rights to GPL licensed code (Riverbank is the only
example that comes to mind). The trend does now seem to be towards
permissive (BSD-like) licenses.

I think the prospects for science are largely the same. Data miners will
mostly simply steer clear of NC or SA licensed data, in favour of data they
can use freely. If the majority of datasets are NC or SA licensed, most
likely it will just mean that little data mining happens at all.

NC is superficially attractive, because it appears to allow reuse of your
work for things that give us a warm fuzzy feeling - charities, academic
research, and so on - but leave you free to make demands of money-grubbing
corporations. But that's a very tricky distinction to make in an objective,
legally sound way, and it turns out that NC restricts a lot more use than
most people using it probably intend.

My position (and why I also use BSD-style licenses for code) is that if I'm
happy for people to use my work, then I'm happy for them to use it in
support of trying to make money. Economic activity is not inherently evil.
Imagine if the author of every open source library and tool demanded
payment from every company running their code for profit. Big companies
would duplicate the effort to write their own equivalents, and many
startups would never happen at all.

More reasons for noncommercial:

AD REVENUE

Ad revenue is a great example of why many authors and publishers would  
not want to give away commercial rights, for very good reasons.

For a publisher, ad revenue can be one way of supporting a journal  
economically. It makes perfect sense for a journal to reserve rights  
to ad revenue derived from their journal.

Social media tools do provide interesting challenges. Google blogger  
is a good role model in this sense. Even without CC licensing, I can  
choose to turn on adsense, in which case they share the revenue with  
me; or, as in my case, if I do not wish to have ads appear on my blog,  
I can leave this turned off.

RESALE OF WHOLE JOURNALS AND JOURNAL PACKAGES

If Springer Open becomes a wild success and eventually Springer goes  
full CC-BY for all of their journals, then anyone can take Springer  
journals and re-sell them. Imagine if Elsevier were to take these  
journals and sell them, but not sharealike, then Elsevier could sell a  
version of Science Direct that includes all of the Springer journals,  
but Springer could not provide access to Elsevier journals. This could  
cost Springer prestige, impact, ad revenue, and opportunities to earn  
money themselves through value-added products. Or, imagine that your  
articles or your journal (or value-added products based on them) were  
offered for sale by the likes of the publishers listed on Beall's list  
of predatory open access publishers:
http://metadata.posterous.com/83235355

Thanks for raising this important discussion.

best,

Heather Morrison

But what would be the point? If access to those (Springer) journals is free
anyway, it does Elsevier no good to 'sell' access to them. If anything, it
increases the impact of those journals by reminding researchers to look at
them.

In terms of ad revenue, "it's open access, but you have to access it here"
doesn't seem really open at all. What if, for example, you have a tool to
scan new papers for keywords, find interesting ones, and automatically
download the PDF to your library? You're not going to see any of the
publisher's ads*. I know publishers need some source of income, but I don't
think they can or should be relying on ad revenue.

* Please, please, nobody suggest that publishers embed ads in PDFs of
academic papers. I feel dirty for even thinking of such an abomination.

It's also worth noting that BiomedCentral have published completely Open
journals for a decade under a CC-BY licence and that PLoS are also
completely CC-BY. I know of no significant reselling of content.

There is, perhaps, a danger that major metadata sellers might resell access
to the complete literature. That's why we are also campaigning for Open
Buibliography so we don't get locked into/out_of a walled garden.

Two new points:

Harvard OA policy specifies "but not for a profit". This kind of suggests that Harvard faculty have not agreed to give away their work for commercial purposes, doesn't it?

SPARC author's rights addendum: this is only needed for toll access publishers; there would never be any reason to use this with a publisher that is okay with CC-BY. So if SPARC made this NC, that makes perfect sense. If it were changed to allow for commercial use, why would the publishers with whom this is necessary agree to this? I think this could largely defeat the purpose of having an addendum.

CC, NC, and scholarly blogs - an emerging format that we need to think about, and would be impacted if CC were to drop NC. Someone please correct me if I am wrong: I assume that if my blog license were changed to CC-BY, then someone else could set up a mirror site, turn on Adsense, and keep the revenue for themselves. To me, this would be offensive, take away a source of potential revenue I might actually need someday, and quite possibly decrease my own blog stats - a measure that some of us might wish to use to show the value of this more open approach. For all these reasons, if CC-NC disappears, then CC will disappear from my blog, and I will happily go back to automatic copyright or a more restrictive license, as these would be my best options.

Great, and long overdue discussion!

Best,

Very interesting thread.  Sounds like open peer review can mean a lot of
different things - perhaps better terminology is needed?  A few other
examples for the list:

Biology Direct has always practiced open peer review in which reviews are
solicited; then having received the reviews (either positive or negative)
the author can opt to have the paper published, can make changes & publish,
or can withdraw the paper. Any time the paper is published the reviews are
published with it, with the reviewers name, and with the author's reply to
the reviews. http://www.biology-direct.com/

The Nature journal EMBO has an innovative but less extreme process where
reviews are solicited, identities are included, but the reviews are
published (as a supplement) only if the paper is accepted. The open review
is opt-in, with 95% opting in. Interestingly reviewers are encouraged to
"cross-review" or comment on remarks of other reviewers. They have stats
showing that about 10% of the time people download the peer-review comments
when they download the paper, comparable to downloads of traditional
supplements. http://www.nature.com/emboj/about/process.html

Nature did an experiment with its flagship journal on unsolicited open peer
review in 2006 in parallel with it's traditional peer review. They deemed
it unsuccessful due to low opt-in rates among authors and few & lower
quality reviews in the open.
http://www.nature.com/nature/peerreview/debate/nature05535.html


Victoria Stodden had a good discussion about this on her blog a while back,
but something seems wrong with the site now?

But:
* These hypothetical stealing bloggers still need to say where it's come
from, and if you do a decent job at promoting your own site, it should get
most of the visitors, appear higher in search rankings, and so on. There
are sites out there that just mirror Wikipedia for profit, but none of them
have made much of an impact, as far as I know.
* No other blogger can repost any copyrightable part of your work (like a
diagram you've drawn) if their blog is also ad supported. To my mind, this
sort of reuse is a key part of what open access aims to allow.
* Tools such as RSS aggregators or Readability will already deprive you of
ad revenue, however you license your content. It's impossible to force
people to read things on your site, with your ads beside them.

Personally, if the work is publicly funded then I think CC-BY or public 
domain is appropriate.  The reason is that a major motivator for public 
funding of long-term basic research is that the research can later be used 
by anyone as the basis of commercial products which benefit the broader 
public; the rising tide floats all boats argument for supporting public 
funding of basic research.  If researchers wish not to contribute to a 
broader commons, then I believe they should forfeit the public funding.

On the other hand, if the research is funded in some other way --- by a 
company, or out of the author's own pocket, for example --- then I think 
it's up to the people funding the work to decide under what license it 
should be released.  I certainly have no problem with a CC-BY-NC or more 
restrictive license under those circumstances, for many of the reasons 
Heather describes.

Two comments (capitals are just a formatting thing, I'm not angry!)

COPYRIGHT DOES NOT COVER IDEAS

It sounds to me like you are making a common mistake, assuming that  
copyright applies to ideas. Please correct me if I am wrong about  
this. If a research article is shared as open access under CC-NC, then  
anyone can read it and make use of the ideas contained in it without  
asking for permission. If you are thinking text / data mining, then CC- 
SA would work just fine.

PRIVATE GAIN AS BROADER COMMONS

It sounds to me like you are saying that  commercial products  
"benefits the broader public" and is a "broader commons". Is this what  
you meant to say? If so, I have some further questions for you...

best,

Heather Morrison

I'm well aware copyright law isn't intended to apply to ideas.  The intent 
of my remark was to summarize part of the reason I am broadly in favour of 
the general principle that publicly funded science should be open science. 
The use of non-NC licenses seems to me to follow as a very specific 
instance of this broad general principle.  I hope that clarifies the 
intent of my remarks.

I certainly believe that many commercial products benefit the broader 
public.  On the other hand, I don't believe that most (there are some 
exceptions) commercial products are part of a broader commons, although of 
course they do build on a broad background commons of basic scientific 
research.

Hi All,

I am giving my quick comments/suggestions on the subject... shall we ask
the author to choose his own terms of license as per his/her institution
requirement?

I am sorry I have not gone thru the discussion... I shall be doing the same
now..

as the author addendum is only a format... while educating the authors
about various licenses, if the format allows the author to choose the best
license, it would be better...

what others may say?

Thanks & Regards
Sridhar

Comment: this does clarify your intent - and it is a noble intent -  
with respect to this one issue. I don't agree that the one follows  
from the other, except in a simplistic sense.

Question for you: your comments here are on publicly funded science.  
The discussion on the list has been about scholarly publishing CC  
licensing in general - what I understand as a plan to pressure all OA  
publishers to adopt CC-BY licenses, as well as about eliminating the  
NC option from CC licensing. Can you comment on these two broader  
issues? Do you have an intent here, and if so, what is it?

I don't see how a journal article can be regarded as fully open when it 
can't be reused for commercial purposes.  It's such a huge restriction, as 
others have pointed out.

Just to be clear, and as I said in an earlier comment, I have no problem 
of principle if privately-funded actors (either individuals or companies) 
want to publish in less open or closed forms (including NC).

As regards the two issues you mention above, I haven't thought either 
through in enough detail to have a principled opinion.  As a practical 
matter, insofar as many OA journals mostly publish publicly-funded 
research, I hope those journals will publish without the NC restriction.

Comment: I agree that it is optimal to give the author a chance to  
select the license. For one thing, this element is part of a broader  
transformation in scholarly communication. We want authors to think  
about, and assert, their rights when publishing. Giving them the  
option to choose the license is empowering for the author. Journals  
will likely want to have a default license, as many authors will  
decide to accept this.

If scholarly authors get involved in selecting their own licenses,  
this may help to encourage more scholars to give serious thought to  
this recently invented notion of "intellectual property". Even if in  
the short term we have a plethora of incompatible licenses, this is  
such an important area for society as a whole that we should aim to do  
it right, not quickly.

It would be great, from my perspective, if we heard more from scholars  
in developing countries and our own First Nations peoples to help us  
all figure out the best solutions for a global commons. For example, I  
understand that Latin America has a much stronger history of sharing,  
a copyleft perspective, that we in North America should listen to  
carefully before making too many decisions about intellectual  
property. Greg Young-Ing, in his thesis on traditional knowledge,  
talked about a concept of the knowledge belonging both to the people  
and to the environment that makes a lot of sense to me. For example,  
knowledge about a species cannot just belong to any researcher; it  
belongs to the species, and to the other species with which it shares  
an ecosystem (paraphrasing a lot here). If we want to develop the  
kinds of knowledge that will best serve us to live in harmony with the  
planet, we need to seek out perspectives like these, and ask ourselves  
what is lacking in Western thought. For all our scientific and  
technological development, surely the mess we have made of the world  
should tell all of us that we in the West are not exactly perfect when  
it comes to wisdom about things like knowledge.

best,

Heather

Let's agree to disagree on this. I am aware that there are many who  
think that open access is equivalent to CC-BY. I hope that after this  
discussion, all are aware that there is no consensus on this point  
among open access advocates. To be clear, I do not merely mean to say  
that sometimes we must compromise. From my perspective, CC-BY is a  
weaker form of open access, that superficially appears to map to the  
BOAI definition, but this will not work out in practice because of the  
world that we live and the things that people must do to survive in it.

Here is where I think we differ a little in perspective. Perhaps this  
could be because I come from a less intensively capitalist country? It  
would rarely make sense to me to refer to individuals as privately  
funded. Also, what about the not-for-profit publishers?

If copyright rests with the author, it should be the author's

Dear Carl,

Absolutely, in an article (being published in February, unfortunately in 
German language) I tried to differentiate this phenomenon a little. To 
my mind there are several dimensions of openness in open review:
at what state of matureness a document and its review are made openly 
available? at the the end of a closed and traditional peer review? or 
immediately after submission and after surviving the desk reject (which 
also means that the review will be available immediately)? will the 
peers be anonymous or non-anonymous, are they allowed to opt? who may 
contribute comments or act as a peer (everyone, registered users, 
selected peers)? how interactive will the review be (binary or 
discursive)?

perhaps this might also be of interest in this context: repec started a 
trial with a peer review showroom: http://peerreview.repec.org/

and another thing one might think about (perhaps some does already; I am 
not quite sure about the state of the art at that point): how can we 
make reviews not only openly available but also include them into the 
oai-data? perhaps we could consider articles and reviews compound 
objects according to oai-ore or as distinct scientific publications.

I do not have a secure position, yet I do not feel the NC clause is
useful. There is no cause-effect relation any need and the use of NC.

In fact, I think removal of the NC clause is a opportunity for these
untenured scientists, as it allows them to set up a business around
non-NC content, as it may fit their need.

For example, the NC clause is incompatible with the Debian Free
Software Guidelines, meaning that any NC material is a no-go area for
mixing with Open Source tools I am working on. It means I cannot use
NC material to create better application. So, closed area to such
applications.

And that means, very much reduced changes for me to get enough funding
to get tenured.

I agree Open Access is a bad term, and used for completely different
concepts. I prefer not to use it.

The Open Source community has struggled this for years, yet, the NC
clause is not used there. Companies have been very successful, and
many survive in that environment. In your opinion, what aspects of
publishing papers and software being different mean that a world
without NC works for software but not for publishing?

I believe all current generation scientists are running a one-man
business: they sell there services to the higher bidder (not
necessarily financially; yeah, I am looking at you, University of X!),
while keeping their on interest in mind, besides that of the group
they work in (they are expected to show independence!). So, I rather
see myself as a self-funded scientist, who just gets funding from
different universities.

This situation is not rare, and is the only thing I see around me.

My point is... the NC clause / tenure / finance situation is not a
directed dependencies. It both makes it harder and simpler... neither
really matters, it's the eco system that can be created without the NC
clause that really matters. Open Source has shown this to work, and I
have not seen arguments why this would not work for publications
either...

Indeed.

And to add another example illustrating this:

What "Frontiers" http://www.frontiersin.org/ calls "Open Review"
just means that the identity of the reviewer(s) is disclosed after
acceptance (see, e.g., 
http://www.frontiersin.org/neuroinformatics/reviewguidelines)

Subject: [open-science] Discussion of Open Access and CC licences in science
Message-ID: <CAD2k14PMUwrS9yLDm8zWo6RgYbeJ5NPhcKf6i-b6puq5+fyVtw@mail.gmail.com>

I am pleased to see strong discussion on OKF lists. Several issues have
been raised (some by me). It may be useful to draw some distinctions.

* The context of the discussion is largely scholarly publication. If we
step outside this then I think there will be littel consensus
* There is a distinction between monographs and articles in serials. Open
Access for monographs is much less advanced than for serials.
* Most scholarly publication occurs in science and most of that is funded
directly or indirectly from the public purse (including charities). We can
exclude companies publishing their work.
* The public purse expects "Open" publication. It spends (world wide) about
100,000,000,000 -> 1,000,000,000,000 USD on the research (I have tried to
get better figures). The public purse spends about 10,000,000,000 USD on
publication (author and reader-sides).

The particular issue is that funders require Open Access and many
publishers resist this. Large amounts are spent on funded Open Access (up
to  5000 USD per article). There is no consensus on what funders or authors
get for this sum (a wide variety of licences are used - see Ross' fantastic
spreadsheet). My personal view is that 5000 USD for a NC licence (as
opposed to a free Green copy of the author's manuscript) represents almost
no added values.

If arts and humanities feel that CC-NC meets their needs - where there is
no implicit or explicitly funder - then I probably shan't challenge this.
But if CC-NC is used for science we shall have monumentally reduced the
value of the work that has been funded.

I suggest that we restrict a major part of our discussion to the area I
have outlined above - funded research isn scientific serials. If others
wish to discuss monographs, etc. then let's label them as separate
discussions.

The urgent issue for science is to urge that all funded publication of
scientific articles should be CC-BY. The arguments about creative artists
protecting their work may be valid elsewhere but should not spill over into
science.

Dear All

I've been following this from a distance as, co-incidentally, I have been in South Africa working with people there interested in Scholarly Communications and development for Africa. I've written a post which you can find here:

http://cameronneylon.net/blog/open-access-for-the-other-85/

It only really deals with part of the argument but I hope it makes that case - I also hope it will bring in more of the voices that Heather has been asking for, those from the developing world who can give their own view and expertise.

Briefly on some other issues:

I love it when people copy my content and link back to me. It increases my Page Rank, it brings more eyeballs to my opinions, and it increases my "impact". My view is that these people are doing free advertising for me. Now I don't feed myself with this writing so I am speaking from a position of privilege but I would also argue that I could feed myself by using the profile that those words have got me. Again - these people are doing my advertising for me.

The NC view, which I can understand, is one of "if I can't make money of this then no-one else will". But we're in the process of creating entirely new markets and expanding existing ones. When someone else makes money of your work they potentially bring money and attention back into the commons, growing the opportunities for others to make more money. The economics of networks can be entirely different, and an open network can scale more effectively than a closed one.

Now there are, as Heather - and I think it was - Dario say, risks of enclosure and monopolisation. But these to my view are social and economic risks, not legal ones. And they are better handled using instruments other than legal ones. At the end of the day an NC licence is of no value unless you're prepared to go to the wall to defend it. The people who are going to cheat will still cheat - the ones you'd like to use your content will be scared away. I think we do need much more evidence on the realities of what happens and how the complex mixture of licence and legal instrument and licence and social signal that we seem to have really works in practice. But in the meantime I will stick with the view that we need social and economic instruments to mitigate the risks of monopolisation and enclosure, and not legal ones.

I'm afraid I'm back offline for a couple of days but will try to follow the ongoing (and very valuable!) discussion.

To add my 2c:

Once we're away from traditional peer review I feel we should go the
whole hog and move to what one could term "distributed reviewing" (or
distributed filtering more generally) in which reviewing can be done
by any. See this (somewhat 'economics-y') paper from 2009:

Peter

Thanks for the distinctions, and for setting the boundary for this
important discussion, to which I agree.


Essential to science  however, is 'creative and independent thinking'
(Feynman talks about it), with that consideration I used the word creative
in previous posts..
and not in relation to 'creative works of art' which I agree would be out
of scope

Thanks for the opportunity to clarify and focus thoughts accordingly

Hello, this is a great discussion. I've been reading subsequent posts, but I've returned to this one to make my comment, not because I agree or disagree with Heather, but because it has the pertinent point I want to respond to. This does NOT directly address the narrow niche of scholarly journals, although it does touch on it a bit at the end. I'm afraid my evidence is equivocal in this debate!

I used to be Director of the Digital Curation Centre (http://dcc.ac.uk) before I retired. Very early on we established two things: we wanted to make our work open, and we were required by the terms of our grant to move towards being self-supporting. After some thought we adopted the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial ShareAlike-licence 2.5 Scotland (see http://www.dcc.ac.uk/about-us/terms-use/copyright-use-liability). It seemed right as we needed to reserve the right to charge someone for the work if they were going to make money from it.

I wanted every page to have this licence in a footer as a default. There we hit our first snag; we were often quoting or even republishing the content of others, and this content was often not CC. We couldn't work out how to do this consistently at reasonable cost. Annoying (and a bit of a muddle after a good start), but it does illustrate that unless you take some significant steps early on, there can be problems.

Did it work? Ie, did others feel able to re-use our work on the one hand? And did we earn any revenue on the other?

As far as I can tell, the DCC's work has been widely re-used. We were and the DCC probably still is pretty liberal as to what we considered commercial, so many of the activities that Peter M-R talks about we would have been happy to accept. But you would have had to ask, which rules out automated use.

At one point we employed a consultant, who later wanted to write a text book on digital curation, based partly on work he had done for us, partly on other work we had done, and partly on other work he had done. And of course, he was doing the hard work of writing the book (and clearing the copyrights; what DO publishers do for book authors?). This caused great controversy in the team, with a wide variety of quite strong opinions aired. In the end we negotiated a deal whereby the author would credit the DCC as an important source, retain all of the first part of the royalties, and the DCC would share royalties above that minimum level. By the time I left last year, the DCC had not earned any income from this source, and I was rather sceptical that we ever would.

What's the point of this story? Two that I wanted to make:

- first, a NC licence does not exclude uses of the work that might be classed as commercial. It just means you have to ask and agree the terms. Many content providers will be willing to agree (but clearly not all). Unfortunately this process is not automatable.

- second, locking material away under any kind of licence designed to earn money does not mean that it will actually do so. In other words, CC-NC often does not add much to your financial sustainability.

Over the years I have come to favour the simpler CC-BY licence, and that is what I use on my blog (and hereby apply to this post) and require from my blog commenters. But I do have the luxury of not supporting myself directly from my writing. Authors of most scholarly articles are also in that category in respect of those articles. I'm keen on CC-BY in those cases, too.

But, I have also been the editor of an Open Access journal (IJDC), one which charges zero author fees. I've got a pretty good idea of how much work is required to make a scholarly journal happen. It's non-trivial, and it's difficult to see where the resources would come from if the DCC or UKOLN were not able to provide them.

There are some areas where funding is generous and full support for OA via article processing fees may well be feasible. However, in many scholarly areas funding is much less generous, and publishers may NEED to reserve commercial rights. Even with the well-funded areas, if publishers develop hybrid revenue streams by reserving commercial rights, that might well make it possible to offer more affordable article processing fees to academia.

For example, if there is concern that people are interpreting NC as not including educational rights, then add a statement to the NC license along the lines of "Education is not commercial". Not only would this improve the NC license, in the long term I believe that this will add to support for good overall copyright licensing on an international level, as education should be understood as noncommercial, period. If CC abandons NC, I would have to abandon CC. (I would like to note that I am a strong supporter of CC today - I speak out for CC, use the licenses, encourage others to do so, and contribute to the annual donation campaign).

Thanks Chris,
This is very useful and very authoritative. The work of the DCC is hard and
appreciated.
I'll excerpt small parts for comment.

This is the key point. If humans are involved then many activities can be
carried out manually. It is the automation that is the great promise of the
electronic age.

generate a steady income by selling software, databases, etc. But generally
academics do not by default create viable business models.

This is only true if the content provider is a sole person and the creator
of the licence. If they have been passed it by some other author they have
no right to change the terms of the licence. Thus if a person deposits a
thesis in an IR under a NC licence the repository cannot remove the
restriction without consulting the author. For multi author works this is
usually impossible.

And, as you say, it's non-automatable which is the key problem. It
generates huge amounts of time loss and energy loss.

It would be interesting to know of cases where NC has actually generated
income for the author. I would be amazed if this had happened in scholarly
publishing.

Authors of most scholarly articles are also in that category in respect of
those articles.

I think this is universally true in science

If an author chooses to publish an article CC-NC outside scholpub I have no
concern
If they are in scholpub and choose to then they have a case to answer

But the most serious case is where the author is forced to accept CC-NC by
the publisher for reasons that benefit the publisher not the author.

hi Egon,

You have raised some very good points, thank you for your contribution  
to the discussion.

Some thoughts:

Allowing commercial use for untenured scholars is a splendid idea. CC  
licenses I would like to see explored:

Commercial use for the 99%
Commercial use for socially responsible companies and individual  
entrepreneurs
Commercial use EXCEPT companies that lobby for more restrictive  
copyright laws
Free use for students and teachers (this should not be called  
commercial use, because education should not be commercial - the fact  
that we are heading in this direction does not make it a good direction)
Free and unrestricted use, with respect. If you wish to use data about  
an endangered species to protect the species, go for it. On the other  
hand, if you wish to use the data to harm the species, we should be  
able to sue. Not just the author, either - anyone.


There are many open movements, and many different types of scholarly  
research and disciplines. I don't believe there is a one-size-fits all  
for licensing purposes.  For example, in many jurisdictions data has  
not been copyrightable, and I think most of us would agree that it is  
not in the interests of science to go this way.

With research data, I am all for the most open we can possibly be. In  
many areas, this means post the data on the web in a way that it can  
easily by manipulated by people or machines, with either no  
restrictions at all or minimal licensing. In the case of personal  
health data, this may mean having a server with a dedicated cable in a  
secure building within a cage, where researchers need to go through  
security procedures to get to the computer. I'm not making this up, by  
the way. If we want researchers to have access to this kind of data,  
we need to find a way to make this possible without compromising  
patient privacy.

cheers,

Heather Morrison

hi Peter,

Good points, I agree that the different types are distinct.

Even within scholarly journal article publishing, there is no  
consensus on CC licenses.

Humanities and social science researchers do a lot of scholarly  
publication, too. I would argue that there should be more humanities  
and social sciences scholarship, and publishing, and funding.

No one should spend $5,000 USD for article processing fees, period. It  
is important to consider economic sustainability of scholarly  
publishing, not just access. If a publisher asks for $5,000 USD,  
libraries and funders should say either NO, or we'll fund you up to a  
more reasonable limit e.g. $1,500. If scholars wish to publishers who  
behave like this, this is a good illustration of why we need green OA  
for the time being.

I don't think that I, or any one person or small group of people, can  
speak for all of the arts and humanities.

Most of the large commercial publishers have holdings across the  
disciplines. If we tell Springer, for example, that all their OA  
journals should be CC-BY, this impacts arts and humanities as well.  
There is increasing interdisciplinarity in scholarship. Many journals  
publish in areas that encompass sciences and social sciences, for  
example.

I am not sure that I agree with this. The green road may be the best  
approach. Pushing for CC-BY gives the big commercial publishers clout  
to go for the $5,000 license.

Heather Morrison

hi Cameron,

Comments on your blogpost:

You say that "OA is about enabling people, enabling business, enabling development". I would challenge that. This is not the BOAI vision of OA. My thesis is tentatively called freedom for scholarship in the Internet age, for a reason. Scholars should be free to challenge business. 

Since you have been in South Africa, perhaps you were at the climate change conference. If so, would you agree that some businesses (polluters) should be disabled, not enabled?

As for development, what sort of development are we talking about? If it's the kind where land and resources are taken away from local people so that local or distant capitalists can profit, then I don't see why OA should enable this at all.

What about enabling the commons, a global public sphere, or the other species we share this planet with?

I agree that there should not be a developing world CC license.

You seem to be saying that we should resist the temptation to tell the developing world what to do. Then you say that the answer is CC-BY or CC-0. This strikes me as inconsistent.

Best,

Heather Morrison

The people who are going to cheat will still cheat - the ones you'd like to use your content will be scared away. I think we do need much more evidence on the realities of what happens and how the complex mixture of licence and legal instrument and licence and social signal that we seem to have really works in practice. But in the meantime I will stick with the view that we need social and economic instruments to mitigate the risks of monopolisation and enclosure, and not legal ones.

I respect the sentiment behind these ideas, but I don't think it's
reasonable to try to encode them in a legal document. How do you define a
'socially responsible' company, for example? You'll just end up with
loopholes that can be easily exploited by the very organisations you're
trying to keep out.

The last one also sounds dangerously close to "you can only use my data if
I like what you're doing". A key part of open access in science has to be
the right to tear data apart to find faults, whether the author likes it or
not. And let's not try to implement conservation legislation through the
medium of copyright - both are complex enough issues without entangling the
two.

If you can come up with a license which only enables the uses you want
to see, and persuade other people to use it, then great.  If you want
to allow socially-useful companies, or entrepreneurs, or educational
institutions, or non-profits, to make use of your work, then you will
have to choose some other license than CC-NC, because CC-NC does not
do that.  So find yourself a lawyer and get busy.

For instance, effectively CC-NC prevents the Climate Code Foundation
from using a document to promote the public understanding of climate
science.

At the end of the day, do you care more about enabling positive uses
or preventing negative uses?

How is this commercial use? If this is commercial use under CC-NC, then CC-NC needs work.

If CC licensing is this complicated, would we be better off not using CC licenses at all?

There is so much wrong with the above that I don't even know where to start. It is mixing apples, oranges, and persimmons (for the lack of a better metaphor).

The Climate Code Foundation is a non-profit company, intending to (for
instance) train scientists, or develop science outreach materials, or
organise networks, workshops, and conferences.  All these activities
need to be funded.  For instance the CCF might be paid for its
services by an institution, a funding agency, or an NGO.  That's
"commercial", or could certainly be viewed as such by either an author
or a court.  Similarly, if we were to have adverts, or a "Donate"
button, on our blog, we could not quote from a CC-NC work in a blog
article.

License choice is of course a matter for the author, as is the
decision of whether to publish at all.

Thank you for this clarification, Nick. This helps me to understand where the current CC-NC license is problematic. Perhaps CC might want to consider "not for profit" or "no resale" options. 

Since it appears that you are advocating for CC-BY licenses, can you explain this statement I just copied from the Climate Code Foundation blog you refer to below?

My understanding is that CC have put a lot of effort into thinking
through this in the last few years, including options such as those.

That text was originally put on there by our volunteer wordpress
admin.  When the site went up it wasn't clear what sort of content
would be going on it and what sorts of licensing would be possible,
and since then my feet haven't touched the ground.  So mea culpa.
Compare with our (more-recently-minted) Science Code Manifesto site:
http://sciencecodemanifesto.org/.  PMR had a post (about similar
issues on his blog) a while ago.  While I'm in confessional mode, my
recent IEEE Software article isn't OA either.

software. Most of this is BSD licensed, and given freely. The CC-NC
license would block my usage as far as I understand it, despite
spending most of my professional time working on open source software
for use by scientists. I hope we can come to an agreement on a less
restrictive license, or at least very clear labeling so that it is
easy for me to tell gratis from libre.

The open source world has a lot of experience to offer here, and I
don't know of any OSI approved licenses with non-commercial clauses. I
hope that the open access community is able to take a similar path, so
that we can concentrate on the science.

Well said, but this needs work from all of us to make it clear why
such restrictions are unworkable. I had no idea the situation was as
bad as it appears to be.

Message-ID: <D8534097-0831-4A24-BBCC-8D664A58E03F@eln.bc.ca>

One of the arguments for open access is that is is good for business, as I wrote about a while ago:
http://poeticeconomics.blogspot.com/2005/09/open-access-good-for-business.html

The idea of scholarship as a benefit to business merits scrutiny, for a number of reasons. 

In recent decades, we have seen an encroachment of business (both corporations and processes) into the university. To some extent, this is our environment and we need to work within it. However, this is also a challenge to scholarship, and there is much to be said for pushing back rather than going along. The Edu-Factory website links to a number of the groups currently actively involved in pushback on the corporatization of the university:
http://www.edu-factory.org/wp/

More broadly, there are many who critique the neoliberal (free market) ideology of the past few decades. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, my understanding is that even some of the intellectual founders are now questioning the wisdom of this approach. The reason that this is pertinent to the present discussion on CC-BY licenses and public funding is that many of our arguments (e.g. return on investment in public funding) are very much imbued with neoliberal ideology. In some areas, this may be necessary to work with local funders and administrators, if this is all that they understand. Then too, some OA advocates may well be proponents of free market liberalism. However, not every open access advocate is a supporter of neoliberalism, and in some places there may be opportunities to push for BOTH the public good AND open access, for example through arguments centered around the public interest rather than ROI. I don't think that consensus on these political economic issues is possible, or even desirable, for the open access movement. I do think that it is important to understand that we have this diversity.

If business benefits from the public funding in scholarship, shouldn't this be a two-way street? Over the past few decades, businesses and those who benefit from them have successfully lobbied in many of our countries to reduce taxes for corporations and those who profit from them. The taxpayer access to publicly funded research argument works for businesses, too, I would argue - but only if they pay their share of taxes. 

Similarly, if business benefits from our work, shouldn't they have SOME obligation to reciprocate? In my area, data about the revenues scholarly publishers gather from our work as scholars is gathered by a company called Outsell, which charges in the range of about $800 - $1,200 for a report. As a scholar, I can't access this, even through my library, even the dollars counted on based on the work of people like me. To see what I mean, have a look at the Outsell store:

They do: the bulk of the taxes used to support public research comes 
either directly or indirectly (through the income tax paid to salaried 
employees) from commercial activity.

That is, of course, meant to be the income tax paid BY salaried employees.

In recent decades? I believe I had to pay for my education one way or another for as long as I remember it. Education is a business, and unprofitable educators should and do go down the tubes.


> To some extent, this is our environment and we need to work within it. However, this is also a challenge to scholarship, 

Why? Just because you say so? As long as the terms of funding don't influence the findings, what exactly is the challenge to scholarship?


> In my area, data about the revenues scholarly publishers gather from our work as scholars is gathered by a company called Outsell, which charges in the range of about $800 - $1,200 for a report.

If Outsell simply took your work and started reselling it, sure, you could try stop that practice with an NC clause.

However, if Outsell is actually adding some value to your work, they are well within their rights to charge a premium for that value add. If you believe you deserve a cut of that premium, negotiate with Outsell, which NC allows you to do.

Of course, by putting an NC clause, and opening up the possibility of negotiations, you might discourage Outsell from doing anything with your work. In which case neither Outsell nor you are enriched.


> If business benefits from the public funding in scholarship, shouldn't this be a two-way street?

But it *is* already a two way street. Where businesses see a benefit in paying up, they do. They routinely fund scholarships, construction of buildings, endowed chairs, projects, etc. On the other hand, if they can get certain data for free because it is fundamentally free, then they do so. We have satellite imagery collected with public monies that Google's crawlers would download for free, and as much as you might grudge them that, they are entitled to it. The richest corporation in the world has the same right to free data that the poorest sod has.


> Over the past few decades, businesses and those who benefit from them have successfully lobbied in many of our countries to reduce taxes for corporations and those who profit from them. The taxpayer access to publicly funded research argument works for businesses, too, I would argue - but only if they pay their share of taxes.


Look, licensing can't solve the world's problems. It can't make those who shirk from paying taxes pay their share correctly. It can't figure out who is socially responsible and who is not. It can't prevent work that might potentially be harmful to certain species. Well, maybe your own custom license can, but a generic licensing scheme such as CC that applies to a few billion objects on the internet can't be that specific.

If you have causes you want to espouse, insert clauses for them in your own license and be merry. Of course, your custom licensing will likely lead to potentially less uptake of your work, but caveat licensor and all that.

If NC license works for you -- great. Use it. But for most scholarship results, BY seems to offer fewer barriers for downstream uptake. In fact, I would go a step further and say -- screw it, just put it under CC0. Hey, that is exactly what I have started doing with my work.

What's the point of being the person in the cemetery with the most amount of data hoarded up?

My original conception of the idea, was to look at every publisher that
labels articles as "open access" - this exact phrase. From there, I
assessed what licence (if any) could be found to support this self-applied
label.

It's technically challenging to do. I'm not too familiar with
'publisher-space' - it's a large unknown and relatively unmapped territory
to me. I have no idea how complete my list is for instance WRT STM
publishers.

I could only find positive evidence that a few were truly Open Access (as
per the Budapest Declaration), most in my interpretation are labelled "open
access" and not really Open Access (i.e. they explicitly exclude some
uses), and for others there's simply a lack of data - I can't determine
what their policy is.

I was just going to put BMC and PLoS on for clarity and completeness
actually, and further sort out the spreadsheet to make things clearer.
Apologies if any confusion was caused, the spreadsheet is far from finished
- if you spot any errors or can make any additions, then please go ahead!

The colour highlighting that PMR suggested indicates the true Open Access
schemes / publishers I believe.

Ross

I think Marcus is right, that the software world has experience to
contribute here, so I'd like to say a few words about motivations and
schools of thought in that world.

In free software, there are broadly two schools of thought on this
question of commercial benefit, which may be caricatured as follows
(bearing in mind that there is a wide spectrum of thought and this is
just an illustrative sketch).  Both schools are motivated in
contributing by a desire that their contributions be used - helping
others who help them in return, working collectively working to solve
a shared set of problems - and each school includes many who feel that
commercial benefits should flow, at least in part, back to the
contributors.  The distinction between the schools is in the relative
strength of these motivations.

In school A, the sense of injustice of an unrewarded contribution,
when money made from a creation doesn't flow back to the creator, is
felt more strongly than the urge to contribute.  That is, school A
would rather not contribute than fall victim to such an injustice.

In school B, the sense of benefit from having one's problems solved,
and the inherent pleasure of creativity and of contribution, outweighs
this sense of injustice.  That is, members of school B would rather
that their contributions are used, even if it is to someone else's
commercial benefit with no gain to themselves.

Approximately speaking, school A chooses GPL-like licenses ("viral"
licenses, akin to CC-SA) and school B chooses BSD-like licenses (very
liberal, akin to CC-BY).

Of course, many people - including myself - feel both these
motivations, and others, in varying mixes (and there are other
orthogonal axes of distinction, such as free / open source), and many
people contribute to projects without choosing the license.  I myself
used to choose GPL-like licenses (although usually more terse examples
such as the Sleepycat license), and now greatly prefer to use BSD
licenses for my own works.

Subject: [open-science] Compiling licence details for all open access
 journals in UK PubMedCentral (or PMC)
Message-ID: <CABPM+woOp5eLPce6tn_1Cz3Ld4bwvzMxx1z7=emG8Kkf5v_-zg@mail.gmail.com>

I've just had a look at the spreadsheet for the first time since Saturday -
wow! Amazing job Ross!
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdDFzdkVNQld6Mnc5NEpGWVlRUVhvM3c#gid=0

In terms of completeness, I agree it's really hard to ensure good coverage
of the publishers and we could do with a really good list including
licences to continue with and crowdsource just the more difficult to find
details like author pays charges. Also, from Ross' spreadsheet it looks
like in many cases the licensing is journal rather than publisher specific,
particularly so with the larger publishers. As this all started with a
discussion about articles in UK PubMedCentral, I wonder if we could take
their list of full or partial OA journals, get the license data for OA
articles published in them and then work from there. The way to do this
might be:

a) Ask someone at UK PMC for such a list - any volunteers with contacts?
This is preferable as it avoids a lot of work, but if not possible...

b) Compile a list of journals flagged as open access, then search the
article metadata for a few articles from that journal to find the licences

I've included the open-biblio list for technical advice if this is our only
option! Could we:
1) Take the list of PMC journals flagged as full or partial OA (PMC journal
list with open access indicator field available as CSV here
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/#csvfile, UK PMC here
http://ukpmc.ac.uk/journalList#csvfile, probably as another format
somewhere...)
2) Query the PMC metadata (using the UKPMC-OIA tool) for OA articles (could
limit this to just a few (maybe even a single) records from each journal -
license type is an attribute so could query for license-type="open-access")
3) Extract licensing information (XML attribute
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/dobs.html#dob-license
)
4) Check for consistency (should be the same for all articles within a
journal) and tabulate the results alongside the journal record in the
journal list. We probably don't require all fields but obviously publisher
and others are vital.

We can then add in all of the excellent information Ross has collected
(which probably includes journals not indexed by PMC), which would already
cover a significant chunk

Technical people - is this feasible and is it possible in a short enough
time that it is worth it compared to crowdsourcing more content? This is
not my area of expertise so you may have a much better way of doing it than
the one I suggest above, I just worked backwards from what we want to end
up with.

Interestingly enough, the PMC XML guidance (
http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/) states:
The type of license, for example, ?open-access? for a license permitting
*unrestricted* use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided
the original work is properly cited.
(my emphasis!)

Feel free to assert that this is entirely unecessary, it depends how
complete we want our coverage to be. Being able to generate evidence across
a recognised source of OA material such as PMC or UK PMC could be powerful.
We would need to cover more journals from the physical sciences in addition
to be representative across fields, but Ross has already made great
progress on this.

Thanks all for this excellent discussion.  A few questions:

I think that explanation does a nice job of distinguishing potential
motivations from an author's perspective, though it is not entirely
clear if it extends to the publisher.   If I understood correctly, you
are asserting the groups do not differ in their personal expected
economic benefit, but only in the expected financial benefit their
work might have to others?   I'd like to be convinced that motivation
Marcus outlines in scenario A with the GPL is indeed the motivation of
the publisher to choose NC. (since economically it only makes sense in
a zero-sum game).   Do we agree that publishers cannot profit directly
by having NC and do it only out of the sense of injustice Marcus
outlines?


The other interesting issue you (and several others) raise is the
parallel between share-alike and non-commercial.  Creative Commons
explicitly differentiates between these (and adds a no-derivatives
option to boot), & Wikipedia uses the share alike clause.  While I
understand how they are legally different things, it seems we have a
provocative and convincing argument that they NC, SA, and ND are
effectively equivalent.  If not, how would you modify Marcus's
statement to reflect the analogy between SA-based software and
NC-based publications?

Comments:

Good question, Carl. Most scholarly journals today still rely primarily on subscriptions revenue - and all hybrid journals are by definition subscriptions journals. Giving away your journal for commercial purposes means that someone else can sell subscriptions to your journal, quite possibly at a lower price.

Sorry, I should have clarified.  Under Peter's description, I think
we're only discussing publications that are already view-able for
free, (what some call "open access").  Someone could already mirror
the paper for free, the difference between NC then and non-NC is
whether that other person could make money in so doing.  I'm curious
if the journal just doesn't want others making that money, (a sense of
"injustice," but not an economic incentive to keep NC) or if they
actually lose potential profit.  I doubt highly that they'd lose
profits based on lost subscription revenue based solely on mirrors of
their content driving down subscriptions.  I presume that bundled
journals are the main reason they don't lose subscription costs (the
sell to the library a subscription for many journals at a single
price, which includes a mix of stuff that is accessible and isn't),
and that protection has nothing to do with whether the elements that
are freely view-able have NC protection.


I'm curious if the journal hopes to leverage some added-value product
itself by carrying NC licenses, rather than what I see as an
economically irrelevant motive of "injustice."  For instance, if they
not only had but owned the NC license & not the author, they could
sell added value services such as text-mining, while still claiming to
provide "Open Access" (gratis access) publications (which presumably
has market value in boosting image and attracting those extensive fees
from grant agencies to "cover costs").


As a side note, I'm entertained to see that the most expensive open
access fees are charged by journals using NC licenses, which suggests
that a more permissive BY license is not necessarily more "expensive"
in terms of opportunity cost for the journal. But then the prices are
so arbitrary, only an economist could believe they have any signal of
actual costs to the journals...

I certainly used to use the GPL, but now tend toward the BSD (as does
the company I work for). I think it is important to note that there is
no NC, this goes against any of the OSI approved licenses - you cannot
place conditions on how the code is used (commercial, non-commercial,
academic only etc).

As Nick noted, there really is only rough equivalents to CC-BY, CC-SA
and CC-0 type licensing. SA is more viral, meaning that you could make
a charge to others to download the data, but they would be free to
redistribute under CC-SA for example.

Subject: [open-science] Mention of scientific data in European Commission
 communication on open data
Message-ID: <CANQ_vu2nB=FL3ijt3g_i40-TL0Y54hvs7VAu=gGjZ8r=0UZWuQ@mail.gmail.com>

As you may have seen, today EC Vice President Neelie Kroes made a big
announcement about open data in Europe [1].

The official communication [2] also includes mention of scientific information:

"5.2. Soft law for open research information. Because of the
specificities of research data, the Commission will set out in detail
and in? separate documents its strategy for scientific and research
data and associated infrastructures.? It intends to adopt in 2012 a
Communication and Recommendation on the accessibility and
preservation of scientific information. It will work with Member
States to step up their?activities to provide open access to
scientific information on the basis of a concrete set of?measures. In
parallel, the Commission will detail how it will deal with the results
of research?funded by the European Union."
Potentially very exciting!

And another mention a bit later:

"Open data for science?  * Communication and Recommendation to the
Member States on scientific?information, early 2012;?  * Expansion of
the open access pilot for scientific publications to the whole of
Horizon?2020 + pilot with open access to research data."
I like the way they've adopted the "open data for science" language,
which is much more specific that "access to scientific information".
The Horizon 2020 pilot sounds interesting...

Indeed!

I added the Beilstein Institute, with two gold OA journals, and the
Molecular Diversity Preservation International, with more than 50 gold
OA journals.

Interesting statement indeed... the unrestricted bit excludes
NC-tained licenses as Open Access...  (or did they misinterpret the
meaning of 'unrestricted' when writing up this statement?)

I think the statement is important. I do not know why PMC excludes NC
clauses as Open Access... does anyone?

Dunno about all this... sounds good, but I'm rather skeptic... all
this has too much room for, umm, interpretation... first of all, no
one really knows what open access is (!= Open Data!) ... nor what data
should be made available. Is it is enough that your figures in
publications become open access? What do we win with that...

That aside... seriously... a pilot in 2020? Really, this sounds like a
Kyoto treaty...

If the EC is serious, they should make EU-important science open, like
REACH. But all that included third-party data, which is excluded from
this press release... so, where it would actually have an impact,
toxicology/health care, nothing changes at all. On the Dutch
tweakers.net forum, someone correctly noted that many national
governmental organisations have third-parties perform studies
nowadays... all that is excluded too.

So, that leaves Open Data that governments are already making
available by themselves, and to me (please proof me wrong) it seems
that the EC is sticking a feather up their, ummm,,, hats, with
something already done by others (governments, EU projects, Open
Scientists, universities, etc).

(Please, tell me I am seeing this all too pessimistic... )

It is probably important to add the context... this quote is from a
page describing an XML language, not a normative text... the quote in
context can even be interpreted in several ways, one of which is that
the description just describes *one* possibility of an open access
license... (thanx to the person who contacted me off list, to bring
this up!)

Puneet

Not sure what you see wrong in the combined solution below, and why you
call it mixing apples and oranges

We are dealing with a complex and heterogenous issue,

Mixing different approaches and tackling problems from different angles at
a multidimensional level is necessary to address complexity

Systemic solutions are by definition, mixed approaches, and
by far the *only* valid method of addressing complexity

Right: this is an argument which the free software world had back in
the 90s, and which was decided conclusively against NC licensing.
There were various efforts to make NC licenses work, but the strength
of the free software movement (with its GPL license - emphatically not
NC) weighed against it, and the subject was finally closed when the
Open Source Definition was written.  Not that people don't try to
re-open it occasionally.

The parallel is imperfect, because many see GPL software licensing
(used, for example, on the Linux kernel) as effectively implying NC,
because it prevents the commonplace software business model (typified
by Microsoft, say) of keeping source code secret and charging people
fees to use object code.  This notion (that GPL implies NC) is refuted
by the many examples of people (authors and third parties, with and
without author consent) making money from GPL code, but it is
certainly true that GPL does require different business models.

The software world is accustomed to the notion of "work for hire": the
creators - the actual programmers - seldom have any rights over the
code they write: it belongs to some company paying for that work.  For
instance, much of my own open-source work has been under contract to a
company which decided in advance to release all that code under a BSD
license. This is one reason why it seems obvious to me that all
products (papers, data, source code, notebooks) of all public-funded
science should belong to the public, and be available for any member
of the public to use in any way without any additional payment.  We
paid for it already!

My impression of the academic publishing world is that NC licenses are
being mainly used not by academics themselves, but by publishers.  Is
this right?  That is, the scientist is still required to sign
copyright over to the publisher, and it is then the publisher who
refuses to allow others to make money from the work.  Is that correct?
 If so, does the scientist herself retain rights, or is she also bound
by the NC terms?  If my impression is correct, there's plainly no
moral argument to be made for NC: the publishers haven't created the
work - or even paid for it - so it is no injustice to them if others
benefit from it.

This spreadsheet is awesome.  Can I plea for a rearrangement, moving
the brief data columns (specifically, L "price range" and N
"journal/hybrid") towards the left, pushing the evidence columns
(F,G,K,M) to the right?  On my screen I can't view the price and the
journal columns at the same time.  The evidence columns (and maybe the
reporter column) are footnotes, in a sense.

I'd do it myself but such a major change will disrupt anyone working
with the document so should be agreed collectively (or at least
announced on-list).

I guess broadly I am one of the proponents of a broadly free market neo-liberalism. In as much as I believe markets are well suited to solving certain classes of problem that other methods we have available are not. So I disagree that green OA is a long term solution because it distorts the markets are continues the current subsidy based model which is what got us where we are (publishers don't have a business model, they have a public subsidy) whereas gold OA with APCs forces the person who actually does the effective purchasing to feel the pain. 

My answer to anyone who says that this model and arguing for CC-BY leads to $5000 APCs is to point at PLoS and BMC and Hindawi. That's the current best value market position in my view.

To answer one of Heather's important points, that I say the developing world should be free to make choices and then I suggest imposing cc-by ccZero my answer would be that I wasn't saying that we shouldn't make choices but that our choices wherever possible should enable others to make the maximum range of choices. I would argue that ccby leaves others with the widest range of choices.

I'd also make to like a side argument that NC actually can cause exactly the problems that Heather is trying to avoid. Some can argue that if we choose NC we can protect the interests of those with limited leverage by allowing them access and reuse rights in a case by case basis. But in doing this we transfer significant costs to them in having to negotiate each time thy want to talk to a new 'publisher'. The people most able to do this are the ones with the resources to overcome those frictional costs, and will help to build up cartels of 'good causes' that could prevent others ending those markets. I think this is a plausible argument that more liberal licenses make it easier for new players to enter markets and to reduce the risk of monopolies and enclosure. It is just an argument, and I think we'd need to see evidence but I wanted to make the point it could go the other way.

Finally (and I haven't read the whole of the thread yet so I am sorry if I am repeating stuff but I think a proposal that allows free terms for some type of 'white list' of good causes is both unworkable and patronizing. Again we are taking those choices away from those who should be making them by deciding what are the 'right things'. I recognize that that depends on agreement that liberal terms give people more choices.

All that said I recognize in pursuing that argument that I need to come up with count ways of preventing the kind of enclosure and monopolies that Heather is talking about. So in neo liberal terms that means maintaining a free market where the cost of entry is low and the cost of enclosure is high. Alternately in social terms it means building the norms and structures that make that unacceptable. Neither of these are straight forward and both rely on infrastructure which in many cases does not exist yet, which means that my view is that we need that infrastructure to support both the economic and social structure that would mitigate these risks. But I'd love to hear other ideas on how this can be approached. I don't feel that licensing is the right route.

This is certainly my prime motivation for challenging CC-NC for scholarly
articles. The author has no say in the choice of licence and cannot decide
how their work will be used. [Please don't suggest that the author can
bargain with the publisher - it's an artificial  monopoly situation with no
elasticity. I am one of the very small number of people who have tried to
negotiate with publishers - apart from anything their pubklishing apparatus
is so primitive that they cannot reassign rights and don't want to.]

The only negotiations - if any - that have taken place are between funders
and publishers on licence type. My guess - and I shall explore it with
public funders - is that the funders simply agree "open access" and allow
the publisher to choose whatever licence suits them - not the funders and
certainly not the authors.

The problem is not with CC licenses per we as I understand it but with the legal definition of non commercial which is complex and differs from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In fact it is the friction that this creates that is one of my personal reasons of steering clear of NC. And it's not just restricted to NC terms, trying to exclude specific uses in a licence is always fraught with difficulties. Indeed I often come across this desire and my argument against it is as follows. ou think wht you are doing is maintaining some control over your work. In fact by using a licence, a legal tool, to try and express your wishes you are actually handing complete control over the lawyers and judges, almost the exact opposite of what you want. 

To be honest we are in a bit of mess because we have this mixture of CC as legal instrument and in addition it's widespread use as a social signalling tool. The two get mixed up. My argument would be that in the case of ccby it's not such an issue because the two uses are large congruent (there are few cases that would lead you to sue over misuse of material that was released as ccby or ccZero) but they start to drift as legal and social definitions of NC and SA get mixed up. I note that some people like Pawel disagree with this assessment because of the potential issues of how attribution is supposed into be done can in principle break interoperability but I am less worried about that. Thats a risk assessment tho, not a firm position.

Peter,
The intention was to survey the types of licence used in HYBRID journals
and to allow people to judge whether the licences (and the fees) were
appropriate. It's only a few days old.

We did not add fully Open Access (gold) journals unless someone finds
examples which have CC-NC or even more restrictive examples.

Sage, Springer and others are there because I suspect they have both OA
journals and Hybrids. The comparion of licences and prices is particularly
valuable in these cases.

As I said it's a few days old and if there is material that wrong or
incomplete feel free to edit.

> What qualifies a journal to get onto this sheet?

I've taken a slightly more inclusive approach than PMR actually.

I've included more than just OAhybrid journals.

My position is that it should be a survey of all research publications
(e.g. journals, articles) that claim or self-label themselves as "open
access". Many as we have discovered are in fact NOT Open Access as per
the Budapest Declaration, despite this self-applied label.

Thus included on the spreadsheet are OA hybrid journals,publishers,
"open access" journals/publishers, and proper Open Access (Budapest
Declaration) journals/publishers.

Sometimes a publisher has multiple types of journals. So we try and
differentiate between those streams. I suggest we score only those
that are labelled "open access". Hence I should probably remove AAAS
(Science) as AFAIK I don't they claim to make any of their articles
"open access" - please correct me if you can find any though!

However, I concede there may be another interesting line of
investigation - that of journals that cleverly word their terms and
conditions so as NOT to make use of the phrase "open access", whilst
simultaneously making articles freely available and claiming that this
is in full-compliance with funding agencies such as Wellcome Trust,
NIH, NSF etc... Within the current scoring scheme of the spreadsheet
to include this might be tricky - another separate colour perhaps, for
cases such as these?

Has anyone looked into whether CC-NC is compatible with funders terms
and conditions?
I hope it is not; as we have seen in many of the discussion threads
here recently - the CC-NC license can and does harm research re-use
potential.

Regards,

Ross

All,

Cameron just said: "As an aside, this email exchange is an example of how

Was about to make this exact point. Would anyone like to start a Wiki where
we can state all relevant points with "+" and "-" summaries beneath them,
as a start? Feels like a good time to summarise where we are. This issue is
important for our open source malaria project. I just released, a few
minutes ago, the structure of a novel compound we had tested yesterday
that's about as good as chloroquine for killing the parasite.

The licence is CC-BY, and it's important we clarify that as we go forward,
so this discussion is good timing for us.

Cheers,

Mat

The analysis of "all" journals is a task that we shouldn't expect any
single person to even think about! (there are 26000 journals I think). Ross
has already spent valuable PhD time on this  and deserves huge thanks.

My motivation in suggesting this was that I or OKF could then have clear
evidence to take back to funders and show that their "paid Open Access" was
a substandard product (i.e. did not conform with the BOAI declaration or
with SPARC's present position (I hope I'm right on that)). We would then
urge funders to insist that they require at least CC-BY. My intention was
to get an OKF document that summarised the present position and take it to
funders, government, MPs, etc. When governments are requiring Open data,
why are we accepting less at great cost for science. It's even possible
that if a givernment agency published its own report it would now by CC-BY
but that in a scholarly publication it would tbe restricted to CC-NC by the
publisher.

Note that the US government has always (at least as far as I remember)
required that its publications are Open. Staff in (say) NIH publishing
papers are required to make them open and not to hand over copyright. How
much it actually happens in the pages of the journals I don't know.

Perhaps this is something that the EU could address for its agencies. Or
maybe it takes the same line as the US.

It has to be done by human/s. The concepts are too intertwined to allow
normal text processing. There's also sometimes the problem of going too
fast. Some of the suggestions are so broad that that make the discussion
very unstructurable.

For me the essential goal has been achieved - to show the prevalence of
CC-NC and similar in funded APC STM hybrid journal article publication.
Note that ir is VERY important to define the context (as I have just done).
Otherwise the discussion can range to ideas of personal freedom vs
organizations and governments.

We also have to come back to OKF's role. OKF should not duplicate licence
creation organizations. It should help people and organizations to
formulate their policies.

First - well done. (It's very different from chloroquine). Maybe discuss
this with you offlist. Note of course that the IP of the publication is
distinct from the IP of the compound or its method of synthesis. (People
often conflate open-access publication with open-access science.

I am sure you are right, and that in the cut-throat world of academic
publishing notions of justice and fair play are seldom relevant
(although they are most assuredly relevant in parts of the commercial
software world, both on their own merit and for hard-nosed motives
relating to corporate image).

I am sure that a common motive for an NC license is to allow the
copyright holder to develop and market their own "value-added"
services, as you describe.  I imagine, from experience elsewhere, that
these services are often expensive, limited, and late (when they
appear at all).

Out of interest, in cases when publishers use NC licenses, do authors
generally retain any commercial rights?

It *is* a complex and heterogeneous issue, but it is not going to be solved by bunging in unrelated things.


I would venture that the reason CC became so popular is because it offers simplicity. By *not* covering every possible edge case, it is useful for *most* of the folks around the world. 

Complicated sods like us on this mailing list will always argue back and forth of the merits and demerits of various ifs-and-whats of different licenses till the cows come home, but most of the world will move on.


As I said earlier... a license can't solve the world's problems, especially problems that are inherently subjective. 

Who decides what is a socially responsible company or an individual? Most of the time I can't decide if I myself am socially responsible. 

Who decides which companies lobby for "more restrictive copyright laws"? What is "more"? What is "restrictive"?

"Education should not be commercial"! excuse me while I clear my throat. Education is always commercial, and should be commercial... people need to be paid salaries, labs need to be fitted with equipment, campuses need to be maintained. It can't subsist on love and fresh air.

"Free and unrestricted use, with respect"? "With respect"! How do I even begin to unravel this ball of hurt?


I love what CC has done, and, what I believe, will be doing -- make licenses that are clear, easy to understand, implement, and communicate, and that cover *most* but definitely not *all* of the use-cases and kinds of information. If CC starts getting entangled in moralistic issues, that will be the end of that good-intentioned venture.

The only thing remaining then is for the rest of us to argue about which of those licenses, if any, are suitable for whatever information we are considering.

Personally, I really don't give a rat's ass about who uses my information. I love doing science, I don't want to get bogged down by licenses. Besides, thankfully, I do get a salary for doing science. 

I know for certain that I will make more money pulling shots of espresso at the local coffee shop than by trying to extract commercial value from what I create. I will continue to focus on getting my salary as I have more chance of extracting commercial value out of my knowledge and skills that make me useful to scientific ventures than from the products of my knowledge and skills.

My choice of license for my works is no license at all. Which is why I prefer CC0. Put it on, then forget about it... move on to the next problem.

See also the famous MIT style "do no evil" license,

http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/47028/how-could-we-rewrite-the-no-evil-license-to-make-it-free

I can't find the original story, but I remember that IBM lawyers
insisted on licensing the software so that they could "do evil" with
the software. It is considered non-free because it restricts your use.
If anyone with better Google skills can find the relevant link it
makes an important point - many of your everyday terms can be
ill-defined legally. Google would not host the software either, due to
the license,

http://wonko.com/post/jsmin-isnt-welcome-on-google-code

This license will never be considered free, or open due to the
restrictions it attempts to place on use. I think the majority of us
would prefer people did not do evil with the work we produce, but the
licensing is not the correct place to try to restrict this as evil is
quite subjective.

Comment:

A search of PubMed for " Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural [pt]" on December 11, 2011 yields the following percentages of fulltext:

Within 60 days of publication:  12% (this figure varies, no clear gains since 2008)
Within 3 years of publication:  66% (this figure has steadily risen from 43% in 2008)

To my knowledge, there is no way of figuring out what percentage is open access as opposed to freely available, regardless of how one defines open access.

Full data available for download from my dataverse (thanks to Harvard), at:
http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/dgoa

See the latest full data edition, 3rd tab (PMC free).

This spreadsheet is currently licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA. I have meaning to consider an appropriate data license, but have lost track of open data licensing discussions. Should I be looking at Panton Principles or an Open Knowledge license? Advice appreciated.

While I fully support and advocate for funder open access policies, there are reasons to hesitate about funders insisting on particular licenses.

It should be the author, not the funder and not the publisher, deciding on the terms of the license. That should be the aims of the author's rights movement, and this is the approach that is the best fit with academic freedom - another concept that is in need of support at this point in time.

A limitation of the public funding argument is that in many cases public funding only covers some of the costs. For example, to become a grad student, one must first be a undergrad. There are still places where post-secondary education is fully subsidized, however partial or no subsidies seems to be more common. If a grad student is paying for their undergrad education (or perhaps still carrying debt), as well as paying tuition, while working on a research project, I would argue that it is the grad student who is funding the research. If grad students are to be told how to license their work on the basis that it is "publicly funding", I would advise grad students to say, okay where is the public funding?

If we are saying that the main purpose of this research is to advance commercialization opportunities for the corporate sector, then I would argue that it is the students who are subsidizing the corporate sector.

I'm happy to see that several folks have illuminated the 
similarities--and differences--between this and much older conversations 
in the Free Software and Open Source Software communities.

Everyone loves Brand's "information wants to be free," but they neglect 
the first part: "...information wants to be expensive, because it's so 
valuable." The goal of CC-NC and GPL advocates is to use some of this 
value as leverage in achieving other noble aims: you can use our 
information *if* you also do some things that we like.

Although this copyleft approach is superficially more radical, I think 
it ultimately founders on the rocks of a rather conservative assumption: 
that I *own* the particular arrangement of bits I've conjured up. 
Despite long-established legal precedent for this understanding, some of 
us advocating less-restrictive licensing have difficulty understanding 
how this could be so.

If you take my shirt, I now have fewer shirts, and you have more. Shirts 
are scarce. But your taking my code doesn't take anything from me, 
except the *opportunity* for me to charge rent on people using my words. 
Why do I have a right to that? Just because I worked hard on something 
doesn't mean the world owes me money--trust me, as a history major, I 
know :)

Unlike actual property, intellectual "property" itself isn't scarce, 
since it can (nowadays) be infinitely copied. The expertise that 
*produced* it is. This is why many of us are excited about a scholarly 
system in which we pay directly for the valuable resource--expert 
scholars' time--and make the results free, and thus maximally valuable. 
Any approach that falls short of this, IMHO, dooms us to a world of fiat 
numerical "property," a world where we consequently value lawyers over 
libraries.

For more (and more balanced :) info on IP and its legal and 
philosophical origins, I highly recommend starting Fisher's Theories of 
Intellectual Property (cyber.law.harvard.edu/people/tfisher/iptheory.pdf).

Comment:

Traditionally, the gift in many if not most societies comes with strings attached. Marcel Mauss explores this in some depth in his book, "The gift". The reciprocal bonds that go with gift-giving is an important part of the glue that bonds families and communities. It is also in many areas the foundation of whole economic systems. In a traditional society, the rich play a role in redistributing wealth. They are expected to share.

Lest anyone think that our system is better: consider how many traditional societies (and their ecosystems) worked within these systems for centuries, while our system has led to global economic and environmental crisis. 

If I give a gift of jam, I would never put a label saying "to be eaten only by nice people", but "with love", "best wishes", or a story about the jam might well go there. And if I were to make homemade jam and put it out into the world to share with anyone, I would bring it to the Food not Bombs group, a homeless shelter, or the nearest Occupy - not a bank.

As Paolo di Maio pointed out, " We are dealing with a complex and heterogenous issue, mixing different approaches and tackling problems from different angles at a multidimensional level is necessary to address complexity. Systemic solutions are by definition, mixed approaches, and
by far the *only* valid method of addressing complexity".

The world is indeed a complex place. It may seem odd from a certain scientific perspective to mix apples, oranges, and persmissions, but in the world every apple begins with an apple tree that grows in soil with the help of water and sun, bees who help out with pollination (I think), and in an orchard hopefully loving tended by a farmer / farmer family. And the apple may well up in jam, given with love, best wishes - or at least the implicit message of eat something, I don't want you to starve.

Why does this matter in scholarship? Because scholars are part of the world, local and scholarly communities. Our long-term scholarly traditions of peer-review and citation have never needed legal language. One might argue that what we need now is more to move to a culture of sharing, rather than imposing legal licenses. 

Many thanks to Puneet Kishor and Paolo di Maio for advancing this conversation.

Open data, per se, has tremendous potential for benefits to society and the environment. I think that it is important to keep in mind that these benefits will only be realized through political will.

The UK has pulled funding for humanities and social sciences teaching, for example, and governments everywere are chopping their public services. With no social sciences, government agencies or staff dedicated to making a better social world, all the data that we can gather to help prevent and ameliorate homelessness has little potential for improving the situation.

It concerns me that last week the world's top leaders were at the Open Government conference in Brazil, skipping out of the Durban climate talks. Obama went to Open Government, while I understand that a video of a U.S. climate change denier representative went to Durban. Canada, I understand, was bullying smaller nations to pull out of Kyoto.

With political will and technological skill, including that opened up by opening up government data, I believe that we have a shot at stopping or at least limiting climate change. But without political will, this won't happen. In fact, with no political will, open data could end up just helping the polluters to find even more opportunities to do what they do.

I have (what I hope is) a clearly formulated question and I'd like
authoritative answers. Please don't offer guesses or logical solutions.

In a scholarly publication we can, in principle, identify some interested
parties:
* the author/s of the publication
* the owner of the intellectual property
* the copyright holder
* the licensor

I can imagine cases where all four are different, e.g.
* me
* my employer
* someone I have transferred the copyright to
* someone who publishes a journal

I am particularly interested in who licences the publication as this is the
legal entity that may challenge someone's use of the material. Is it always
clear? Where it is clear is it always the publisher?

brilliant question, I think, Peter

let me try to contribute by showing what we do (OA journal "Cellular Therapy and
Transplantation" http://www.ctt-journal.com)

together with our article acceptance notice we send author teams the following (plus
a three-step how-to re cc licences which seems to work well - except with a few
Western authors who seem to have difficulties imagining this new freedom...)

-->
This is the CTT Author License

Authors who publish with CTT retain copyright of their articles (? The Authors). 

Authors grant CTT a non-exclusive right to publish the final version of the work
that has undergone both the CTT review as well as the CTT Production Office's
editing procedure. We recommend that Authors provide their articles under a
Creative?Commons license of their choice. 

By agreeing to have the final version published, Authors declare that, in their
contribution, rights of third parties have not been infringed on anywhere in the
document, including tables and graphics. 

The published article may, on publication by CTT, be put on the authors' websites or
in any open repository. In such cases, we ask Authors to reference the publication
of their article in CTT (including the doi) accordingly. 

(CTT Author Licende version as of 20 March 2008)

What do you mean by "intellectual property".  It's a vague term, best
avoided.  It is generally taken as an umbrella term for copyrights,
patents, and trademarks.
And, what do you mean by "licensor"?  The copyright-holder often
issues a license.  That license may convey rights to sub-licensing.

Agreed. But it's a term often used by academic employers. They may own the
work but allow others to licence it.

I think in scholarly publishing it is almost always the publisher that
issues a licence (I don't know, that's why I am asking). If the copyright
is not held by the licensor then they are different.

And I can imagine a publisher asking a rights agency to operate a licence
on their behalf.

The point of this is that it can be complex and we may have to know the
answer. In which case the publisher should make this clear.

"Own the work" meaning "own the copyrights"?  Or is there something
else to own?  My point is that, in any specific circumstance,
"intellectual property" means something specific, and so when
discussing specific circumstances it is better to be explicit about
the specific property in question.  For instance, the copyright on a
scientific paper.

I'm not surprised if many academic employers assert ownership of such
copyrights: most employers assert ownership of copyright on work
products, either explicitly in an employment contract, or implicitly
by custom, or under a 'work for hire' rule.  But then what happens
when a publisher requests an author for copyright assignment?  In the
simple three-party case (institution, author, publisher)?  Does the
author pass the form up to some institutional office, where it is then
exercised on behalf of the institution?  That is, are the copyrights
assigned by the institution to the publisher?  Or does the author fill
in the assignment form himself (which he is presumably not entitled to
do, and which therefore invalidates the assignment, so copyright
remains with the institution and the publisher actually gets nothing
and could probably sue the academic for fraud)?  Or maybe the
copyright remains with the institution and what the publisher gets is
a license?  Maybe academics are implicitly or explicitly empowered to
grant such licenses on behalf of their institution?

In many universities to copyright resides with the employer. In some
countries there is a concept of authors'-moral-rights which I think resides
with the person who actually wrote it (unless it was a work for hire).  So
it's complex before we start

I think all of these amay be true in some places and false in others...

This sort of problem hasn't been tested because most authors don't care.But
I bet the legal ground is shaky in places.

Moral rights cannot be sold or assigned, they always reside with the
author (and I think this means the actual author, not the employer).
There are no moral rights to software, at least in the UK, so I know
less about them.

There are still places where post-secondary education is fully subsidized, however partial or no subsidies seems to be more common. If a grad student is paying for their undergrad education (or perhaps still carrying debt), as well as paying tuition, while working on a research project, I would argue that it is the grad student who is funding the research. If grad students are to be told how to license their work on the basis that it is "publicly funding", I would advise grad students to say, okay where is the public funding?

Does an analogous argument apply to graduates working in the private
sector?  If not, why not?  Their work products require their skills
which are similarly based on their education, which someone (usually
the graduate or a government) has paid for.  Are they entitled to a
share of the work products based on that subsidy?  Or is it assumed
that their salary pays for their skills?

Subject: [open-science] Six issues with licensing
Message-ID: <4D790922-AC37-43E9-B955-FB7CF3B197FB@eidesis.org>

A lot of entangled issues arose in the thread started by Peter Murray-Rust instigated by Heather Morrison's blog post. I have tried to tease out six issues from that thread --

1. Whether or not CC should offer choices of licenses such as NC and ND?

I believe yes, because they offer a valuable choice to potential users who would otherwise not consider CC at all.

2. Whether or not I should personally use such licenses?

That is a personal choice, and everyone should be free to make that choice. Personally, I don't like and use such licenses because... read on...

3. Do such licenses discourage downstream uptake?

I don't have any scientific evidence of this but I believe they might. I choose to not use such licenses to avoid that possibility.

4. Do such licenses really enable us to enforce our personal desires/viewpoints on others?

Again, no scientific evidence, but my guess is "no." On the other hand, this guess is applicable to all licenses. There is absolutely no guarantee that anyone will comply with any kind of license, and there is always the possibility that someone will be discouraged by any license one chooses.

I simply don't have the resources (time, energy, motivation) to chase anyone who might have violated my licensing terms.

5. Should I discourage other individuals from using such licenses?

I believe this is a personal choice. I do choose to discourage other individuals from choosing such licenses because of my unscientific but reasonable beliefs #3 and 4 above.

6. Should I/we discourage other organizational entities from using such licenses?

Ahhh... Finally something that can actually be debated. Again, based on my beliefs 3 and 4 above, I think collectively we should discourage organizations from choosing NC and ND licenses. Put another way, we should encourage organizations to choose BY or CC0. CC0 and BY increase interoperability between datasets by lowering the impedance to mixing data. CC0 is especially suited for data. BY for interpreted content may be the best in most situations as it gently conveys the author's desire to be attributed without carrying any other constraint. 

I believe that encouraging people to do the right thing is more effective in the long run than trying to discourage them from doing the wrong thing. CC gives us the means for pursuing both options. I choose the former, but do understand that not everyone shares my reasoning.

The concept of "intellectual property" is a recent invention, and a concept that should be challenged moreso than clarified, for example through the counter-concept of the commons. See some of the works by Lessig, Boyle, Vaidhyanathan, Ostrom, Bollier, among others.

SFU recognizes intellectual property rights as belonging to the scholar, a good model in my opinion which others should emulate. Adopting a Harvard-style mandate can help us to move in this direction, from my perspective.

To summarize, I don't think we should be pinning down intellectual property rights at this point in time, but rather opening up discussion about whether this is a useful concept at all, and if so, how it should be defined.

In Latourian terms, much as we love our black boxes that conceal so much of the world's complexity for us, it is not time to close this particular black box just yet.

Best,

Heather Morrison

Certainly I agree with this, and I have been challenging the term
'intellectual property', as I have on this list, for about 20 years.
However all of us also have to operate in the current legal milieu,
and an understanding of the law helps in that.  There are many who
believe that copyright itself is a dated and toxic legal fiction, but
while working for its abolition they would be well advised to
understand it, so that they might know the reach (and the limits) of
the law as it now stands.

For example, I think that I should be able to freely share
publicly-funded science papers, in any manner and for any purpose, and
I argue for the changes necessary for me to legally do that
(essentially, a well-defined and enforced OA mandate from funding
agencies).  In the meantime, it is important for me to know that I
could be sued for doing so.  In fact, publicising this fact is an
important part of the argument, as it highlights the fact that the
current system exposes many (or even most) working academics to legal
action.

Subject: [open-science] How CC-BY can become TA
Message-ID: <E1F10441-793B-4C13-9520-343C3CAF35A5@eln.bc.ca>

The following is meant as just one example of what I see as a serious vulnerability that CC-BY brings to OA, and why I so strongly oppose defining OA as CC-BY.

There are businesses that sell academic jounal articles on a for-profit basis (document delivery services). Here is just one example:
http://www.researchsolutions.com/?gclid=CNLF8cCQgq0CFQSFhwodwGurRg

If a journal or author uses the CC-BY license, these services can sell these articles, too. If anything happens to the original OA copy, then there is a realistic possibility that the only way to access the copy will be to pay these charges. 

These businesses have every incentive to work to eliminate the free competition. This is how businesses work! Businesses like this (and our regular commercial for-profit scholarly publishers) are lobbying at an international level to eliminate traditional library interlibrary loan services, for example. They can use business-friendly trade agreements to challenge any public support for open access. If we can be sure that there is a strong and healthy public sector into the future, public and academic libraries with a mission of public service, there would be no worries, as this sector could look after ensuring ongoing OA. However, libraries and public services everywhere are under threat as well. Canada's national science library, for example (CISTI), recently underwent a 70% cut, including the provision of cost-recovery document delivery, on the grounds that the commercial sector can provide this service. 

This is just one example of how CC-BY can become TA.

But with the internet, 'the original OA copy' is irrelevant. Anyone can
provide it on the web - the author, their institution, researchers building
their own bibliography, bloggers commenting on the piece, and so on. The
bandwidth costs for a typical academic paper are already negligible, and
will only get cheaper.

I appreciate your point that businesses will work to cut off free
competition, and I agree that there's a real danger of them doing that with
paper-based document delivery. But the open-access question is primarily
for new content being generated today, which is invariably available
electronically. It's inconceivable that they could cut off legal document
sharing on the internet, even with the most pro-business government. They
can hardly control *illegal* redistribution of music, even with laws like
the American DMCA in place.

In my view, the problem ultimately may have to do with establishing a
"canonical" / authoritative form of the original
paper?  A form that is held by a trusted repository (other than the author)?

This is where the volatility of digital media createds rsik to the
traditional practice of scienitific publishing?

Even the publishers, who have the most sensitivity to this topic, don't 
raise this as a problem. One would imagine if it were a meaningful issue 
in OA, the publishers - who have real economic losses to bear from it - 
would have made it front and center. So I'm not worried about imaginary 
economic losses to authors who currently make no cash anyway.

The place where open articles are archived is the role that can protect 
us in this space. Whether it's dataverse, LOCKSS, or even the Google 
cache, there's any number of non-institutional systems that 
systematically archive articles. And then you've got libraries, which 
are increasingly going to provide this service for their faculty members.

Anyone who pays for a CC BY article is paying a tax for being bad at web 
search.

I think this is a great quote.

However it is not always that simple. As long as the amount of open access
remains small there is always the likelihood that OA articles are bundled
into portals and offered for sale. I discovered two cases of my own OA
article being resold for substantial amounts of money:
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2007/09/03/oup-wants-me-to-pay-for-my-own-open-access-article/
If people access the Toll-access offerings through portals then this is an
ever-present danger. For example in 2007 the British Library resold my open
access articles unless you actually visit the library - it is simpler to
charge everybody rather than check permission  (please correct me if this
has changed).

BTW no licence would stop this unless I wanted to take the BL or others to
court.

The sad fact is that most OA advocates do not police practice and probably
don't care, so we have to do what we can as individuals to find the worst
violations. In academia we do not care about pointing the rest of the world
to self-archived copies - it only affects the scholarly poor - we in
scholarly rich universities can find the literature through our toll-access
subscriptions. I would feel more strongly about supporting GreenOA if we
actually built an index of it - it's not fair to expect the scholarly poor
to traverse the tangle of badly organised "free" publications.

The problem with this is the CC branding issue (and the very name:
"Commons" suggest all this stuff forms a commons when in fact it
doesn't. If CC were named Liberal License Choice or similar there
would be a less of an issue -- though the name wouldn't be as nice).
Specifically, to lots and lots of general users there is, nowadays,
just "CC" the "brand/general thing" not this or that specific license
(I can produce lots of examples of sites that, at least in there text,
just say something like "CC licensed" not "CC Attribution licensed
[1]). This means that many users are choosing "CC" not the license
and, for them, there isn't a great difference between NC-ND and BY as
they are all "CC". As such, restricting the options CC provides to,
say, only open licenses would have a big impact.

For more on this see:
<http://rufuspollock.org/2011/04/12/creative-commons-and-the-commons/>

[1]: as one example of this see the Pro Public data discussed in
http://thedatahub.org/dataset/us-gov-tarp where the statement is "this
is Creative Commons licensed". You have to click through to the source
license to discover this is NC-ND (despite their stated encouragement

Sure but we have seen that once a field matures such enforcement does
happen and can be useful (I'm thinking here of GPL enforcement --
where the individual action problem has been solved in a standard
manner by clubbing together sharing that effort in a specific
organization such as the FSF).

:-)

Put another way, we should encourage organizations to choose BY or CC0. CC0 and BY increase interoperability between datasets by lowering the impedance to mixing data. CC0 is especially suited for data. BY for interpreted content may be the best in most situations as it gently conveys the author's desire to be attributed without carrying any other constraint.

I think for data we obviously should add to the list the PDDL, and
also IMO, ODC-By (http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/)

Very well stated Puneet and thanks for this reasoned setting out of the options.

I've had an idea like this in the back of my mind for a while. When you're
denied access to a paper on a journal website, it would be great to have a
browser plugin to search institutional repositories etc. for the same
paper. A sort of alternative DOI resolution system. Obviously there's some
technical challenges in that - and the publishers probably wouldn't cheer
for it - but it seems worth exploring.

It's technically straightforward - socially very challenging. For many
years we have had a Greasemonkey plugin which can recognise material in web
pages and act upon it. The difficulty is, without an addictive viral model,
getting it adopted. Mendely could do it if they wanted.  I have ideas but
I'm not ready to go public yet.

Here a reply from Stevan Harnard, the GreenOA guru to the question whether
index of GreenOA exists or not, which might be a little contribution to the
debate.

Donat

 

......

Dear Peter and Stevan

 

"I would feel more strongly about supporting GreenOA if we actually built an
index of it"

 

I always thought that this is or is happening within these two

The two leading lists of OA repositories around the world are the Directory
of Open Access Repositories <http://www.opendoar.org/>  (OpenDOAR) and the
Registry of Open Access Repositories <http://roar.eprints.org/>  (ROAR).

 

Or does this index really not exist - this then would be the same problem we
face in taxonomy, where have no clue what we published since 1758 the start
date of zoological taxonomic literature that we need to consult to make sure
our names are correct.

 

Dear Donat,

 

Yes, ROAR and OpenDOAR are indexing Green OA in that they track the
repositories as well as their content (though the content cannot yet be
sorted reliably by full-text/metadata-only, and
peer-reviewed/non-peer-reviewed, but only by indirect indicators such as
document-type and size).

 

More important, the all-important annual ratio of institutional deposits to
total annual institutional peer-reviewed research output is not being
tracked, for the simple reason that institutions don't yet know their total
annual research output! They have no mechanism for monitoring it. In fact,
OA repositories will become that mechanism -- but only after it has been
mandated that they must deposit it all! 

 

Keith Jeffery's CERIF and CRIS's would do this, but they need to be adopted
to do so.

 

So, yet again, it is Green OA mandates that are needed most, not Green OA
indexes.

 

(Yassine Gargouri has been periodically measuring the ratio of annual
ISI-indexed institutional output that is Green and Gold OA, and will shortly
post some results. And the EU has called for proposals to develop a
long-term mechanism for measuring this ratio.)

 

Cheers, Stevan

 





 

Cheers

 

Donat

I looked today and ROAR is only an index of repository type (i.e. you
cannot search for content). DOARhas been broken for 3 days according to its
website. It only appears to be searchable on simple strings (not metadata).

At present only a very small (<5% of the scientific literature is
self-archived in IRs). Unless people are actually able to use them to get
stuff out they aren't going to be keen to put stuff in voluntary. I know,
it happened to me.

Not so sure about that: the reason we care about open is because it
facilitates sharing and reuse (we're not into openness just for its
own sake).

At least regarding science I think the two orgs are even closer than
that (in fact CC may be even stronger on 'open' than OKFN in that, as
I understand it, CC's default position for science data is public
domain only).

One way to think about it is that the OKF position is driven by a philosophical commitment to the idea and value of open stuff, as expressed in the open knowledge definition, whereas the Science Commons position was driven very strongly by a focus on inoperability. This meant that for instance OKF was philosophically committed to the notion of making it possible to have data licenses that matched the OD (including share alike and attribution) while the SC position arose out of a looking at what would make things most interoperable and concerns over risks about non interoperability lead to eg the recommendation for PD for data. It's a lot more complex than that but I think that gives some insight into how the various views developed.

Thanks for the comments, Rufus and Cameron - I agree with them, and I
had emphasized the proximity of both organizations, but people were -
in that introductory discussion - nonetheless more interested in the
differences between the two, and when forced to use just one word to
describe the focus of each, I think I was not too far off (in his talk
on the state of data governance in the social sciences, Micah Altman
came up with the following:
one-word summary: good
two-word summary: Not good
three-word summary: Not good enough).

Anyway, the meeting is over now, and since the notes have largely been
taken on paper or by way of rapporteurs, I don't have much to post
yet. Will get back on that, though, as there are numerous avenues of
the discussion that have strong overlap with OKF activities.

Cheers,

Daniel

Message-ID: <863C7630-02F0-4766-95AB-E46AFC7DD059@eln.bc.ca>

The Bielefeld Academic Search Engine cross-searches over 30 million documents from over 2,000 repositories:
http://base.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/en/

Then there are the subject-specific search services, such as PubMed, arXiv, E-LIS, the Social Sciences Research Network, and the search services built on the RePEC repositories. In some disciplines such as physics and medicine, these indexes are THE place to search.

There are people who advocate for the development of a public search engine for open access scholarly research, including Mark Leggott (Discovery Garden) and Rowly Lorimer (SFU Master's program in publishing).

The devil in the details: of course we need the mandates, but succeeding in getting mandates is not an excercise in rationality or logic; it is a move fraught with a large amount of institutional politics. Because of this, anything that helps the politics of the debate move closer to a mandate is helpful. Focusing only on the mandate does not necessarily help this process. Not forgetting the mandate is the important point but more attention should be placed on practical tactics to reach this particular goal. And, of course, there are other possible goals that also help OA to move forward. They too require effective tactics.

It's not "Mandates, not indexes." 

It's that we won't have anything to index until/unless we mandate!

> Surely both are needed, and are mutually reinforcing. You improve the chances of mandates if it can be shown that existing repository content is being used more. At what point in the growth of mandates do we concede the need for better repository services?

When the repositories have enough content to make better services worthwhile. You can't squeeze blood out of a stone. While IRs are near-empty of OA content, there's next to nothing to search on, and certainly nothing to crow about.

My response was actually to Peter Murray-Rust who wrote: 

> "I would feel more strongly about supporting GreenOA if we actually built an index of it - it's not fair to expect the scholarly poor to traverse the tangle of badly organised "free" publications."


This may make PM-R -- a crusader for open data, and for libre OA that ensures article harvestability and data-crunchability by data-base services -- feel more strongly about OA. 

But what is actually needed to get researchers to provide OA is OA mandates, not indices or even navigational tools to "traverse the tangle of badly organised 'free' publications."

The trouble with that tangle is not that it is badly organized but that it is mostly non-existent.

Every year, maybe every month, one hears someone say that "there won't be OA, or they won't provide OA, or OA will not be useful -- until/unless X" (substitute for X anything you like: indexes, navigational/analytic tools, richer metadata, copyright reform, reliable digital preservation, Gold OA, whatever you like).

My reply, always, is that there is one thing, and one thing only, that is needed in order to have 100% (green) OA, and that is immediate-deposit (no delay, no waiver, ID/OA) mandates, adopeted globally by institutions and funders.

If we keep on believing and waiting upon all the X's that people propose instead, we will wait for more needlessly lost decades.

(On the other hand, whenever anyone states clearly that the overwhelming priority is to mandate OA, and that, in addition, X too would be welcome, I happily applaud.)

> What is the current rate of growth of mandates? Might it have slowed?

Yes, it has.

> If so, why might that be?

I'm not sure, but I think it's for two main reasons: 

(1) distraction by and diversion to X's (the two main distractions being publishing reform (gold OA) and copyright reform) 
and 
(2) the adoption of ill-thought-out and ineffective mandate models.

I hope, fervently, that this will now be remedied by Bernard Rentier's and Alma Swan's  newly chartered EnablingOpenScholarship, created specifically to give institutions reliable guidance on how to formulate and implement their OA mandates. http://www.openscholarship.org

> Perhaps it is because institutions will get progressively hard to convince (the early adopters will presumably have been the easiest to persuade). Maybe some of them are asking the same sort of questions about repositories as Donat.

There is no question that institutions (and funders) are hard to convince. That's why a concerted global effort to convince them, based on clear, well-thought-out, tested methods is so very much needed. And I hope EnablingOpenScholarship will provide just that.

> The OA repository world should not stop to wait for mandates, it should be developing on every front. Instead, repositories are developing on other fronts, just not necessarily OA #jiscmrd

Yes, through their entire decade of existence, OA repositories have been developing on every front, just not OA.

And that's the point. 

Please, let's not lose another decade like that.

Mandating OA is the only way to achieve OA. As long as we keep running off in every other direction, we will get everywhere else, but not to OA.

Like all of us on this list, I too have been thinking about OA for a long time, but the recent question about the link between OA, data mining, sinking servers, and hence, a possible need for an exception in the legal obligations has brought to mind once again the mechanism for enabling OA. 

The desire to be open has to be supported by the capability to be so. Every time I put out a link to one of my data applications on any one of the various programming lists, I can see the process monitor spike up as my server is hit by a barrage of queries. I have unlimited bandwidth, and a pretty capable, top of the specs computer, but it does start sweating and breaking stride. So, it makes sense that if I were using and creating hundreds of GB of data, and serving processes that were very compute-intensive, I wouldn't be hiding all the data behind a pokey dial-up line and a 5 year old computer with an incapable operating system. 

But, what if I didn't build into my project the cost of making OA possible? As I like to say, free is very expensive. If all of the project funds are devoted to science, there will be no money to make OA possible, and conversely, if all the funds are devoted to OA, there will be no money for research. There is a sweet spot somewhere that balances the funds between doing research and making its data and results available freely to everyone. Some of us call it the Warnick Curve (another story).

So, the question -- can we genuinely plead inability to make OA possible because we have inadequate capacity? Or, we should have built in the cost of OA into the research proposal in the first place so we couldn't hide behind such an excuse? In other words, we have no business doing complicated research with lots of data using public monies unless we also think of the continuing costs of making it all available. 

Of course, we have to define "available," but that is another rant.

I think it's worth distinguishing OA for documents and document-sized data
and OpenData with hundreds of gigabytes per project. Also distinguish
between "final snapshots" and ongoing dynamic data.

I doubt that publishing manuscripts, diagrams, excel spreadsheets etc. is a
major hit. And I suspect that most institutional repositories would be
delighted to have something to put in their pot. An *institution* that
canot manage shouldn't be in the game. I agree there is a potential problem
for people without institutions but I doubt this is a problem.

It's more difficult when there are zillions of files or they are huge.
Again if these are in anyway institution-related you should try them.

Having said that I don't think data should generally be at institutions and
this is a problem that the domain or the country should solve. Dryad,
Tranche, etc. are doing a good job of looking after data. I think there has
been talk of a modest charge. Data costs money, but given the emphasis by
research funders solutions should be emerging

(I do not see conventional publishers as being the solution - generally
they have no expertise in data management).

If it's institutional or national then it's their responsibility to provide

The data doesn't have to be on your own server.  There are many services 
including peer-to-peer which have been able to solve this problem for 
years.  "I don't have enough bandwidth" is not an excuse.

Yes.  I saw "Unknown" and took it as one more sign that OA was becoming
mainstream.  I believe the good guy wanted to make some data open and the
bad guy wanted to stop him.

Another example:  an episode of "Leverage" from the summer of 2011 focused
on an "open-source potato" and an effort to share the data about it.  Sorry
I don't have a link or additional details.

I think part of the problem here may be in failing to properly see this 
as a problem of marginal accounting. The money spent openly 
disseminating  data is in most cases a tiny fraction of that spent 
gathering it in the first place. The marginal cost of openness is quite low.

However, the payoff of actually letting people see your valuable data 
(both for its creators and for society at large) is quite large, 
compared to the payoff of letting it moulder in your closet. Openness' 
marginal benefit is very high.

Since open dissemination turns you a tidy marginal profit, then, the 
extra scratch is well spent, and the rational actor's choice. Of course, 
as others point out, even more rational is to let a specialist 
repository take care of all this.

Hi All

If you're in Sao Paulo on 28th December, members of the OKFn Brazil chapter
and myself are having an open science meetup over what I'm assured will be
excellent pizza. Check out the meetup listing below for more details:
http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/Sao-Paulo/555732/

Hope to see you if you're in the area and do let us know if you organise
any open science meetups in your own area!

Thanks - very useful.

It would be useful to have similar (real) figures about Green Gold, libre

Peter - this is exactly my argument. I have nothing against Green, but it
cannot give the permissions we need to do modern informatics-based science.
The question is how we change it. I think *some* publishers do not realise
the problems with non-libreOA and may change if given rational evidence. If
we can get a few to flip, then we might make slow but constant progress.

I'd like a place where this strategy can be discussed rationally without
being swamped with GreenOA assertions and ill-thought-out assertions about
how authors want CC-NC. Every funder I have talked to would like completely
libreOA and - within limits - is prepared to pay for it. How one fixes
prices in an artificial monopoly is a problem of politics, not economics.

Agreed. Pubmed has ca 20 million articles. Many of those don't even have
publicly visible abstracts. Of the rest only 1% are OAlibre and that is the
only amount that we are allowed to index, mine, serach for images,
transform data, etc. I don't think people in A&H have any idea what a loss
the full article is to a modern informatics scientist.
