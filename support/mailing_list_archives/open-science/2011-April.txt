Message-ID: <18965D04-07C2-45BB-B2E7-089877ACCACC@okfn.org>


Dear all,

As you know, we're busily preparing the schedule for this year's OKCon, which is going to be in Berlin on the 31st June and 1st July. We're really excited about this year's event - so much has happened in the last 12 months! We're really hoping you guys will be up for having a meet-up scheduled in, so you can get together face-to-face and chat about the amazing work that you've been doing over the past year and how we can push forward with the next one. Are there times/days which are better or worse for people? 

Also, it would be *fantastic* to have presentations, workshops, discussions or lightening talks from people on this list - there's so much activity in the field, it would be great to get a bit of a taster of all your work.

I've attached a short PDF version of the Call for Participation, and if you haven't already seen it you can check out the full version at 
	
	http://okcon.org/2011/cfp/

The submissions form is at http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

Looking forward to meeting lots of you in Berlin! 

Also registration is open at: registration: http://okcon2011.eventbrite.com/

All the best,
Daniel

Subject: [open-science] Speaker for a virtual talk to a EU FP7 project
	cluster on Open Data licenses?
Message-ID: <BANLkTiknFL-jMe3oykfonP15d-HDGU0EJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

as some of you know, I recently started working on the ToxBank.net
project, which is going to facilitate data analysis in a cluster of
six
EU FP7 projects called SEURAT-1
(http://www.eurtd.com/seurat/kick-off/index.php). I would guess the
whole cluster involves in between 200 and 300 scientists. (SEURAT :=
Safety Evaluation Ultimately Replacing Animal Testing).

In this community too there is a lot of misunderstanding about Open
Data. Common issues involve questions like:

* do I have to make everything Open?
* can someone else make my data Open? (e.g. in the form of: "doesn't
the Consortium Agreement disallow me to make data Open from
partners?")
* what about attribution? "stealing" of data

And they generally do not see what advantages it has for them:

* more exposure of their work
* simplifying collaboration

Another aspect is the following. This week I learned that there exist
EU laws around toxicology that makes data a commodity, and that
companies that measured data, have a legal ownership of that data, so
that this has value when materials are sold (seriously!). It is
similar to like CO2-emission right markets. It was argued that this is
the EU solution to getting industry to do the required safety
analysis. At this moment I do not yet have the details on this, but
have requested them with the person whom I've spoken with about this.
(I'll follow up on this as info comes in.)

Clearly, this aspect doesn't make me happy, and EU regulation around
these kind of EU projects most certainly do not seem to make the
situation around Open Data more clear.

Now, there is a serious interest in the Data Analysis Working Group in
this SEURAT-1 cluster for a talk on Open Data, and how that works for
them when participating in EU projects.

Is there someone in the OKFN that could give such a virtual talk /
webinar to this public? Being part of the science working group, I
know a bit about things, but I am sure there are far more
knowledgeable people around.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

greetings,

Egon

CC is of course also happy to contribute a talk if that is of interest (hi,

and licenses too :)

Early May works for me for a virtual meeting. We've done a ton of stuff 
in and around toxicity between our Neurocommons work and, more recently, 
via Sage Bionetworks (Congress is late next week) and the "proof of 
concept clinical archipelago" (see 
http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110302/full/471017a.html) both of which 
are angling to get lots of tox data out into the commons under either a 
public domain regime or creative commons licensing.

You should definitely take advantage of Rufus' offer to present at that 
meeting as well.

I won't be at BioIT World - we've moved SC west to the Bay Area and 
integrated it into Creative Commons proper, so you'll see less and less 
of the Science Commons moniker. If you're out here drop me a line.

Dear All

I'm very sorry, but something has come up and I will no longer be able to
host tonight's Skype meeting. In the absence of anybody already signed up on
the pad who I can ask to take over, I'm afraid the meeting is cancelled.

We'll have a bumper meeting next Month (Wednesday 11th May, same time, same
place) to catch up, and in the meantime if you have anything you'd like to
talk about, projects to propose or events/articles of interest you'd like to
flag up to the group then please email out to the mailing list
open-science at lists.okfn.org and let the discussion commence!

Definitely interesting.  The article also didn't mention PaleoDB (
http://paleodb.org/), one of the main international data sharing efforts in
paleontology, crossing all taxa, with replica sites in Australia, Germany,
and two sites in the US.  Its a voluntary effort, so differs somewhat from
the journal mandated sharing described in the article, but still I would
think it deserved a mention.  Its quite a bit more targeted than MorphBank
for this topical area.

Do you know if the Open Dinosaur project is contributing their specimen
measurements to the broader PaleoDB?

Getting these types of data repository systems to interoperate, expose data
to each other, and be able to provide persistence and replication services
to each other are some of the goals of the DataONE federation (see
http://dataone.org).  Dryad, mentioned in the article, is one of the
founding nodes in DataONE. If DataONE is successful, when researchers choose
to use one repository for their data, they won't be contributing to a single
repository, but rather to a federation that allows data to persist beyond
the lifetime of the individual repository project they choose.  Seems pretty
compatible with OKFN goals to me.

I've had a couple of chats to Ross Mounce who was the instigator of the open letter that tipped off this article. He's aware of (and involved with) Dryad UK and I also pointed him in the general direction of OKFN. Given his main focus at the moment was data to do with published articles Dryad (and DataONE) seem like a good place to start for him. His main task really is getting a bit more community backing behind the idea that _something_ needs to be done and he seems to be doing a good job on that.

Cheers

Cameron

Subject: [open-science] (Lack of) data sharing for fossil data
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=WKOuwTG8xsgeLsqCe5UGGBKj=Jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been quietly lurking on this list for a few weeks now. Seems like an
excuse to say "hi"

The motivator for the Nature piece was a long thread on the PaleoNet mailing
list discussing an Open Letter http://supportpalaeodataarchiving.co.uk I
co-organised to demonstrate support from *within* the paleo-community for
better data archiving. Ewen picked up the story from there and decided to
spin a story out of it - great! You might be interested to know that we
drafted and organised the Open Letter on an EtherPad - an idea I entirely
'stole' from OKFN pads i'd seen ;)

I'm particularly pissed off that when data is published [sic] in
supplementary materials it's regularly corrupt / unusable / obfuscated /
near useless... etc and one has to then run the gauntlet of contacting the
original authors, which I hope we all know has decidedly mixed success rates
(e.g. Wicherts et al, 2006), not to mention the additional hassle for both
parties.

This is what I'm aiming to change in particular - the way in which
underlying data that supports a research article is made available, in the
systematics [~phylogenetics] and palaeontological communities.
My first attempt at pitching this idea to the systematics community was very
well received:
http://prezi.com/1s0lkatmc30t/the-continued-growth-of-phylogenetic-information/
However it was given at a small conference (Young Systematists' Forum) so it
hasn't had anything like the impact of the paleo-focused Open Letter.

The Open Dino project people are awesome, and there are actually many many,
other people as I've recently discovered, in the paleo-community that want
more Openness of research data.

Just one further note - I'm going to be at the Linked Open Data EBI
short-course in May soon.
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Rebholz-srv/semantics_WS_May2011.html
Do let me know if you're around then in the evening - I would really like to
integrate / meet a bit more of the open science community, and I know a fair
few of you are Cambridge-based... just a thought ;)


*waves hello*

I am trying to fight this. There are some publishers who are good (IUCr,
BMC, EGU/ACP, etc.), some who do not check the quality of the material and
so it's up to the authors, some who do not check but copyright it (ACS) and
some who refuse to publish any suppdata (J. Neurosci).

It's a human problem, not technical in most cases. It requires the corporate
will of the publishers and senior editors. In some areas such as Proteomics
the editors have prevailed and force data to be deposited. It's very
domain-variable.

You are certainly doing the right thing by working with OKFN. At the least
you will find people who share your views. When you are losing heart and
wonder what is wrong there are others who share the same burden. Yes, it's a
burden, and a partial lifestyle. But we believe in the simple idea that if
work is publicly funded then the results should be public.

The semantic problems you allude to are harder. PDF is an abomination in
science - it has no role. We're trying to develop scholarly HTML as the
right way to communicate science. It will need critical mass but we are as
always optimistic.

This is an n^2 effect (or even higher power). Everyone like you enhances
*our* power and determination. The dam is starting to crack but it needs
constant work on our part. Probably at this stage it's worth sticking to a
fairly clear message - don't try and solve everything at once.

We are writing Panton papers on some of these areas and it may well be that
Panton Prezis would be a great addition!

Ross and others on this thread,

Keep in mind that successful open data schemes for the geosciences  
will depend on open standards for web service interfaces and encodings  
as well as open metadata standards. See, for example, how the  
international OneGeology (http://www.onegeology.org/) project has used  
OGC interface and encoding standards and ISO metadata standards.

Ocean observation, meteorology and hydrology stakeholders with  
interests like yours have created domain working groups (http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/wg 
) in the OGC to focus their efforts to create international consensus- 
derived profiles of standards relevant to their activities. The  
meteorology and oceanography working group brought their pre-existing  
netCDF standard into the consortium to harmonize it with OGC standards  
and make it an OGC-maintained standard.

What's missing are some key standards for web services that will  
support access policy decisions (not a simple matter, as those damned  
mercenary fossil hunters illustrate!), and best practices that will  
make implementations of those standards useful to practitioners. See  
the work of the GeoRM and Security domain working groups at the link  
above.

PDF, no. HTML, no.

XML, yes.

Every domain needs a metadata council. Ultimately, it's about profiles  
of the ISO metadata standards and web service interfaces for catalogs  
that enable the xml-encoded ISO standard metadata -- and links to the  
data (and data processing services) -- to be published, discovered,  
assessed, accessed and used. See, for example, the Marine Metadata  
Interoperability Project (http://marinemetadata.org/). Ultimately,  
this approach enables chaining of web services in models that draw on  
multiple remote resources.

This looks like a good opportunity to discuss different ways of viewing the
problem.

Chemical Markup Language over the last 17 years. So I support XML for
certain domains - chemistry, geoscience, and other physical sciences.

But there are very few absolutes in this area.

Other domains such as bioscience rely much more on words and less on
structure. So HTML is a natural way of communicating ideas. It's universal

manage most of what is necessary. The great thing about HTML is that any

ask where you can get a toolchain (yes, it exists and there is a lot of my

Probably true. But some are top down (a political activity) and some are
bottom up (i.e. the discipline has no interest or insight into doing it).
Top down works, often very slowly. Bottom-up often does not work but when it
does moves rapidly.

Each domain will provide different ways of disseminating their data and
metadata.

There is no single one-fits-all solution. For several decades  there are
likley to be per-domain solutins with more-or-less funding, more or less
volunteer activity. In chemistry it's been a very hard strufggle against the
forces of inertia and walled-garden commercialism (who benefit from keeping
the subject in the dark ages).

Thank you, Peter. That helps me put what I know a little about in  
perspective with respect to what I don't know anything about.

I would only argue with you that "where" matters in the study of  
fossils, trees and many other objects of study not generally thought  
of as subjects of the geosciences. Studying such objects very often  
requires managing geospatial information, and so students of those  
Earth features would benefit from leveraging the work that I described  
below.

Curiously, lung science (http://www.technologyreview.com/computing/37387/?nlid=4352&a=f 
) and brain science (http://geo.sdsc.edu/ilya/presentations/INCF_Atlas_Services_and_WaxML_version_06pic.doc 
) require, or will require, standard ways of dealing with spatial data  
that are not too different from the OGC's Earth-referencing geospatial  
standards.

text-mining atmospheric publications. It involves
 * chemistry (we have a tool OSCAR which is very good at that). It turns the
textual chemistry into CML molecules.
 * geo-coordinates. Here we can certainly use help
 * authors, titles, so we use OKF Open Bibliographic approaches (mainly RDF)
 * proper names (survey stations, campaigns, places, etc)
 * physical science (quantities and units - "a velocity of 20 km.hr",
"concentration of 12pptV" "temperature of 25 Celsius"). We use CML for this

For each facet we have to use different tools.

BTW if you have applications where you wish multidiscplinary data extracted
from text then OSCAR is able to do quite a bit (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/04/15/oscar4-launch-roundup/ ). There's
no magic, just hard work fitting the bits together.

And what's the hardest thing?

Being allowed to extract our (i.e. the scientific community) own data from
our own publications without being sued. It's a sad fact that one of the
miain functions of the OKF is to enlighten the world that almost everything
is not open and to encourage them to work towards it.

Not enough people care yet.

Well said Peter! From my own experiences I couldn't agree more. May I steer
this discussion onto a related topic : http://www.isitopendata.org/

I want to encourage data in my community to be explicitly and properly
licenced in an 'as-open-as-possible' way.
To this end, I made my first foray in to IsItOpenData enquiries:
http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/6841b8b2-8fc8-4165-8ac4-6f699a68e3ab/

<http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/6841b8b2-8fc8-4165-8ac4-6f699a68e3ab/>It's
been rather a long time now, and I still have had no reply. What do you
think I should do next? I'm actually going on a PaleoDB training course
later this month. John Alroy himself won't be there but people only slightly
lower down the chain-of-command will...

Any tips?

This is all down to people concerns. Unlike WhatDoTheyKnow? where the organs
have to reply within 20 working days, there is no compulsion in IIOD. A lack
of response gives no indication of anything. It could be:

* I'm really interested in replying but haven't had the time and it's a
hassle
* I didn't read the email
* I am opposed to Open Access, and Open anythingelse because ...
   ... Open anything is junk quality. The ACS, Elsevier and others ran the
PRISM project to discredit Open Access. Many people unfortunately assume
that Open=> junk.
   ... the proponents are unrealistic do-gooders who make life difficult
   ... Open ABCD stops me making money from it
   ... I don't have time to worry about this (next grant, next Nature paper,
etc.)
   ... if I make my data Open then others might use it
* If I don't reply ("mumble") then it makes life harder for the Open data
hippies and buys me time

There's nothing formal that can be done. There's lots of informal stuff like
 * showing the benefits of Open Data
 * working with funders (this is probably the strongest pressure group -
they want data to be Open).
 * trying to collect known supporters together.

There's a strong awareness now of the issue since research funders are
mandating Data management plans. You've seen the friction involved in things
like tree-ring data? It's been decided that the data must be released as
part of FOI. (There are lots of caveats). It's a political judgment as to
whether it's worth creating open confrontation or trying ot get orgs to
change. I am fairly strong publicly but haven't chained myslef to railings
yet. But I can afford to be; I wouldn't urge a young scientist to confront
the system but I would support them completely if they were determined to.

In your case it sounds like talking to as many people in the community as
possible is a good first step. Believe in the absolute mission but make your
own mind up about the day-to-day and year-to-year strategy. It may be that
creating a bottom-up volunteer community of fossil data people and data is
practicable. That's what Steve Coast did for OSM and what we are doing in
bibliography. And what I am doing in crystallography. And hopefully in
compchem.

Energy and commitment are very valuable and in considerable supply!

	information
Message-ID: <75AA6AE0-7B02-4D04-AE55-0D4D42B348D8@ad.unc.edu>

Peter's draft whitepaper on text-mining is badly needed and nicely put.  I was particularly interested in this passage:

"The provision of journal articles is controlled not only by copyright but also (for most scientists) the contracts signed by the institution. These contracts are usually not public. We believe (from anecdotal evidence) that there are clauses forbidding the use of systematic machine crawling of articles, even for legitimate scientific purposes."

We have also heard tell of the existence of such clauses, but also have not been able to secure first-hand evidence for them.  It would be very nice to promote this from "anecdotal" to "documented", and I would like here to put out a wider plea for anyone who might be able to provide the language of these contractual retrictions.  Alternatively, I would welcome suggestions for how we are to know what exactly we are prohibited from doing in light of the confidential nature of the contracts.  

If copyright holders really wish to enforce such restrictions, it seems odd that their very existence is little more than a rumor. Can secret restrictions be legally enforced?

IANAL but I think this depends on the legal jurisdiction. We continually
hear of contracts in many areas of activity vwhere part of the contract is
that details may not be disclosed, so I expect it is legal. However I don't
know whether such gagging clauses are actually in force or whether not many
people are sufficiently interested to tell us.

So there is one legal way to find out and I think it's appropriate. Before
doing it it would be very useful to have more confirmation, as if this is
well known I don't want to waste poeple's time.

So, please, can we have rapid responses to this question before I (amd
possibly others) start stirring things yet again...

Here's an example: http://orpheus-1.ucsd.edu/acq/license/cdlelsevier2004.pdf

(see section 1.2a, GTC 1)

Most of these contracts are indeed confidential, and they are as 
enforceable as contracts ever are.

Secrecy is orthogonal to the question; it's just another term in the 
contract. If the signer of a contract agrees to give up rights, 
including the right to talk about giving up rights, then that's their 
choice. If the signer decides to break contract and publish the details, 
then they lose the rest of the contract, including the right to use the 
copyrighted works in this case. The copyright holder could pursue a 
contracts case and shut off access to the copyrighted works.

I actually would not get worked up about whether or not the contracts 
are secret. Lots of deals are private for lots of reasons, and spending 
cycles on why deals or private or if those deals are good or bad isn't 
worthwhile. Asking simple questions like "did you waive the right to 
index or text mine" is a lot more worthwhile than asking "why isn't the 
deal public" IMHO.

Also note efforts such as Nature's text mining interface 
(http://opentextmining.org/wiki/Main_Page) to use technology to make 
text mining possible without access to the articles themselves, and the 
weakness of using "open" as a metric, because one can provide "open" 
access under many definitions to an article but render it essentially 
impossible to text mine by using PDF inarticulately.

Two quick points on this.

First, basically any of the contracts from state institutions in the 
US are public record and can be obtained under state Freedom of 
Information act laws. In addition, there is a move underway within 
the ARL libraries (both public and private) to stop writing contracts 
with non-disclosure clauses; there's a feeling that greater 
transparency, both in financial terms and in terms of useage 
conditions and restrictions, is desirable. I believe that there was a 
piece in the Chronicle of Higher Education a couple of weeks ago 
discussing a Cornell position statement on this.

But having said this, usually the terms that the publishers are 
trying to keep secret are financial; as you say, if there's a 
prohibition on mass downloading of articles, it's pretty useless if 
people in the institutional community are not aware of it. I would 
suspect that if you contact your university library and ask them 
about contractual restrictions on bulk downloading or crawling, 
they'll be quite forthcoming.

I believe that such clauses are pretty commonplace.  They often deal 
with both crawling and also with downloading "significant" portions 
of the journal article databases onto local faculty or student 
machines.

In that contracts, in addition to copyright,  represent a significant
constraint
on open access, the full exploration of such contractual conventions seems
very useful to our common goal...

Cliff suggests several clear paths to discovery of such contractual terms
and
the compilation of a corpus of such documents would seem a very helpful
community resource...?

The CDL/ Elsevier contract includes [@ "Schedule 1.2(a)
 General Terms and Conditions  "RESTRICTIONS ON USAGE OF THE LICENSED
PRODUCTS/ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS"
GTC1] "Subscriber shall not use spider or web-crawling or other software
programs, routines, robots or other
 mechanized devices to continuously and automatically search and index any
content accessed online under this
 Agreement. "

Message-ID: <BANLkTi=0AQrkvBMuzN977z4+bS8ENo9j4Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

There has been some discussion (forwarded below) regarding the working group
web pages and linking them together to make it easier for a newcomer to
navigate. This has hopefully been improved a little but the naming of our
working group is pretty inconsistent which could cause confusion, what title
would people prefer?

1) OKF Open Data in Science Working Group (original title, still used on the
group wiki http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/science)
2) OKF Open Science Working Group (used on the homepage
http://science.okfn.org/ and consistent with the mailing list address)
3) OKF Science Working Group (consistent with our URLs)

Thoughts and preferences most welcome, and then we can ensure everything is
consistent on the websites (URLs and email address will not change) so its
clear we're the same group!

There is also a suggestion from Robert (below) that we expand the scope of
the group or create another group to look at the open practice of science in
addition to data related issues. Comments welcome!

Jenny

Hi Jenny and Rufus,

Here is a slightly longer reply to your response to my comments.

I've now re-visited the various bits, and note the changes you've made,
Jenny.  It seems to me that it would still be helpful to have a proper
overall design in place.    Something like:

The Open Data in Science home page at (say) http://sciencedata.okfn.org (*
not* science.okfn.org) should be a proper home page, not a blog page with a
rather obscure 'About' link.   I.e. a short bit of introductory text, and a
set of links to:
- the blog postings (i.e. what you currently see on the home page);
- the wiki (saying what it's role is in the group);
- the BuddyPress site (saying what *it's* role is in the group - it's still
not clear to me what it is meant to be used for).

Each of these should have the same group title, suitable qualified (e.g.
'Open Data in Science wiki'), and an obvious link back to the group home
page.

Ideally, there should be a single login for the wiki and BuddyPress - it's
the same community.

Perhaps there could be a wiki page for discussing this?

Given that the interests of your group do relate specifically to data, what
are the prospects of either expanding the scope of the group to include all
aspects of open science, or (better) to establish another group which is
concerned with the facet that particularly interests me, namely the open
practice of science - what seems to be the main focus for the term 'open
research' (at least, according to wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research).   Is that outside the remit of
the Open Knowledge Foundation?


Cheers,
Robert

Yes, I second Rufus, I've tried to fix the things I have access to, but site

Yep, that is an issue, I use them interchangably all the time, depending on
how lazy I'm feeling. We should probably make a decision which one to stick
with. Open Data in Science is the official version.

I can't fix this one

There is a link to the homepage on the second line under 'Participate', but
I've added a more prominent one at the top of the page.

I think this page was set up quite a while ago, it could probably be
deleted.

Links now added to the Wiki, BuddyPress group and major group projects, Wiki
also cross linked to the BuddyPress group. The About page (accessible from
the top toolbar) has now been updated, but needs a bit more work.

It now links to the main group page

Can't help there :)

Thanks for pointing all these put, the linking up of the websites was raised
in a WG meeting last December, but I hadn't got round to looking at them
again so thanks for giving me the impetus!

Hi All

Graham Steel has been working towards getting a banner advertising the
Panton Principles on BioMedCentral. They have been incredibly helpful and we
have a web designer who will assist us, but input would be much appreciated.
The current idea is to have a relatively simple text banner:

Colour scheme suggestion: http://kuler.adobe.com/#themeID/1301474 (somewhat
similar to the WG homepage)
Font: as per Panton Principles website (or close enough)

First frame: Panton Principles for Open Data in Science
Second frame: Tagline, something snappy and ideological ;)
+ button to link to site.

What sums up the Panton Principles in a few words - why are they important?
Anything that could encourage people to click through would be fantastic.

Looking forward to your suggestions :)

Jenny

	(London, December 2011)
Message-ID: <BANLkTik=EH9UM9dnV7oBWb-km1zxhcF4-w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

OKF have been contacted by the organisers of  an international workshop
of Semantic Web Application in Life Sciences to be held in London in
December (last year's programme http://www.swat4ls.org/2010/progr.php )

They are interested in holding a open data related satellite event, like an
hackathon or clinics on exporting and integrating open scientific data, or
an evening discussion on open data in science.

Would anyone be keen to help organise something? Let me know by the end of
the week and we can get back to them with some ideas, or at least an
expression of interest!

Thanks very much!

Jenny

Many thanks Graham, Jenny and BMC

I am about to have a bath after a day's walk in the April sunshine and see
what comes to mind. The fundamental themes include:
* open data means better science
* open data brings science to everyone
* machines and humans can work together
* open data means reproducible believable science

Having run two weekend hackathons I would be happy to try to provide
inspiration - i'm not the best person to look for venues, organisation, etc.

I prefer events which have some goal even if this changes during the session
.

Open Science. The latter is a broad church which can include doing science
in the Open (i.e.  publishing everything directly to the web), making
materials and methods Open, breaking closed monopolies, etc. Open Data in
Science is a subset which requires only that the data (in its widest sense)
be made open at the time of "publication". I am a supporter of Open Science
, but I can conceive that there are many who are or can be convinced of Open
Data but who would never espouse Open Science .

I like this term most, as it does not preset an agenda. Instead, it
leaves room for the WG to decide what to tackle.

I think this is a very good idea! Our exercise on the
IsItOpenData(LODD) (I'll try to catch up next week!) shows the Open
nature of data in the LOD network is not well-defined, and that there
is a lot of confusion.

I will not be able to attend this meeting, nor available for
organization, but quite interested otherwise!

+1

I can contribute logistical support, advice, and suchlike remotely if
WG members think this is worth pursuing.

FWIW I'd most like to see some kind of hands on workshop where
participants work towards some tangible, useful output! ;-)

Peter: think we should do an open data in science hackday? Is there
anything which you think we could/should make? (Not just code - e.g.
could do a nice printable open data in science 'propaganda kit' with
stickers, leaflets, short video, etc...)

All: perhaps we could put suggestions for things to build on
ideas.okfn.org tagged 'science'.

I think that Open Research Reports (Open Research Maps) would be an ideal
target. I think I have mentioned this before, but it's an idea that takes
Open articles from PMC, organizes them by disease and creates a resource
(which we believe will be better than anything currently available). The
idea has variously included DavidS, Leslie, Cameron, Ben,, Graham etc. We
see this as a figurative and literal map of resach in these areas including
timelines, geolocation, citation links, etc.This could really hep the effort
take off.

It could do a huge amount for those who cannot read the current literature
because of the policy of pricing  everyone except those in rich Western
universities out of the market. There will be a lot of value for disease
groups, third-world etc.

We probably need fresh impetus and maybe a volunteer who puts this at the
top of their list

Brilliant. Are there others on this list who'd be interested in
participating or helping to organise a workshop on open data in
science in London in December?

Excellent. I think we need to both plan this and also to start a lot of
public momentum. We've certainly got time. Maybe we need a summer meeting to
get a prototype working and to iron out the bugs.

I think we can safely get back to them with a yes then! I'm more than happy
to help organise on the logistics/publicity side of things.

What do people think of having an evening talk following the hackday, to
present what people have been working on and entice those who don't have
time for a full workshop? When Lucy Chambers originally forwarded the
request she said there had been a suggestion of asking Ben Goldacre to
speak. I think disease mapping and advocacy of open data would be right up
his street (I spotted him in the audience at OKCon a couple of years ago
too, so he knows who we are).

Hi All

Sorry, this is a little after the conversation has occured but I'm helping
Peter draft the text mining paper so I spent some time over the Easter
weekend looking up a few license agreements where they were available, in
order to turn our 'anecdotal evidence' into real exampes. There are quite a
lot of license agreements on the web (obviously without the contractual
details such as subscription fee, but that's not important for us). Some are
posted on the publishers site, others by institutions (well done, the Max
Plank Digital Library http://www.mpdl.mpg.de/services/ezb-readme_en.htm)

Anyhow, here is my very non-systematic collection of 10 license agreements
from some some of the larger academic publishers, including the CDL/Elsevier
one already mentioned (there are actually 11 entries, but 2 are the same
agreement).
https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AtV3tIqIu0UZdGVMNTAtejhBUlFySGk4QWdrVHJNdkE&hl=en&authkey=CKC-_LQP

3 don't mention data/text mining (which isn't to say there isn't an
additional clause in other versions of the agreement)
6 explicity forbid it via various means
1 probably forbids it but isn't quite so explicit.

There are lots more out there, but this is a start at least.

Jenny - this is really great - just the sort of thing we need. Have you got
the references for the documents from the BL and NaCTeM - they are very
compelling for change of copyright.

I am still waiting to hear from Elsevier about my request to text mine their
stuff...

As a slight aside Lessig's talk at CERN (at least the first half) shows the
immorality (he uses that word) of publishers controlling access for profit.

It will certainly work, if we prepare the ground. Ben has explored the
malaria open papers and I think this is a very good starting point for
several different reasons...
* it's feasible, there's a critical mass of information available. The term
"malaria" is much more precise than some other medical terms so
preision/recall is good
* it's a global challenge and inclusive. We could do some really valuable
OSM stuff
* everyone has heard of it
* there's a chance that it could link up to other funded efforts (e.g. Mat
Todd's Open Drug initiative)

To prepare we need to get a critical group of us physically together and
prepare some working material. Ben's stuff is a really good start and should
act to bring people in for later hackfests. For the main event we already
need an infrastructure that people can add to - hackfests are not always
good at creating a viable infrastructure. We need something with the feel of
OSM mapping parties where the vision has been implemented in part and
volunteers can easily add to it.

yes, great, thanks,

just wondering if authors should really call such licences "agreements" if actually they are... well... coercive. 
in my understanding, anything that comes in a "take it or leave it" mode should not be called an "agreement", at least not by the user side ;-)

I should think we had better drop "agreement" an call such a brilliant overview

"Publisher licenses"

- more to the point, I guess, unless users really start working for what might properly be called an agreement (people taking different positions talk to one another, discuss, negotiate and then possibly reach a jointly agreed solution).

anyway, seems like we might me getting there one of these days,
keep up the good work :-)

cheers,
Claudia

Formally they are legal contracts and have the force of contract law in the
jurisdiction that they are signed in. I agree they are coercive but only
because (a) there is a pseudo-monopoly - theye is no alternative supplier
for a Nature article and (b) universities are totally spineless and
presumably agree to the conditions they are presented with (they haggle over
price - a bit - and have no concern for how  the rights are given away).

So maybe this will get the message through - we have to keep trying - and I
think a snappy presentation here could help.
