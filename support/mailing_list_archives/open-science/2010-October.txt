Congrats to Cameron, Timo and others for their involvement in this
exhibition at the BL!

Was pleasantly surprised to see them and other familiar faces in the
exhibition as I was passing through the British Library yesterday! ;-)

News release
14 October 2010

Growing Knowledge exhibition benefits UK researchers

Researchers' interactions in a new digital environment launched today
at the British Library are set to help JISC and similar organisations
lead the future of research.

<http://www.bl.uk/growingknowledge>

The way that people interact with never-seen-before tools,
thought-provoking content and futuristic design in the new 'Growing
Knowledge: the evolution of research' exhibition will provide clues to
how research is changing and what researchers want to experience from
the library of the future.

Created to encourage engagement and debate, researchers will be able
to physically interact with tools such as Sony?s 360-degree
Autostereoscopic Display, a Microsoft Surface Table and HP/Haworth
interactive pods as well as view all the content and tools online.

Working with JISC and the Ciber Research Group, part of UCL, library
users and exhibition visitors will be invited to leave their feedback
with discussion groups for postgraduate students to explore some of
the issues in more depth, for example: How do physical spaces support
digital research? Do any of the tools help with some of the issues
they encounter?

Sarah Porter, head of innovation at JISC, said: ?Part of JISC?s
approach to technology for education is to consult with researchers
and other library users so that we can channel our energy and
investments into areas that are really going to make a difference.
When we help with the evaluation of this exhibition we will be looking
to understand further the place of digital tools in libraries for the
benefit of teachers, students and researchers. ? It?s an opportunity
to explore how innovative technologies can support people finding
resources in virtual spaces as well as the physical library.?

Richard Boulderstone, the British Library?s director of e-strategy and
information systems, said: ?Over the last year we have been speaking
to teams of researchers across the UK and around the world, getting a
taste of how research is changing. ?We?ve met with researchers from
archaeologists and performance historians to bioinformaticists, who
are using the power of technology and the web to generate more
collaborative and intuitive research models."

Growing Knowledge will explore some of these disciplines as well as
others, allowing visitors to interrogate, both physically and online
these areas and listen to explanatory videos from experts, who will
also reflect on how research is changing, and how it may in the
future.

Richard continued: ?We hope Growing Knowledge will inspire and
intrigue in equal measure. For the British Library, it gives us an
opportunity to define the role we will play in this brave new world.
Growing Knowledge is also an exciting collaboration with a range of
our partners. ?The Library works closely with many partners to help
fill gaps in our knowledge and this exhibition provides an opportunity
to work together to understand how researchers will use these tools in
the future.?

The exhibition was today formally opened by Andrew Miller MP, chair of
the science and technology committee, exhibition researcher in
residence Dr Aleks Krotoski and British Library chief executive, Dame
Lynne Brindley. ?Growing Knowledge runs until 16 July 2011.

In partnership with BBC, one part of the Growing Knowledge exhibition
will explore whether social media tools and online networking support
researchers in their work. ?Please contribute to the debate through a
short survey at
<http://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/growingknowledge/>

I just ran into this email while cleaning up my inbox... I was
wondering about the status of this effort... was there much response?
did you write up a summary?

Hi Egon,

We did indeed get a response from PLoS and BMC.  Haven't heard from Nature.
 Also, in response to a slightly different email about open API data,
Mendeley clarified their open data policies.

The summary of the PLoS and BMC response is on the new OKFN science blog:
http://science.okfn.org/2010/09/13/bmc-and-plos-all-the-data-is-cc-by-enjoy/

I have plans to do a quick writeup of the Mendeley response and also a "tips
for IsItOpenData enquiries" post to summarize what I learned about avoiding
spam filters etc.  I'll finish those Real Soon Now.

Alas I don't have time at this point to send the letter out to other
publishers, though others are certainly welcome to!  Let me know if I can be
of help.  Anita de Waard had useful suggestions about making the definition
of metadata looser before we send it out to commercial publishers.  The most
recent version of the letter on etherpad incorporates this feedback:
http://okfnpad.org/isitopenLetters

Cheers,
Heather

PLoS and BMC were the only publishers that received a letter so far?

I have a good feeling of what ACS, RSC, etc, will reply...

Hi Egon,

PLoS, BMC, and Nature received the letter.  We got rapid human confirmation
that the letter was "receiving attention" at Nature but haven't heard since
then.

> I have a good feeling of what ACS, RSC, etc, will reply...

Agreed.  I think it is ready to go... just needs to be sent (and, in my
experience, followed up with a short email composed with few links and no
spam language, sent from a personal email account, alerting the publisher
that they have been sent such a letter, it may be in their spam folder, and
highlighting that their response will immediately be made public).

And for completeness in case there is a volunteer lurking on the list, I'll
mention that then there is a round of reminders and thank yous at the end.

Anyone, feel free to contact me if you want to send a few and have
questions.

Heather

The 37th International Association for Social Science Information
Services and Technology (IASSIST) annual conference will be hosted by
Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia and will be
held in Vancouver, Canada, May 31 ? June 3, 2011.

The theme of this year's conference is Data Science Professionals: a
Global Community of Sharing. Social science benefits from professional
practices that enable sharing of data, information, and knowledge with
a global community. This theme is intended to stimulate discussions
about ways in which sharing data, information, and knowledge can
contribute to research and to professional practices that enable
scientific progress. Submissions are encouraged that offer
improvements for creating, documenting, submitting, describing,
disseminating, and preserving scientific research data.

Workshops details:

The conference committee seeks workshops that highlight this year?s
theme ?Data Science Professionals: a Global Community of Sharing?.
Below is a sample of possible workshop topics that may be considered:

? Statistical Literacy

within and across disciplines
? Citation of research data and persistent identifiers
? Metadata facilitating data sharing
? Emerging research infrastructures and data sharing
? New data partnerships in knowledge communities
? Sharing resources and data through social networks
? Identifying user needs and customizing data services to meet the needs
? The evolving data librarian profession
? Data science practices that support global use and understanding of
research data
? Open (linked) data and digital repositories
? Preservation for sharing, recovering data for contemporary use

Successful workshop proposals will blend lecture and hands-on
instruction. The conference planning committee will provide the
