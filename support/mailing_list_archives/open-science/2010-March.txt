This looks interesting!


---------- Forwarded message ----------
For a study on the costs associated with Supplementary Data in
academic or scientific journals, I'd be interested in hearing from any
journal or publisher willing to participate in a short interview.
We're interested in learning about the costs, expenses, or changing
time allocations related to the maintenance of Supplementary Data,
whether these are editorial or production processes, ?direct costs, or
other consequences.
All replies will be kept confidential and results will be aggregated
with an ongoing project on data archiving. ?Thank you.

I would require some hacking I think. I'm afraid I won't have time for
that until at least the end of March. Instead of things getting
quieter, it just keeps building up... where is that tenure when you
need it... ?? ;)

Could the source PSD, AI, or SVG files be posted? Then anyone can
generate various sizes without quality loss.

As a temporary hack, we can import the endorsement page HTML into a
Google spreadsheet:
https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuD5dr31WtX4dG1yR3FUSzhtOHB3elpSOU1lY2N2WkE&hl=en

There, the number of signatures is totaled, and should update every 15
minutes. The results can be published as HTML, and embedded in an
Iframe for inclusion in other sites:
http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=tmrGqTK8m8pwzZR9MeccvZA&single=true&gid=9&range=totalsignatures&output=html

According to this, the Principles have reached 100 endorsements!

Message-ID: <67fd68331003090808vb79b423q23353eaee2a787a@mail.gmail.com>

I presented the Panton Principles briefly to UKPubMedCentral (UKPMC) of
which I am a member of the advisory board. I'm not attributing anything but
there was general positive interest.

One question I was asked related to how the principles enforced attribution
and it made me think that we should have a set of FAQs answering questions
like:
"Do I need to include a license with my data?"
"how does the public domain enforce attribution"
...

I would certainly find this useful. Given my occasionally sketchy and
incorrect answers I would limit mysslef to the questions!

We are talking to a variety of editors and publishers who are keen to make
data "open available" and in many cases mandate it as part of the scientific
process. It's clear that although PP are (I hope) fairly self-explanatory
the implications (licences, buttons, "public domain", community norms, etc.)
are unclear and need careful explanation. One way to do this is through FAQs
and we (Rufus, Cameron, Jonathan + me) are asking for the help of the
OpenScience list to provide useful communal answers. I'll post the FAQs -
feel welcome to add to them but not TOO many - and ask you to create
answers. There is a pirate pad at:

http://piratepad.net/LgLRcGLw35

Please use to edit, discuss, hack etc.

We will appreciate rapid feedback as we hope to promote this to attendees at
the AmerChemicalSoc (ACS) next week.

Great work Mike. I've gone through and added some more and done some
tidying up. We've almost got full coverage now (just a couple of TODOs
in there) though I'm sure over time we can much expand on some of
those answers.

I've attempted the somewhat tricky Q8 regarding community norms, as it
looked invitingly blank. Hopefully, if I have completely missed the point,
it may encourage someone to rectify it due to the xkcd effect:

I like the wording very much.

Thanks to everyone - I can show this to an editorial board this morning.

Wonder if there's any scope here for a radio show on open science?

Radio Shows to Communicate Key Themes of the JISC e-Learning Programme
To: JISC-ANNOUNCE at jiscmail.ac.uk


***Apologies for Cross Posting***

The JISC invites proposals to organise and produce a series of
internet radio shows to communicate key themes of the JISC e-Learning
Programme. These shows will be aimed at senior managers and
practitioners working in UK further and higher education.

It is expected that a total of 10 shows would be broadcasted over a
two year period, focusing on topics which are of relevance to senior
managers working in further and higher education, and draw together
outcomes from the e-Learning Programme which can assist senior
managers in addressing these issues.

Total funding of up to ?50,000 (including VAT, travel and subsistence)
is available for this work.

The deadline for proposals is 12.00 noon UK time on Tuesday 11th May 2010.

It is envisaged that bidders will be notified of the outcome of the
evaluation process in the week commencing 24th May 2010.

The successful bidder will be expected to start work by 1st June 2010.

The final show will be due to have been completed by 1st June 2012,
with a short final report describing the processes involved in
producing the shows and any recommendations for future e-Learning
Programme radio shows being provided by 31st July 2012.

A full version of the ITT can be found here.

Great idea.

Indeed. Seems a perfect fit. Also branching out into international
case studies, examples of the benefits of data sharing, etc would make
for richer listening. Anyone know anyone with radio production
experience who might be interested in this?

As I read the call, they want someone to produce 10 shows on their agenda. I
don't see how this fits.

Actually, I happen to have radio production experience: I produced (and presented) a weekly 2 hour show for Future Radio in Norfolk for 2 years before becoming itinerant and sending them podcast versions for a short while after that. I can advise on bit rate, and also know how to do all the recording blah: equipment is pretty cheap nowadays with very good quality recording capacity, roundabout the 500GBP mark would get a pretty near top of the range portable recording device which would be able to produce both broadcast quality as well as the lower bit rate for podcast/streams...

Jonathan et. al.
I happen to have Adrian Stevenson (copied) on my team at UKOLN - Adrian has radio production experience and a professional interest in open/linked data.

I'd like to put a 'marker of interest' down at this stage - I will need to check the details of the JISC ITT, but this does look like an opportunity which fits UKOLN's remit, strategic interests and resources.

Quite right Yishay! I interpreted this as a call for shows/series of
shows such that we could propose something on open data in science,
but looks like its pretty focused on finding someone to produce a much
broader series on e-Learning. My mistake - wishful reading!

Perhaps we should nevertheless try and do a series of podcasts on open
data in science on our own steam (a la Panton discussions)?

All the best,

Jonathan

P.S. Apologies for brevity - I've injured my hand so typing is slower
than usual!

Dear all,

Writing from a publisher that is keen to make data available, I'd like
to point out two sets of guidance relevant to some matters arising from
the pirate pad discussions on the Panton Principles.

Firstly, the issue of protecting privacy in human subject research. This
is a major barrier to the sharing of clinical information and I wonder
if it is being glossed over in the FAQ (13). Some practical guidance on
openly sharing clinical data was published in the BMJ earlier this year,
for example:
http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/jan28_1/c181

Secondly, applying PP prior to publication. At BioMed Central, for
example, we encourage openly sharing data before formal publication [in
a peer-reviewed journal] and encourage editors to not preclude open
projects from publication. 
http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/duplicatepublication
So perhaps PP should be applied more uniformly, without the need to
clarify what 'publication' is.

Best regards,

Iain

We are talking to a variety of editors and publishers who are keen to
make
data "open available" and in many cases mandate it as part of the
scientific
process. It's clear that although PP are (I hope) fairly
self-explanatory
the implications (licences, buttons, "public domain", community norms,
etc.)
are unclear and need careful explanation. One way to do this is through
FAQs
and we (Rufus, Cameron, Jonathan + me) are asking for the help of the
OpenScience list to provide useful communal answers. I'll post the FAQs
-
feel welcome to add to them but not TOO many - and ask you to create
answers. There is a pirate pad at:

http://piratepad.net/LgLRcGLw35

Please use to edit, discuss, hack etc.

We will appreciate rapid feedback as we hope to promote this to
attendees at
the AmerChemicalSoc (ACS) next week.

Dear Iain,

on the first point, what do you think of the current phrasing
"Respecting the privacy of research subjects should be an integral
part of the decision whether to make the data Open."?

With kind regards,

Daniel

Dear Daniel,

Thanks -- I like the tone of the revised version. I am guessing discussion of the alternatives to fully open data, in cases where privacy cannot be protected, is beyond the scope of these FAQs (in which case no further information is needed)?

Best regards,

Iain

Dear Iain,

on the first point, what do you think of the current phrasing
"Respecting the privacy of research subjects should be an integral
part of the decision whether to make the data Open."?

With kind regards,

Daniel

The original idea behind the Panton Principles was that we sidestep this
issue. The key point being that where there are privacy issues (or other
issues) you simply do not choose to publish the data. The PP are not, at
least as far as the bullet points are concerned, to dictate when, how, or if
data are published.

The PP are intended to be applied after the decision has been taken to
publish the data. And by "publish" we meant to be extremely general - hence
the addition I made the other day to the FAQ. I think it is important to be
clear on this point because the term "publish" often means something very
different to different people. And for many researchers it explicitly
doesn't include "make available on the web".

Cheers

Cameron

I sent a version of this to Daniel privately, but he noted that perhaps 
it might have gone to the list as well. It ties into Cameron's point 
about avoiding this question entirely in the PP, but also into the 
importance of understanding what "open data" actually means.

Remember that "open" in the sense of the SC protocol, the OKF definition 
and the panton principles is about the *intellectual property* rights 
associated with data - copyrights, database rights - and *contractual 
property* rights associated with data products. Open doesn't mean it's 
free of constraints like privacy, and it also doesn't mean the data are 
actually *useful* - curated, annotated, explained.

Privacy rights are vastly complex and cannot be waived with public 
licenses like intellectual property rights. there is a complex process 
known as "informed consent" that must be achieved before privacy rights 
can be legally waived, and that consent must be vetted through a process 
approved by an institution's IRB (institutional review board). The IRB 
terms govern the movement of data, under application by researchers.

Thus, data can indeed be "open" under the PP but not made available to 
the world, as the PP only touch on the IP aspects of data. Privacy 
rights create a major driver for using the public domain on data 
actually, as the  prevalence of privacy rights on vast swaths of science 
data - be clinical health data or social science research - renders 
those data incompatible with "viral" sharing regimes on data, as many 
viral regimes disallow the addition of content that cannot itself be 
made viral.

When the data is in the PD, it can flow into a clinical or social 
science database, and then be redistributed under the terms that the IRB 
set forward for the original data, as redistribution of data is 
invaluable in these fields, albeit under much tighter restrictions than 
we associate with "open" science.

We're working on standardizing IRB agreements right now at Creative 
Commons, based on our years of experience with the huntingtons, 
parkinsons, alzheimers, and other rare disease communities that deal 
with privacy issues in the clinical space. these are in many ways the 
easy ones, because the diseases involved make informed consent easier to 
get. informed consent for healthy control subjects is going to be the 
harder problem. and in social science the issues may be irresolvable - 
deidentification is so easy these days, and getting easier.

We're also working on standards for publishing data sets in a format 
that is actively "re-useful" and will be publishing a set of 
recommendations tomorrow in conjunction with the PLoS Forum that encode 
the PP as the legal part of a multivariate problem of making online data 
actively reusable.

I would prefer the FAQs not overstate the power of "open" from an IP 
perspective. Data that is online but burdened with privacy, or with poor 
curation and annotation, lacking persistent URIs, and so forth - that 
data meets the principles, but is likely to be of little use to a 
working scientist. We run the risk of overheated expectations if we 
simply say "raw data now" - the reality is far more complex, and we're 
not all Tim BL ):-)

John's comments are important and point up a fundamental issue respecting
making disclosed
data *effective* / *useful.*  Data placed on an electronic billboard next to
the Santa Monica Freeway
are openly available but are virtually useless except by a series of
cumbersome machinations...*
*
At a time when government agencies in the US are being pushed to disclose
data it is essential
that we develop guidelines and standards for making disclosed data directly
useful -- not just "informative"...

The IPCC situation ("Climate-gate") has made all the more clear why the
precise lineages and provenance of data
-- the record of scientific work flow, transformations, combinations and
recombinations -- must be readily available for
review and assessment...

From yishaym at gmail.com  Wed Mar 24 16:00:41 2010
From: yishaym at gmail.com (Yishay Mor)
Date: Wed, 24 Mar 2010 16:00:41 +0000
Subject: [open-science] JISC Grant Funding 1/10: Access to Resources and
	Open Innovation (was: JISC ITT: Organisation and Production
	of a Series of Internet Radio Shows to Communicate Key Themes
	of the JISC e-Learning Programme)
Message-ID: <e5fbfda11003240900k7c161013h5adea3e1403fd7d9@mail.gmail.com>

Perhaps this is better suited:
http://www.jisc.ac.uk/fundingopportunities/funding_calls/2010/02/grant110bce.aspx

The idea:
Produce an open buisness model and supporting open training and advocacy
resources for open scientific knowledge

Many institutions are reluctant to adopt an open knowledge policy for fear
of loosing potential revenue. This is predominantly a result of misleading
media and outdated concepts. To address these issues, we will:
* develop a viable and robust buisiness model for open scientific inovation,
including business plans, legal templates, case studies
* produce open training and advocacy resources to educate and guide
intitutions in applying this model, inluding podcasts, videos, whitepapers,
* run training workshops for managers, researchers and adminstrators.

I won't be able to lead on this, so in the spirit of open knowledge, I'm
offering the idea for whoever would want to take it forward. I will be
interested in collaborating on it if someone else can take the lead.

Dear John, and Tom,

 

I was excited to read your discussions of data standards and look forward to the PLoS article (tomorrow?).

 

BMC Research Notes (http://www.biomedcentral.com/bmcresnotes/) is also very interested in this area and is trying to encourage data-driven publications, data harvesting and re-use; a corollary to which is guidance and best practice for sharing in different science disciplines.

 

Best wishes,

 

Iain

 

PS. I absolutely agree consent for sharing from human subjects, as part of study recruitment, is key to overcoming privacy barriers.

John's comments are important and point up a fundamental issue respecting making disclosed 
data effective / useful.  Data placed on an electronic billboard next to the Santa Monica Freeway
are openly available but are virtually useless except by a series of cumbersome machinations...

At a time when government agencies in the US are being pushed to disclose data it is essential
that we develop guidelines and standards for making disclosed data directly useful -- not just "informative"...

The IPCC situation ("Climate-gate") has made all the more clear why the precise lineages and provenance of data 
-- the record of scientific work flow, transformations, combinations and recombinations -- must be readily available for
review and assessment...

I sent a version of this to Daniel privately, but he noted that perhaps it might have gone to the list as well. It ties into Cameron's point about avoiding this question entirely in the PP, but also into the importance of understanding what "open data" actually means.

Remember that "open" in the sense of the SC protocol, the OKF definition and the panton principles is about the *intellectual property* rights associated with data - copyrights, database rights - and *contractual property* rights associated with data products. Open doesn't mean it's free of constraints like privacy, and it also doesn't mean the data are actually *useful* - curated, annotated, explained.

Privacy rights are vastly complex and cannot be waived with public licenses like intellectual property rights. there is a complex process known as "informed consent" that must be achieved before privacy rights can be legally waived, and that consent must be vetted through a process approved by an institution's IRB (institutional review board). The IRB terms govern the movement of data, under application by researchers.

Thus, data can indeed be "open" under the PP but not made available to the world, as the PP only touch on the IP aspects of data. Privacy rights create a major driver for using the public domain on data actually, as the  prevalence of privacy rights on vast swaths of science data - be clinical health data or social science research - renders those data incompatible with "viral" sharing regimes on data, as many viral regimes disallow the addition of content that cannot itself be made viral.

When the data is in the PD, it can flow into a clinical or social science database, and then be redistributed under the terms that the IRB set forward for the original data, as redistribution of data is invaluable in these fields, albeit under much tighter restrictions than we associate with "open" science.

We're working on standardizing IRB agreements right now at Creative Commons, based on our years of experience with the huntingtons, parkinsons, alzheimers, and other rare disease communities that deal with privacy issues in the clinical space. these are in many ways the easy ones, because the diseases involved make informed consent easier to get. informed consent for healthy control subjects is going to be the harder problem. and in social science the issues may be irresolvable - deidentification is so easy these days, and getting easier.

We're also working on standards for publishing data sets in a format that is actively "re-useful" and will be publishing a set of recommendations tomorrow in conjunction with the PLoS Forum that encode the PP as the legal part of a multivariate problem of making online data actively reusable.

I would prefer the FAQs not overstate the power of "open" from an IP perspective. Data that is online but burdened with privacy, or with poor curation and annotation, lacking persistent URIs, and so forth - that data meets the principles, but is likely to be of little use to a working scientist. We run the risk of overheated expectations if we simply say "raw data now" - the reality is far more complex, and we're not all Tim BL ):-)

The original idea behind the Panton Principles was that we sidestep this
issue. The key point being that where there are privacy issues (or other
issues) you simply do not choose to publish the data. The PP are not, at
least as far as the bullet points are concerned, to dictate when, how, or if
data are published.

The PP are intended to be applied after the decision has been taken to
publish the data. And by "publish" we meant to be extremely general - hence
the addition I made the other day to the FAQ. I think it is important to be
clear on this point because the term "publish" often means something very
different to different people. And for many researchers it explicitly
doesn't include "make available on the web".

Cheers

"Respecting the privacy of research subjects should be an

Dear all,


Writing from a publisher that is keen to make data available, I'd like
to
point out two sets of guidance relevant to some matters arising from
the
pirate pad discussions on the Panton Principles.

Firstly, the issue of
protecting privacy in human subject research. This
is a major barrier to the
sharing of clinical information and I wonder
if it is being glossed over in
the FAQ (13). Some practical guidance on
openly sharing clinical data was
published in the BMJ earlier this year,
for example:

http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/jan28_1/c181

Secondly, applying PP
prior to publication. At BioMed Central, for
example, we encourage openly
sharing data before formal publication [in
a peer-reviewed journal] and
encourage editors to not preclude open
projects from publication.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/duplicatepublication
So perhaps PP
should be applied more uniformly, without the need to
clarify what
'publication' is.

Best regards,

Iain

We are talking to a variety
of editors and publishers who are keen to
make
data "open available" and
in many cases mandate it as part of the
scientific
process. It's clear
that although PP are (I hope) fairly
self-explanatory
the implications
(licences, buttons, "public domain", community norms,
etc.)
are unclear
and need careful explanation. One way to do this is through
FAQs
and we
(Rufus, Cameron, Jonathan + me) are asking for the help of the
OpenScience
list to provide useful communal answers. I'll post the FAQs
-
feel welcome
to add to them but not TOO many - and ask you to create
answers. There is a
pirate pad at:

http://piratepad.net/LgLRcGLw35

Please use to edit,
discuss, hack etc.

We will appreciate rapid feedback as we hope to promote
this to
attendees at
the AmerChemicalSoc (ACS) next week.

Dear Chris,

Thanks for your reply. I think my comment may have been taken out of
context.

I don't mean to suggest we should be using consent as a reason to go
ahead and share identifiable information at will. When we can perturb
data so that its statistical value is retained but individual anonymity
protected, I agree that this is the best approach. But this is not
always possible or appropriate. As anonymity is so hard to achieve with
certainty, when there is a non-negligible risk that individuals might be
identified from published information we must obtain consent for
publication of that data. As well as data protection legislation journal
publishers and editors subscribe to codes of ethics that require consent
for publication of identifiable information, and that only data that are
scientifically relevant are shared (published). So editors should still
make every effort to preserve anonymity (by removing details not
relevant to the science of the article in question) *and* obtain
consent, unless data are anonymous with certainty (very hard to
achieve). The classic example is the medical case report but this has
become increasingly recognised in clinical research in general. The BMJ
now has a policy (informed by the guidelines I referred to earlier in
this thread) whereby any article including 3 or more indirect
identifiers (from a list of 28 potential items), such as age or sex,
must document whether consent for publication/data sharing was obtained.
Data tables in clinical research articles often include this level of
detail.

http://resources.bmj.com/bmj/bmj/authors/types-of-article/research
"We also strongly support the view that researchers should seek informed
consent to data sharing from research participants upfront, at the
recruitment stage. There are good ethical and practical reasons for
doing so. Even if the investigators have no current plans to share raw
data, at some future time data sharing may become the norm. If so,
sharing will be much easier if no one has to try to seek consent
retrospectively.

Consent is particularly important because participants may be
identifiable in a dataset - even an "anonymised" one that does not
contain names or addresses. The combination of three or more indirect
identifiers such as age, sex, and an unusual clinical detail may be
enough for at least the participant, or another interested party, to
recognise themselves.

Therefore, please provide at the end of your manuscript a data sharing
statement such as:

"Data sharing: technical appendix, statistical code, and dataset
available from the corresponding author at <email address or url>.
Participants gave informed consent for data sharing [or ...consent was
not obtained but the presented data are anonymised and risk of
identification is low... or consent was not obtained but the potential
benefits of sharing these data outweigh the potential harms because...]"

Best wishes,

Iain

Iain, I felt rather worried about possible implications of your
statement "consent for sharing from human subjects, as part of study
recruitment, is key to overcoming privacy barriers". Informed consent is
critical to doing any research at all on data from human subjects, but
AFAIK ethics committees would rarely allow open release of identifiable
data on those human subjects. The sole exception I am aware of would be
quotation of qualitative/interview responses, and the appropriate course
seems to be to go back to the subject showing the precise quote in
context and getting a release at that point.

The default position should surely be that prior informed consent is
never sufficient for open publication of identifiable data on human
subjects, so the data cannot be open in a BBB sense. It should be open
in the sense of being subject to scrutiny from a qualified person who
takes on the obligations of privacy. Properly de-identified or
aggregated data could possibly be made open provided steps are taken to
make it non-disclosive, even in combination with arbitrary other data,
although most data custodians want a step involving identification and
agreement to some kind of licence (again incompatible with BBB). I
believe the techniques for de-identification can involve adding noise to
some variables.

In particular this CFA is asking for:
"* Projects enabling open data sharing in science"
.. which seems like a possibly interesting target for some of the work
carried out re: PP and data licensing?

at ISMB  2010 [Call for PAPERS and POSTERS]
To: w3c semweb HCLS <public-semweb-lifesci at w3.org>


ISMB SIG CALL FOR ABSTRACTS AND POSTERS - Deadline April 30

Metagenomics, Metadata and Meta-analysis / Biosharing
A Special Interest Group (SIG) organized by the Genomic Standards
Consortium (http://gensc.org)
at ISMB 2010 on July 9-10, 2010 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA

URL: http://tinyurl.com/m3bio2010

There are now thousands of genomes and metagenomes available for study.
Interest in
improved sampling of diverse environments (e.g. ocean, soil, sediment,
and a range of
hosts) combined with advances in the development and application of
ultra-high
throughput sequence methodologies are set to vastly accelerate the pace
at which new
metagenomes are generated. The M3/Biosharing SIG will explore the latest
concepts, algorithms, tools, informatic pipelines, databases and
standards that are being developed to cope with the analysis of vast
quantities of metagenomic data. It will also seek to facilitate a
broader dialogue among funders, journals, standards developers,
technology developers and researchers on the critical issue of data
sharing within the metagenomics community and beyond through the
inaugural meeting of the BioSharing community (See http://biosharing.org
for a list of participating communities).

Through two days of invited and contributed talks, panel discussions,
and flash talks associated with poster sessions, we aim to highlight
scientific advances in these fields and identify core computational
challenges facing the wider community. We invite you to submit extended
abstracts to be considered as talks or posters for the M3/Biosharing
SIG. The abstracts will be reviewed by the SIG program committee for
suitability and quality. Select abstracts will be published in a special
issue of the open access online journal Standards in Genomic Sciences
(http://standardsingenomics.org/).

Topics include, but are not limited to:

M3
* Metagenome and microbiome studies of biological interest
* Metagenome annotation
* Consistent contextual (meta)data acquisition and storage in metagenomics
* Contextual (meta)data and sequence data correlation studies
* Computational infrastructures for metagenomic data processing
