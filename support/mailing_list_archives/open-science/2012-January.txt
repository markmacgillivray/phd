I have briefly skimmed the Harvard document and I think it's a useful
basis. My suggestion would be to support it and pick out one or two areas
where we feel strongly. I am particularly encouraged by their use of CC-BY
not CC-NC and perhaps we can elaborate on this.

I would also pick Wikipedia as an example of how scientific research gets
widely disseminated. The world in general sees wikipedia as the first place
to go to and clearly research which is visible ("open" is too problematic)
gets included and closed work does not.

Dear all,

 

I'm interested in further developing some specific use cases where open
data (i.e. available under CC0 or equivalent terms) in journal
publications would be useful or lack of open data has been problematic -
to individual scientists/research groups, and perhaps even the original
data publishers. I'm aware of reasonable evidence of societal/economic
benefits for open data (e.g. within :
http://ie-repository.jisc.ac.uk/279/2/JISC_data_sharing_finalreport.pdf;
http://www.jisc.ac.uk/media/documents/publications/keepingresearchdatasa
fe0408.pdf) but more evidence (aside from more citations, in microarray
research), or anecdotes/cases studies in its absence, of benefits to
individuals/groups would be good. 

 

E.g. "I am scientist doing X kind of experiment and being able to reuse
or harvest all types of Y data from Z journal (or publisher) would be
excellent because..."

 

And ideally...

 

"here's why  the current model prohibits or makes this difficult; or
here's an example of where such an approach has been beneficial
previously....

 

I'd like to include some of these use cases as part of a white paper,
currently well under way, on implementation of a variable license
agreement for open access publications enabling CC0 for data (as agreed
at
http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/report_from_the_p
ublishing_open). 

 

If anyone has any suggestions they would be much appreciated - and of
course acknowledged.

 

Best regards,

Obviously several groups are on this right now.
Kitware is also drafting an open letter in response to this
and I'd like to point out that they welcome anyone contributing
in any way.

Here is what I received from Luis Ibanez lately:

"""
At Kitware, we have decided to respond to both RFIs the*"*Open Source 
Way*"*.

We have posted the draft of our responses in the two public documents below:

  * Open Response to RFI on Public Access to Digital Data
    <https://docs.google.com/a/kitware.com/document/d/1vEcWqAz6bwIIR6qQqWZYc8iUBrOpJ9NrvC9HiiQMc2Y/edit?hl=en_US>
  * Open Response to RFI on Public Access to Peer-Reviewed Publications
    <https://docs.google.com/a/kitware.com/document/d/1QA1eGBynqh-yN0bo3_nYzD3d26nEhvuVPMUR2ffi17o/edit?hl=en_US>

and we now invite everyone to join us in refining and extending the 
answers to both RFIs. The documents are open for editing by anyone with 
the link.

Please join us in improving the feedback that we are providing to OSTP, 
or if you are satisfied with the current content of the documents, 
please join us by signing the response at the end of each document. The 
response will be submitted in the name of the signing parties.

This of course, is not intended to preclude nor diminish any other 
initiatives for responding to the RFIs. We just want to make sure that 
we grab this unique opportunity to drive federal policy.


We will close down edits on* January 10th*, to format the final document 
responses and submit them to OSTP by *January 12th*.

Also, watch for an upcoming inSCIght podcast <http://inscight.org/> on 
this topic, open access and federally funded research, which should be 
available sometime this week.


     Happy New Open Access Year !


        Luis

I think Luis and I are also on the list, and would certainly welcome
comments and support in drafting a response. We had an interesting
discussion yesterday about some related issues, which should hopefully
be put out today as a podcast.

Dear Iain,

one area where lack of open data has been problematic is the one that
I had envisaged to specialize in before I found out that the
conservatism and categorizationism of classical non-public grant peer
review are an even more effective blocker in this regard than the lack
of data sharing.

I am talking about applications of Magnetic Resonance techniques
(mainly imaging, but with some spectroscopic components) to
cross-species comparative studies (preferably in vivo) with the
ultimate goal to better understand the evolution of specific traits. I
am calling this EvoMRI, and that's the handle I commonly go under on
the web if my real name is too long or otherwise does not fit.

For example, take a study on comparative MR-based brain morphometry in
primates: Brain scans are regularly performed on a number of primate
species, often even in large numbers per species, but typically just
one or two species per study. This is understandable by considering
that housing primates is an endeavour that requires a lot of effort
and resources, and so is the operation of MR scanners capable of
imaging living adult primates. So there are very few places in the
world where multiple species of primates are located nearby a MRI
center that is both equipped and licensed for non-human scans (as an
aside, there is no MR center in the world that is dedicated to
cross-species studies, and given the costs involved, none is on the
horizon), and ethical considerations prevent transporting (non-human)
primates long distances just to get them an MRI scan (mobile scanners
exist and become better all the time, but so far, they are useless for
the purposes of brain morphometry).

There is only one publicly available dataset that has brains from
multiple primate species scanned according to a common protocol (even
broadening the search to include post-mortem studies does not give
further results), and these scans (of 11 species) have been recorded
(in vivo) well over a decade ago, so do not meet the quality criteria
that underpin more recent brain morphometric algorithms of the kind
required for cross-species studies of brain structure.

Luckily, large multi-centre brain imaging studies (including ADNI that
has repeatedly popped up in data sharing discussions) in humans have
shown that some scanning protocols can be implemented in a way that
cross-scanner variability does not interfere with clinical diagnoses.
If pooling data from multiple scanners is indeed a valid option within
a species, it certainly makes sense for cross-species studies too, and
here's where the sharing of data (and code, btw) come in.

A review ( http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/neuro.11.025.2009 ) thus makes
the point that
"the major barrier to cross-species MR-based brain morphometry is not
the lack of data nor analytical tools but barriers preventing to
combine them. "

Similarly, a poster ( http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npre.2010.4511.2 )
concludes by stating
"In order to succeed, however, computational efforts on comparative
morphometry depend on high-quality imaging data from multiple species
being more widely available."

Yet there is no culture of making such datasets public, and while many
researchers in the area (especially those personally known to each
other) will happily share their data non-publicly, their individual
terms (e.g. requests for co-authorship or for other datasets or tools
or services in return) are not necessarily compatible with each other,
and in general, they also make the sharing of any derivative works
impossible.

In addition to that, some of the major software tools in the area are
free but not open and thus cannot be adapted from their human-centric
focus to cross-species applications. They took multiple person years
to write, so starting from scratch is not necessarily an option.

Beyond primates, I remember a paper that described MRI of seals, but
when I contacted the authors about getting the data, I got an outright
refusal rather than the request simply being ignored, which is more
common.

To sum up, cross-species studies going beyond the typical lab animals
or typical toolkit of evolutionary depend on data and code sharing, so
the lack of that blocks such fields from developing. As mentioned in
the introduction, however, funding is an even more severe blocker.

First, most funding programs are dedicated to a certain topic. For
things like comparative primate brain morphometry that can variously
be tagged into and out of biology, physics, computer science,
neuroscience, imaging and so on, the fit to basically any funding call
(or scope-limited journal, for that matter) will always be
sub-optimal, thus providing such projects with a bad starting
position.

Second, the topic of the funding scheme defines the set of reviewers
and panelists that are to judge such proposals, and they will
invariably cover only part of the scope of such hard-to-categorize
projects, especially those with a methodological focus. The only way
to mitigate these problems, in my view, is to allow interaction
between applicants and reviewers and to make those exchanges public by
default.

Third, even in those lucky cases when such projects do get funded,
they are normally impeded in ways that follow from the themes of the
funding line - if the project sailed through under "primatology", you
won't easily get expenses for number crunching equipment approved, or
if it came in under "computational neuroscience", the budget for
feeding the animals (nut crunching, perhaps?) will likely approach
zero.

Fourth, the normal funding schemes think in terms of hiring a postdoc
or so for about three years, but certain types of problems - the
Polymath project perhaps being the most well-known example,
comparative brain morphometry probably another - do not necessarily
lend themselves to being solved this way, as they typically require
sets of skills that are unlikely to be adequately represented in the
set of people whose participation can be funded by such classical
hiring schemes, especially if working remotely is not an option. Plus,
some of the skills will be needed for a very small part of the
project, and much of the skill set is hard to predict in the funding
proposal anyway.

Sorry for the long post, but you hit one of my major resonances, and
much of my motivation to deal with matters of open data, open source,
public peer review or open science more generally derives from the
issues outlined above.

 Dear All

See below for a message about the NASA International Space Apps Challenge,
forwarded by Elizabeth Walker Sabet from secondmuse. NASA are a Random
Hacks of Kindness partner and there are several European events in the
planning for late April.

Would anyone be interested in helping to host an OKFN run local event or
forming a team? Any expressions of interest or participation by any of the
means mentioned in the notice would be very gratefully received and please
forward to anyone you think may be interested! For example, any contacts in
University physics or astronomy departments who might be interested in
advertising to their colleagues and students.

Let us know :)

Jenny

Dear Colleagues,

Fifty years since Apollo took humanity to the moon, advances in technology
have made images clearer, the information coming back from space richer,
and the world smaller. A frontier of space data has resulted in the
development of new technology that continues to improve life on Earth. The
challenge before us now is to leverage this data and new technology to
create practical applications that benefit humanity.

NASA, in collaboration with organizations such as yours, is launching an
International Space Apps Challenge <http://open.nasa.gov/appschallenge> to
be held in 2012 that will encourage scientists and concerned citizens from
all continents ? and in space ? to create, build, and invent new solutions
in order to address challenges of global importance. Demonstrating its
commitment to the Open Government
Partnership<http://www.opengovpartnership.org/>,
NASA and space agencies around the world are providing a platform for your
organization to join a transformational movement of 'open innovation'
wherein performance is further improved, decision-making better informed,
entrepreneurship advanced and encouraged, and problems more effectively
addressed and solved.
open data ? open source ? open technology
You are poised to join us in the following endeavors:

   - Sponsor a challenge. Identify and define problems that are valuable to
   your organization.  http://open.nasa.gov/appschallenge/ideas/
   - Work on solutions. Join or form a team.
   - Invite subject-matter experts to contribute to participate and attend
   the event, like software developers, engineers, designers and technologists.
   - Plan a local event. Promote to local and regional experts,

We look forward to working with you to create a better future!

Message-ID: <CABPM+woa66A9WvBA6ieR+CONqxh0qo7NxK0ZSEFvm691UcT2vA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Open data and open science have been the topic of several major
consultation by the European Commission, Royal Society and US Office of
Science and Technology in recent months. Submissions for the latter are
still open and we encourage as many people as possible to contribute or
support existing responses, which are listed in this working group blog
post from Mark MacGillivray
http://science.okfn.org/2012/01/06/ostp-rfi-access-scholarly-publications-data/

So, 2012 is shaping up to be a year where these issues are high on the
agenda and it would be great to find out what members of the working group
would like to see over the next 12 months. We're looking for an open
science wish list, preferably short term goals that can be made into
working group projects but don't let that constrain your imagination!

Responses to this email will be collated into a blog post and discussed at
the next working group meeting and hopefully we'll generate a plan to make
at least a few of them a reality by 2013.

Looking forward to hearing your ideas! I'll kick off with a couple:
* Open slide deck for open data in science presentations.
* Local open science groups in at least 5 new places

Dear All

Happy New Year! It's been a while since we had a working group Skype
meeting and as ever there have been lots of developments and projects in
open data in science and open science more widely to discuss, so I hope
many of you will be able to attend!

Top of the agenda will be what changes we want to see in 2012 and
suggestions for projects and resources to make those happen.

When: Wednesday 25 January at 17:30 UTC/GMT
Location: Etherpad http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-25Jan2012 and Skype (add
your Skype ID to the Etherpad and I'll bring you into the conference call)

Please add your name and Skype ID to the list of attendees on

All,

The most important thing for me this coming year is to see an increase in
the number of open science projects - that is to say labs sharing
experimental data and coordinating science to allow contributions from
anyone. More lab books on the web.

I'd also like to see changes to the way we write papers. I'd like to be
involved in the construction of a paper in the open which has a diverse set
of authors. So something that is refined online, then submitted for
publication and accepted. Obviously this is how we're doing our open
research projects, but I'd like to see the *writing* done this way too. And
I'd like to see the paper be of a very high quality (actually well-written)
in a big journal.

(I'm hoping to try this out with a review in the next month or so.)

This would allow us to trial currencies of authorship/reviewership as
possible replacements to the peer review system we currently use. i.e.
rather than discussing possible replacements we trial a few.

More thoughts on this here:

Any input still welcome.

Haven't had time to draft anything for the data RFI other than a few
edits in the Kiteware doc. Anyone know of any other public response to
that one?

Thanks and cheers,

Daniel

Dear all,

 

As part of a special project ongoing at BMC, I'm looking for a "medium
size" dataset, biological or medical, that could potentially be
published, along with a Data Note (data paper) describing it, in BMC
Research Notes. I recognize "medium" is a loose term. What I mean by
this a dataset too large for additional files (up to 20Mb per file can
be published at BMC), but small enough to be down/up-loadable easily via
standard internet connections; so 50-100Mb ideally.

 

If anyone has any suggestions please send me a personal email back.

 

Kind regards,

 

Iain

Dear all,

I would like to draw your attention to the current Apps4Climate
competition announced by the World Bank and ask you whether you would
consider joining the Open Economics/Open Energy group in preparing a
submission. Here is a short summary of the most relevant competition
rules:

- Each Software Application must be related to climate change, either
to raise awareness, measure progress, or to help in some way to
address the development challenges of climate change.
- Each Software Application must make use of one or more of the
datasets listed in the World Bank Data Catalog (data.worldbank.org) or
Climate Change Knowledge Portal
(http://sdwebx.worldbank.org/climateportal/).
- Submissions may be any kind of software application, be it for the
web, a personal computer, a mobile handheld device, console, SMS, or
any software platform broadly available to the public.
- The Competition Period ends on March 16, 2012 at 5:00 PM EST.

Here are some ideas that are worth investigating:
- We could do an app, which visualises different energy indicators for
all countries from the World Bank database, as in
http://energy.publicdata.eu/.
- We could also use geo-spatial data on deforestation and build a
world map, which tracks changes in forest area and land use as well as
carbon dioxide emissions. There has been a project by the European
Commission just for forest area change and just for Europe:
http://efdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/viewer/. I am not aware of a project for
an app, which includes the whole world.

Is there anyone else working on this? If there are enough human
resources we could even prepare two submissions.

Looking forward to hear from you,

Velichka Dimitrova
Open Economics/Open Energy Working Group

SPARC honors Michael Nielsen as innovator for bringing Open Science into
the mainstream

Washington, DC ? Michael Nielsen, a 37-year-old, Australian quantum
physicist, just completed a 17-city tour in seven countries, doing a series
of presentations to promote the open sharing of data and research to
advance science. On top of that, he spent a month traveling to promote his
book, Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science (Princeton
University Press, 2011). His talk of changing the culture of science has
drawn audiences beyond typical academics. Nielsen?s passion, credibility as
a scientist, and knack for storytelling has helped propel the issue of Open
Science into the mainstream.

For being a thought leader and demonstrating how doing science in the open
can promote change and bringing the discussion to a new level, SPARC honors
Nielsen as the January 2012 SPARC Innovator.

?Michael is an incredibly bright scientist and researcher in this own
right,? said Heather Joseph, executive director of SPARC. ?But he also has
a view beyond 30,000 feet of the entire scientific enterprise, and the
value that open brings to the table.?  His efforts have helped the average
citizen begin to think about Open Science and how to push the issue
forward, she said.

Reinventing Discovery was named as one of the top books of 2011 in the
Financial Times. It was reviewed widely, including mention in The Wall
Street Journal, Nature, and the New York Journal of Books. The book was
named as one of the top books of 2011 in the Financial Times and one of the
best science books of the year by the Boston Globe.

To read the full profile of Michael Nielsen, SPARC?s January 2012 SPARC
Innovator, visit http://www.arl.org/sparc/innovator.

The SPARC Innovator program recognizes advances in scholarly communication
propelled by an individual, institution, or group. Typically, these
advances exemplify SPARC principles by challenging the status quo in
scholarly communication for the benefit of researchers, libraries,
universities, and the public. SPARC Innovators are featured on the SPARC
Web site semi-annually and have included Ventura Perez, PLoS One, Mike
Rossner, executive director of the Rockefeller University Press (RUP) in
New York; The Optical Society of America, R. Preston McAfee of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena; Harvard University FAS;
student leaders; Ted and Carl Bergstrom; Melissa Hagemann of the Open
Society Institute; the University of California; and Herbert Van de Sompel
of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. SPARC Innovators are selected by the
SPARC staff in consultation with the SPARC Steering Committee.

Subject: [open-science] Moving forward with Open Research Reports
Message-ID: <CABPM+wry4JCLp2B9w0F6b_gQYXKK3WS=BL1G6H=iSexHmet1EA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

After a succesful hackathon in December (more here
http://science.okfn.org/2011/10/29/okfn-at-oss2011-open-research-reports/and
here
http://wiki.okfn.org/Working_Groups/Science/swat4ls_hackathon/ORR) we're
looking to move forward with the Open Research Reports project to create a
resource for disease information using open bibliographic metadata and
semantic technologies.

We are looking at a project that can be usefully done with the UKPMC Open
subset and taking the following diseases as a starting point:
- Cancer (Leiomyosarcoma [*LMS*])
- CJD
- Malaria

The tasks that were completed at the hackathon included:

   - List of publications relating to LMS from ACOR [Gilles Frydman]
   - Integrate MIIDI output with open metadata [Mark MacGillivray and Tanya
   Gray]
   - Plan visualisations/UI for ORRs [Jenny Molloy and Graham Steel]

Peter and Mark are curently hacking for Open Biblio and will take a
snapshot of malaria publications in Open UKPMC, put that into Open Bib and
build a Bibserver so we have a solid reference collection to work from.
David Shotton and Tanya Grey are continuing work on the Minimal Information
standard for reporting an Infectious Disease Investigation to create useful
and machine readable summaries of closed disease research.

So how can you get involved?
- Reply to this email to suggest what features you would find useful in an
online resource for open disease research e.g. specific search functions
- Offer help with the technical development of the project
- Offer to advise on the needs of certain user communities e.g.
researchers, patient groups
- Offer to host a meeting or hackathon

For those that can make it, we'll be discussing more at the working group

ORR is based on collections of Open information resources, mainly journal
articles but also data sets, image libraries, software, etc. Each ORR is
standalone but interconnected with all the others and wider Open resources.
In the first instance we see the articles being provided by PubMed
(UK/PMC). We started this in Openbiblio1 where Ben O'Steen created a
Bibserver of the UK/PMC Open subset. Ben - if you're reading - can you let
us know where it is? (Although a machine could be serving several different
resources we'll refer to each as a Bibserver). BibSoup is fuzzily made up
of various Bibservers.

Bibserver has a search/display tool where these resources can be searched
and browsed by facets. It will display any facet in the BibJSON - it
doesn't have to be in the BibJSON vocabulary. Bibservers can ingest a
reasonable range of bibliographic collections - BibTeX, RIS, etc.
Openbiblio2 is working on a BibJSON editor which will be available RSN.

The philosophy of BibSoup is get it out there Openly. Worry about
normalization and disambiguation later.

**Bibliographies have errors** - we must get used to it

(Science has errors as well)

We are not creating the "one true bibliography" we are creating a BibSoup
of bibliographies that are good enough for a local purpose. These local
purposes include:
 * Tom Olijhoek and Malaria
 * Gilles Frydman and Sarcoma

The important thing is that:
* there is a champion for the area. Someone or some group that needs
bibliography and will work to add value for their purpose.
* It is done as fast as reasonable. It's more important that we get the
data out there and show the value of the concept than that it is perfect.
Wiki-like resources can be cleaned quickly later if there is communal will.

My guess is that using Bibserver will largely prevent automated SPAM. It
won't prevent human vandalism but I think that will be low (people will
have to edit the BibJSON somehow and it's a very small payback for
spammers).

Hi all,

I have talked to the people behind MalariaWorld.org and they are interested
in cooperation on the ORR project for malaria.
This means that they could send the weekly list of malaria related papers
that is distributed to all subscribers of the site (>7000 malaria
researchers).
This then could serve as a source for malaria info replacing the UKPMC

Not replacing!!

I see Openbiblio/ORR working very closely with UKPMC (I am on the board) -
an obvious thing is to get the Bibservers mounted there. And it's a stable
platform for the future. It's a way of ORR-generated ideas being fed back
into the wider community.

Subject: [open-science] BibSoup for Open Science
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Oqiaj8hw0A4UXz546ir=jRb35LSsi8WTMvLFUo7Kb5pg@mail.gmail.com>

I am very impressed with the BibSoup/Bibserver software that the Openbiblo
group have come up with and believe it's an important tool for Open Science.
I have written two blog posts
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/22/bibsoup-a-new-open-approach-to-managing-personal-and-group-bibliographies/-
includes videos of the team and an animal explanation of BibSoup
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/23/bibsoup-it%E2%80%99s-here-how-to-create-and-populate-your-own-bibserver/-
a howto for Bibserver

We have a new concept here - I have tried to explain that in the first
post. It differs from everything else in that it is deliberately
decentralised - anyone can do anything. We do not have the idea of the one
true central bibliography, carefully curated to remove all warts and
blemishes. This is an illusion.

Instead we have local bibliographies. They can be local to:

   - a person
   - a group (this is a real opportunity for us)
   - a department (again a real opportunity)
   - a report (e.g. 7000 citations in IPCC report)
   - a slice across the bibliosphere - an Open journal (e.g. Acta Cryst E),
   a publisher (BioMedCentral or PLoSOne), an abstracter/indexer
   (UK/PubmedCentral), etc. Perhaps filtered by Open rights.
   - current awareness - daily filtering of certain journals or other
   outputs.

We then have the really exciting prospect of thousands, or more, local
collections. The linkage between those will be very interesting - a real
opportunity for bibliographic scholarship. We also have the ability to
extend the Bibserver facets to things like:

   - rights - is it open?
   - links to non-conventional objects. Software, datasets, etc.
   - annotations
   - extraction of material from the resource (text and data mining - where
   allowed)

It would be useful to know of Open-science-ists who have collections of
resources where bibliography may help to tie them together and present them
to the world. I may revisit Crystallography and create an Open Bibliography
for crystal structures. It obviously maps directly into Open Research
Reports.

	seeks programmers
Message-ID: <CABPM+wpH4kdUcROzohoS-nmWiaXnxS7gO6JwN_L5hOGKPZ0Wag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Jus to advertise a project getting started at the University of Oxford. The
aim is to build a global platform for scientific knowledge based on article
bibliographic data with automatic retrieval of related material such as
blog posts, post peer review comments, datasets and more accessed via a
simple to use web interface.

The project is advertising for volunteers to assist with programming,
please see the advert below and get in touch with Simon Benjamin if you'd
like more information:

SEEKING PROGRAMMER

An ambitious new project in Oxford needs programmers to join the team.
We're taking a bold approach to open science: help us build a brand new
global platform for scientific knowledge.

The project will involve:

** Writing code for harvesting key information from online documents.
** Building highly scalable databases (eg. MySQL).
** Constructing a web-based user interface (eg. html 5, flash, etc).

We're particularly interested in people who are pragmatic, tenacious, have
a concern for elegance, and love problem-solving.

Think you might be the one? If you can spare at least 5 hours per week,
we'd love to hear from you! Send an email to simon.benjamin
@materials.ox.ac.uk for more details.

Message-ID: <CABPM+wo-h5hUxwk1yQqhb9aFcYsCuZr=Sho8ZybRW+yn-4H2Rw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Some of you might be interested in the following meeting. Registration and
submission of proposals for demos or workshops can be found here
http://www.citizencyberscience.net/summit2/.

We hope to get plenty of OKF representation at the hackfest on the Saturday
so do sign up if you can!

Jenny

*On your marks?*

The London Citizen Cyberscience Summit in 2010 brought together for the
first time *volunteers and scientists* from a wide range of Web-based
science projects, ranging from volunteer computing
(SETI at home,ClimatePrediction.net)
to volunteer thinking (GalaxyZoo, Herbaria at home) to volunteer sensing
(EpiCollect, NoiseTube) and much more.* Historians, journalists, teachers
and businesspeople* all brought their angle on citizen cyberscience to the
event. Above all, it was a chance for the some of the millions of
volunteers who make citizen cyberscience so successful to tell their story.

*Get set?*

The Second London Citizen Cyberscience Summit, *16-18 February 2012*,
promises to be just as pioneering in its scope, and even more innovative in
its format ? ranging from classical academic seminar on the first day,
through to full-fledged open hardware hackfest on the last. It will take
place at the *Royal Geographical Society* (on the 16th) and at *UCL* (17th
and 18th), in London.

*Go!*****

*On Day 1,* we set the scene. (Thursday 16th February 2012, Royal
Geographical Institute). Meet some of the *leading figures in citizen
science* and explore the process of public engagement and participation,
outreach of *citizen science to the developing world*, and the undertaking
of *"extreme" citizen science *projects, in rain forests, arctic tundra, or
urban jungles.****

*On Day 2, *we look beneath the surface. (Friday 17th February 2012, UCL).
Experts will discuss the *hardware and software* that powers citizen
cyberscience. There will be a* panel discussion with citizen scientists* on
why participation and engagement, and a showcase of *new and future citizen
science projects*. Throughout the day, we will start exploring how we can
develop new sensors and software to facilitate citizen science in the
hackfest. There will be plenty of space for unconference sessions and
exploration of new ideas together.****

*On Day 3,* we get down to business?together! (Saturday 18th February 2012)
This will include further *unconference sessions*, and a *hackfest* for
development of hardware and software prototypes, demos and mock-ups, with
awards for the most innovative creations!****

*? Register and buy your ticket <http://lccs2.eventbrite.com/>*

Jenny, I forgot to take an earlier train home... should be around from
about 18:00 GMT, is all goes well...

We're going to bootstrap Maastricht Open Science here, with bi-weekly
lunch meetings... but things have to crystallize a bit more...

Dear all,

The OKFN is delighted to announce the launch of the Panton Fellowships!

Funded by the Open Society Institute, two Panton Fellowships will be
awarded to scientists who actively promote open data in science.

The Fellowships are open to all, and would particularly suit graduate
students and early-stage career scientists. Fellows will have the freedom
to undertake a range of activities, which should ideally complement their
existing work. Panton Fellows may wish to explore solutions for making data
open, facilitate discussion, and catalyse the open science community.

Fellows will receive ?8k p.a. Prospective applicants should send a CV and
covering letter to jobs[@]okfn.org by Friday 24th February.

Full details can be found at [Panton Principles](
http://pantonprinciples.org/panton-fellowships/). You can also see our
[blog post](http://blog.okfn.org/2012/01/25/panton-fellowships-apply-now/).

Please do feel free to circulate these details to interested individuals
and appropriate mailing lists!

Kind regards,
Laura
