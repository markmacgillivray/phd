Message-ID: <CADOXZMyzTUJxguueS-3xNdi6Y3iw76ancRtUx4XW_cx2R=K3Ww@mail.gmail.com>

All,

If there is movement on an open science session, an undergraduate student
in my lab, Kat Badiola, would love to be involved. She's an experimental
scientist doing a fully open source research project in catalysis. She'd
love to work with people developing new tools for open science, and to
apply the tools in her own research - and she'll be at the con with me in
Geneva!

FYI her project blog: http://115.146.85.229/
and lab books: http://115.146.85.148/

She's cc'd, if people are discussing outside this list and would like to cc
her in.

Cheers,

Mat

Praise for BIOHACKERS:

'Alessandro Delfanti provides the definitive account of biohackers, a
motley cohort of scientists, entrepreneurs, and amateur tinkers who are
insisting on openness for their scientific enterprise. Written with nuance
and precision, Delfanti examines key actors who drew inspiration from
long-standing scientific norms and the philosophy of free software in order
to re-imagine and reconstitute their ethos so as to be built upon openness
and access. Delfanti's engrossing account provides a vital road map
essential to understand the past, present, and future of biohacking.' ?
Gabriella Coleman, McGill University and author of 'Coding Freedom: The
Aesthetics and the Ethics of Hacking' (2012)

'Alessandro Delfanti?s book is a deft and accessible introduction to the
changing face of science in the new century. He brings a journalist?s
skill, a scientist?s skepticism and an activist?s passion to the question
of open science today. The work offers an expert analysis of the global
politics of big science and the details and pleasures, the successes and
failures, of small-scale amateur and DIY biology. From the lucid writing
emerges the story of a new ethic of sharing and decoding life - whether
viewed under the microscope or lived out in hackerspaces and garage labs.'
? Christopher Kelty, Associate Professor of Information Studies and
Anthropology, Institute for Society and Genetics, UCLA

'The biohackers are here. In this fascinating book, Alessandro Delfanti
shows us how a new generation of scientists is breaking open the study of
biology with the kinds of countercultural tools first used to hack the
computer. Thanks to their work, science may never be the same again.' ?
Fred Turner, Associate Professor of Communication, Stanford University

---------------------------------------------------------------

BIOHACKERS explores fundamental changes occuring in the circulation and
ownership of scientific information. Alessandro Delfanti argues that the
combination of the ethos of 20th century science, the hacker movement and
the free software movement is producing an open science culture which
redefines the relationship between researchers, scientific institutions and
commercial companies.

BIOHACKERS looks at the emergence of the citizen biology community
?DIYbio?, the shift to open access by the American biologist Craig Venter
and the rebellion of the Italian virologist Ilaria Capua against WHO
data-sharing policies.

Delfanti argues that these biologists and many others are involved in a
transformation of both life sciences and information systems, using open
access tools and claiming independence from both academic and corporate
institutions.

Message-ID: <CAHCs_rbmNNPpGRMEFo3B=c8eDN6WsZxYxv8r=PUGCGUEO5Bzzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I saw this <http://blogs.plos.org/tech/introducing-plos-tech/>, which
is great, I added it to my news reader right away. I so wish I could
go to the meetup mentioned!

Is there any chance that someone could set up streaming? Carl (my
spouse) has experimented with streaming twice at ps1 now, and the last
meeting went fairly smoothly. Our friend Tim worked at PyCon US with
Carl to stream the conference, and the software is open source,
<http://code.timvideos.us/Home.html>. Tim has been working with people
to get make it easier to set up. He's on freenode on #timvideos,
though keeps a very different timezone to yours. We have a friend in
Portland I could ping to see if he would help, and I can also see if
Carl would too (we are only a couple of timezones off from you). If
any of Tim's GSoC students are in the area, maybe they could help.

Hi, Sheila.

What I know is that Alexandre Abdo, from Brazil, will make his presentation
via google hangout to talk about open science in Brazil. It will be a very
short talk, since in the next day we have an open science working we are
organizing here in S?o Paulo <http://www.cienciaaberta.net>.

Maybe you should try to talk directly to organizers and try to join via
google hangout or suggest other possibilities.

Tom

Hi Everton,

Thanks for the suggestion and also the reminder of google hangouts. It
is probably a lot easier to set up a hangout for someone who is not
familiar with the software I was suggesting and maybe even the people
at the US meeting would set it up for the US part of the meeting.

regards

a lightning talk remotely would be possible. Nice to hear that
Alexandre will do one this way.

Subject: [open-science] Data Watch
Message-ID: <CABPM+wp6gbq0-psQ51vsgFLy4vbWsYd2tiu18DxQ+0j3RPfkXg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I'm sure you're familiar with the excellent blog Retraction Watch run by
Ivan Oransky and Adam Marcus http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/

In an blog post in 2012 [1], Jonathan Eisen suggested having a Data Watch
site in the same vein. We discussed something similar in the Open Science
Working Group at various times previously.

We had considered using it to discuss both invalidated datasets (more like
retraction watch) and data sharing cases where data is simply not available
to back up published research, particularly where researchers refuse to
share data despite agreements with funders or publishers to do so on
request. The most well known examples recently being Reinhart-Rogoff [2]
and (many) clinical trials [3].

It would be interesting in the case of datasets found to be invalid to
classify where the problem arose - mislabelling of columns, coding errors,
data gaps?

If you're interested in working on something like this (and the exact
formulation of this is still very much up for discussion - all thoughts
welcome!), then speak now and we can set up a group of founding editors :)

Sounds great! Count me in. I do loathe it when the supporting data is
incomplete or clearly doesn't support the presented results!

(2 slightly different issues, but perhaps there's room to explore both,
with focus on the first)

I'm obviously very supportive of DataWatch.  I think that some of our
activity may be per-journal rather than per-paper (e.g. when Neuroscience
said they no longer required suppdata). DataWatch should then challenge the
policy rather than the instance. And there may be areas where we can give
POSITIVE acclaim where a journal adopts a data pub policy.

Assuming that DataWatch takes off then it gives much more likelihood of
getting responses from editors and publishers and collating policies.

Oh dear, this is finally happening <3 Am in.

Btw, I proposed a combination of talk + workshop on the status of open data
in research for the OKCon, with a friend from Wikimedia France. We're also
planning to be writing a paper on this, very possibly to be submitted to
PLoS ONE. Any input welcome :)

Dear all,

Just a kind reminder that we are trying to set up a date and a time slot
for our second community call regarding the OKCon Open/Citizen Science
satellite event organization.

If you wanna join, please select a date: http://doodle.com/ghaagbppet256gst

Thus far, the most plebiscited slot is June 17, 5pm CEST.

Thanks and looking forward to talking to you all :)

All

Am forwarding this to the group - had sent it to Jenny Molloy in our 1-1
discussions

"My original thought on this was to focus on data that was not even made
available yet should have been.  I had envisioned a site where anyone could
post a notice saying "I tried to get this data but couldn't" and even
offering a service to contact authors and editors anonymously so that
people could request access without fear of some sort of retribution.

I had not thought of the issue of data quality that you mentioned in the
group email.  But I can see how that might be connected."

Might be a little dated based on the current emails but figured I would
just forward this to the group ...

Thanks Jonathan

What are people's thoughts on the angle that would be most worth taking
here? It may be that we're talking about two separate projects...

My response to Jonathan:

That was the other angle we were thinking of as well, it's a discussion
worth having which of these is the most useful or if both are and whether
to focus on just one.

The contacting service is a good idea, it's been raised by editors at
meetings I've been to that while they may require data sharing on request
they hardly ever get contacted to say someone isn't doing what they're
supposed to so it's very difficult to enforce.

[OKF have] implemented data request services before although for open
availability rather than availability per se and they weren't anonymous,
but in principle some of the setup could be reused.

I would be curious what is meant by "aggregate" in this context. I am
wondering whether the term "federate" fits here, by which I mean that,
when one aggregates, one also organizes according to the topic(s) in
play. Am I close?

a service http://www.isitopendata.org/ the purpose of which was to ask data
providers (especially publishers) whether their data was open. It was
modelled on (or inspired by) whatdotheyknow.com (an FOI request service).

One serious problem was that there is no formal contact in many
organizations and there is no legal requirement even to reply.

After the last few mails I think there are a number of valuable things that
might be done and we need to outline them clearly and decide which we want
to put effort into.

Yes. The intended goal is to reach of better mass by federating voices
under a certain relevant topic of interest.

One expression of this idea would be to go beyond the fact that
'Journal of Topic A' and 'Applied Journal of Topic A' don't do well in
promoting access to data while highlighting that 'Open Journal of
Topic A' does a better job, but also that the Topic A community
neglects data sharing in general compared to Topic B community.

Spinning the idea of an anonymous data sharing on request service a
little further: what is missing to get this automated?

I guess a very practical issue would be that journal articles (with
the exception of some types of data papers) are not marked up for the
type of data they are reporting on, and an automated generic request
to authors "please send me the data underlying your paper X" may well
be less efficient in gathering responses than something of the sort
"please send me the T2-weighted images of the control group in
experiment 2, along with the respective blood screenings".

But then again, exposing the (probably large) amount of non-responses
may be a nice basis for triggering discussions (which would have to be
field-specific, at least initially) on how to move towards more
effective ways of sharing data.

In cases where the authors actually do respond by sending some data,
the next challenge is then to determine what to do with it, since it
(a) is most likely not licensed for sharing further
(b) may have legit restrictions on sharing (e.g. patient privacy,
endangered species)
(c) may be in a proprietary or non-standard format
(d) may be incomplete
(e) may or may not be of a type for which suitable repositories exist
etc.

These latter considerations would apply whether the requests are
automated or not, and it could serve as the basis for a DataWatch
inititative that looks for problems in those data that are shared or
for which some available statements (e.g. in the respective papers)
are unclear or contradictory.

So while the data requesting and data watching ideas are heavily
intertwined, I think they require different skill and knowledge sets
and will probably appeal to different groups of people (some overlap
not withstanding). The data watching part will require field-specific
(or at least data type-specific) knowledge, for which OKF on its own
is not necessarily the best framework, but the data requesting part
sounds like something others are very unlikely to tackle.

Some more thoughts:
- If automation is not in reach, perhaps crowdsourcing may be an
option, for which I see two major ways:
(1) via the public (classical citizen science of the pybossa-supportable kind)
(2) via funders and the reports they request from their grantees
(Knowledge Exchange are looking to expand their activities in the
areas of open knowledge and open culture and might be open to
experiments along these lines - I have sent in an OKCon submission
with them after attending a meeting on the matter).
In both cases, much depends on a suitably designed request form (easy
to fill in, easy to tailor to the specifics of a paper or dataset).

- Getting useful metadata is often a big challenge if data sharing was
not built in from the start.

- If we think about data watching, the sharing code should be
considered as well.

Hi all,

Wanted to point you to this interesting insight in the open access
discussion, this time from a publisher's perspective.

Have a nice weekend.

Cheers,

Dear Joris,

It is a pity that I've just realize about this today, sorry ;-) In the
Spanish world there is a very interesting editorial approach to openness
and how they are making profit for producing a high quality magazine
(almost 1kg each issue) free of cost on the web without adds, where the
writers, artists, etc. can do whatever they want: no editorial line ;-)

The name of the magazine is Orsai <http://editorialorsai.com/> and I think
you will love it http://editorialorsai.com/revista/

The interesting approach of this magazine is that people actually pay the
magazine even before it is made and you don't know the actual contents of
it. I actually bought the first issue and people got very crazy about it
;-)

I found about this project on a blog post, actually everything started in a
blog by Hern?n Casciari, the co-founder of the magazine. In this blog post
he quit his jobs in two main newspapers (one from Spain and another one
from Argentina) and from several editorials like Plaza Jane or Grijalbo,
very popular in the Spanish speaking countries. The blog post was amazing
and engaging, basically because they wanted to create a magazine for
readers by readers, so they basically quit their jobs and started working
on the idea. The first issue was bought by 10,000 people without knowing
anything about the contents.

You can buy the magazine or wait 10 days to get the PDF version for free,
so you can read it in your e-book, tablet or laptop. They are shipping to
all latin american countries, and the cost is exactly the cost of 15
newspapers in the country that wants the magazine. This is very
interesting, because for example some big editorials do not ever ship some
books to small countries, so it is not possible for them to buy it. Their
shipping model is also interesting because the readers are in charge of
deliver the issues to their colleagues, in words of Hern?n Casciari: we are
killing the intermediary.

The success of this story is really beautiful. Now they have opened an
editorial where all the authors receive 50% of the benefits of their
products, they want people to copy, remix, etc. the contents and even a bar
model where the readers again, are the main investors for the business
model.

I think this story is beautiful and if this is happening in the Spanish
humanities, why not in science?

All the best,

Daniel

Message-ID: <CANACerFiQbb059mHjH4yEVmcXhQY2uKneEL5e6UrRpgNpdw2Fw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I'm delighted to invite you this summer at our event, NightScience. It's to
be held between July 12 and 14, in Paris.

The focus is 'hacking education', and the program encompasses a day of
talks and 2 days of hands-on activities (a hackathon). Quite a few names
you know well are to be noted among whom is Cameron Neylon :)

Our aim is to bridge the gap between 'formal' and 'informal' knowledge
creators and craft novel tools and content that are open, free (as in
'freedom', not as in 'free beer'), co-created & evolvable.

For further details, check out our website: http://nightscience.org/en/ and
follow us on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Nightscience

Looking forward to welcoming you in Paris :)
Rayna

Just a reminder that the deadline for JISC elevator awards is coming up if
you know any students who have a teaching/research tech idea they'd like
funded!
Brendan (cc'd), an Oxford Open Science attendee, is pitching for WikiNets -
project description below.

If you have comments I'm sure he would be interested - and even more so if
you wanted to vote for the project ;)
Please do shout out if you've made an entry yourself, it would be great to
hear about it.

WikiNets - Mapping the Research Frontier, Together

The Idea
Research is all about the big picture. WikiNets is a way of drawing the big
picture. It?s an online tool for piecing together the contributions of many
researchers into a graphical form that is easy to read, understand, and
remember. WikiNets does this by facilitating the collaborative creation of
annotated networks that represent all relevant variables in a domain of
research, and their relationships. Imagine a streamlined Wikipedia, built
to focus on the links.

Hi Prakash,

Yes, I'm afraid if you read the full eligibility guidelines here:
http://pantonprinciples.org/panton-fellowships/, the Fellowships are only
open to applicants from within the EU region.

Sorry.

I think it would be administratively difficult for OKF & CCIA to offer the
fellowships outside of this region. However, if the scheme continues to be
a success, perhaps in later years it might be possible to have Panton
Fellows across the world...?

Regards,

Ross

First of all congratulations to OKFN for getting this funding. (I knew this
was happening but couldn't say anything).

When we set up the first PFs we considered making available to anyone, but
the administrative details for managing this were too complex at that stage
for what was a small amount of management resource. We decided to start
with the UK where we had the legal and financial structure and to look to
expand later.

I am delighted that we have been able to expand to the EU. Who knows what
will be possible in the future? One hope is that we'll find increasing
numbers of funders and these may have geographical interests.

My life has been enormously enriched by working with Sophie and Ross and
I'm really looking forward to seeing the next round of applications.

P.

deadline for submissions to the Veni Competition, which is open to
everyone.

With the deadline on *27 June *and a total prize fund* of 5.000 EUR*, the
Veni Competition is looking for prototypes and demos that use linked and/or
open data for educational purposes. Find out more on our website: http://
linkedup-challenge.org/, or feel free to ping me an email.

Best wishes,

Tutorial to be held in connection with TPDL 2013, 22 September 2013, Valletta, Malta http://www.tpdl2013.info/



From Preserving Data to Preserving Research:

Curation of Process and Context

ABSTRACT

In the domain of eScience, investigations are increasingly collaborative. Most scientific and engineering domains benefit from building on the outputs of other research: by sharing information to reason over and data to incorporate in the modeling task at hand. This raises the need for preserving and sharing entire eScience workflows and processes for later reuse. We need to define which information is to be collected, create means to preserve it and approaches to enable and validate the re-execution of a preserved process. This includes and goes beyond preserving the data used in the experiments, as the process underlying its creation and use is essential.

The TIMBUS project and Wf4Ever project team up for this half-day tutorial to provide an introduction to the problem domain and discuss solutions for the curation of eScience processes.

1.     TUTORIAL LEVEL
Introductory level
2.     DURATION
Half-day
3.     OUTLINE OF THE CONTENT
The tutorial will cover the following topics:
Introduction to Process and Context Preservation: The introduction will motivate the need for process and context preservation, illustrate how this task is difficult in an evolving domain, and introduce a use case for the rest of the tutorial to illustrate approaches and tools.
Data Citation: Data forms the basis of the results of many research publications, and thus needs to be referenced with the same accuracy as bibliographic data. Only if data can be identified with high precision can it be reused, validated, verified and reproduced. Citing a specific data set is however not trivial - it exists in a vast plurality of specifications and instances, can potentially be huge in size, and its location might change. We will provide an overview over existing approaches to overcoming these challenges. Further, we will present the issue of creating data citations of data held in databases, especially of dynamic data sets where data is added or updated on a regular basis.
Re-usability and traceability of workflows and processes: The processes creating and interpreting data are complex objects. Curating and preserving them requires special effort, as they are dynamic, and highly dependent on software, configuration, hardware, and other aspects. We will discuss these issues in detail, and provide an introduction to two complementary approaches.
The first approach is based on the concept of Research Objects, which adopts a workflow-centric approach and thereby aims at facilitating the reuse and reproducibility. It allows packaging the data and the methods as one Research Object to share and cite it, and thus enable publishers to grant access to the actual data and methods that contribute to the findings reported in scholarly articles.
A second approach focuses on describing and preserving a process and the context it is embedded in. The artifacts that may need to be captured range from data, software and accompanying documentation, to legal and human resource aspects. Some of this information can be automatically extracted from an existing process, and tools for this will be presented. Ways to archive the process and to perform preservation actions on the process environment, such as recreating a controlled execution environment or migration of software components, are presented. Finally, the challenge of evaluating the re-execution of a preserved process is discussed, addressing means of establishing its authenticity.
4.     INTENDED AUDIENCE
The tutorial is targeted at researchers, publishers and curators in eScience disciplines who want to learn about methods of ensuring the long-term availability of experiments forming the basis of scientific research.
5.     EXPECTED LEARNING OUTCOMES
The tutorial participants will become understand
?       Motivations and challenges of process preservation
?       Motivations, stakeholders and challenges of making data citable

Subject: [open-science] "HackYourPhD aux States" : a web documentary about
	OpenScience
Message-ID: <CAEFac5hcLPAHgV86n2MAam0tzLH8zLyxqP0_ZRTG4NZD95gHUw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am the co founder of the HackYourPHD <http://hackyourphd.org> community.
I contact you to present this project but also ask some help for a web
documentary about Open Science that I will conduce across the US this
summer.

*What is HackYourPhD ?

*"Hack your Phd" launched in December 2012 in France, brings together a
diverse community around the issues of Open Science and Open Knowledge. It
gathers mostly *young scientists* (PhD students; post-docs; researchers)
but also *other profiles* like designers and social entrepreneurs.

For 6 months, we have constituted a *daily collaborative curation* about
Open Science with a Facebook
group<https://www.facebook.com/groups/499463776745202/>of more than
400 members (in French and English). We also organize
workshops about the new practices in research. The central idea is to use
the collective intelligence emerging from the different horizons
represented in our community through the new tools from science and open
education. HackYourPhd wants to show that new ways of doing research exist,
and can both benefit research itself but the relationship between science
and society as well.

We already have organized *6 events in Paris* about specific topics (e.g
peer-review & scientific evaluation, new data representation with
mindmaping, etc.), and are planning to organize other workshops soon
about intellectual
property & license in research, and how to write collaboratively a thesis.
Each time, a young researcher (PhD student or post-doc) proposes a topic.
HackYourPhD helps him to organize the event, connect people with diverse
profile and write a post in our website after. Most of the article are in
French right now but we will translate it in English soon.

*Project of web documentary about Open Knowledge and Science: ?HackYourPhD
aux States?: *


Open Science starts to have more visibility in France, most notably with
the work of OKFN France. But it stays something totally new for a lot of
researchers, media etc. It is important for *HackYourPhD to meet existing
Open Knowledge and Open Science* actors to bring all these good
inspirations in the French community.

We thus launched a crowd-funding campaign that is still running. It's about
funding a trip to meet as many as possible actors of the* Open Knowledge
and Science field to show the diversity of initiatives and point of views
about those new practices.* My wish is to inspire and impact our
communities in France.
You can find there the detail of the trip and the purpose of this project: *
HackYourPhD.org/USA*

*I contacted you to help me organizing this travel.* I would like* to do
several interviews of open science advocator from academic research,
startups etc.* I would like also to visit some innovative space as
bio-hackerspace, design school, Fablab, etc.
Then I would like to organize one local events in each city to meet you
around a drink. I know that OKFN is organizing a lot of meet up and *I am
keen of to be part of it or even organize one.* I have already subscribed
to the OKFN Boston and San Francisco meet up.

Here is the global schedule with all the cities I will visit:

*July 12th:* San Diego (a biohackerspace is opening soon, Joseph Jackson
contact)
*July 16th:* Los Angeles (We already have a meet up with a HackYourPhD
connector let me know if you live there or if you have some contact)
*July 19th to 26th:* San Francisco bay area (I am sure you have a lot of
contact there)
*July 28th to August 2nd:* transit to Seattle
*August 2nd to 8th:* Seattle (I am in contact with the Open Science
Federation)
*August 9th to 13th:* Montreal (I will organize a workshop about a
crowdfuning project with some friends there)
*August 14th to 20th:* Boston (I have some contacts there but I am sure you
can help me)
*August 21th to 26th:* NYC
*August 27th to early September:* Charlotesville (Open Science center)

 Don't hesitate to contact me to share contacts of open knowledge/science
actors or even couchsurfers?.
We would of course greatly appreciate if you can spread the link of our
crowdfunding campaign in your social networks: HackYourPhD.org/USA

Cheers!

Hello C?lya, I am also copying the OKFN-US list, and I encourage people to
reply with suggestions. Everyone, please see C?lya's schedule of cities she
will visit this Summer in her message below, for a documentary on Open
Knowledge and Open Science.

It is a great idea to have a public event in each city you visit, and to
combine Open Science events with broader OKF meetup groups.

I know all of those cities have regular tweetups, hackdays, and panel
events that intersect with Open Science, except Charlottesville. They are a
college town, where all the Open Science activity I know of is associated
with the University of Virginia, including the new Center for Open Science.

In the cities, many Open Science related events are organized by
ScienceOnline <http://scienceonline.com/near-you/>, in New York that plus
SpotOn <http://www.nature.com/spoton/in/new-york/>, or  by nonprofits, or
each city also has more than one university. There are fewer Summer events
in general, but by combining groups who do not normally organize together,
such as ScienceOnline, a university, and a local biohackerspace, there will
be enough people and a good mix of Open Science.

In addition to San Diego's, there are community wet labs in New York,
Boston, San Francisco, and Seattle, and all of those cities have more than
a few general hackerspaces that do some science. I'll talk to you soon with
more specifics, let's see what anyone else adds. BG

Nothing on principles/standards, but presume they are talking about open
data as per Panton Principles. Hopefully we'll hear more about this in the
coming days!

Thank you  Brian

I realy appreciate your help and the great support of OpenScience
Federation since the beginning of HackYourPhD.

To facilitate the organisation, I've just created a
spreadsheet<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkQhh7Y8VYCQdEZJYUF1S2dacGdfRzI3eXdyU1pSc0E#gid=7>,
where you can add your name and your avaibility in order to meet me for an
interview.
It's a great idea to have a public event in each city with OKFN, Science
Online or Spot.on.  If you want to help me to organize it, feel free to
propose a date, a place...

Thanks again. And I'm looking forward to meeting all of you.

PS : we 've reached 65% of our crowdfunding campaign in 14 days.
If you want to give a hand, don't hesistate to share it and/or back it !

Subject: [open-science] Community Calendar
Message-ID: <CABPM+wrMeCeJYL-h7igQZTxL9skNQLaXTNVL+CPRBRuxyaqcUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

The open science working group decided we would like an community events
calendar to which anyone could add open science related events by any group
(probably with one click moderation to avoid spam and off-topic additions
but we want management to be as simple as possible).

Ideally this would populate a simple spreadsheet so the data could be
represented in different ways using people's tool of choice e.g. maps,
calendars, timelines etc without too much technical knowledge.

Stefan Kasberger started looking into this during a recent session to
update the working group website, our current plan was a google
form->spreadsheet->calendar set up as per this blog post
http://blog.ouseful.info/2010/03/04/maintaining-google-calendars
-from-a-google-spreadsheet/

However, people may have better ideas or know of an existing system. We
looked but couldn't find anything that was easily embedded in a website and
didn't require being added to the calendar to post events.

Any comments or offers of assistance to build this would be very much
appreciated as other working groups might also be interested in a similar
tool, particularly if, as is the case for open science, there is a growing
collection of OKF and non-OKF groups running events in many locations and
currently no central place to keep track of them all.

I have added this to the OKF Ideas board if you'd like to comment on there
or add yourself to the card.
https://trello.com/card/community-calendar-for-working-groups-to-which-anyone-can-add-events/5183bdd42f8056ea7800360c/24

Thanks very much!

Hi Jenny et al.,

We have discussed and false-started the same a few times in the Open
Science Federation. I will reshare this in our channels as well, it's a
great idea whose time was yesterday :) One calendar to find them, one
calendar to bring them all... and in the open bind them? That's a bit of a
stretch but it's still early over here. BG

 Linked and Open Data in Education!
Message-ID: <CAB53Ly4-d5duUt5E5Z8oPeuigWVURffMkAqR+ZLLazB-bGemfw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Can you create a guidance system to help self-learner search and select
online courses that seem to best suit their needs? Could you find a way to
make research papers more accessible, and more easily read by less-advanced
learners? Or have you any thoughts on how teachers in the developing world
can benefit from the open resources freely available online?

Well, there is still time to enter the Veni Competition! Whilst there are
just 9 days remaining, that's enough time to pull together a prototype or
demo that analyses and/or integrates linked and open web data for
educational purposes.

With a total prize fund of 5,000 EUR, and our award ceremony taking place
at OKCon <http://okcon.org/> in Geneva on 17 September 2013, there is no
excuse not to enter!

Find out more on our blog <http://linkedup-project.eu/2013/06/17/524> or on
our website <http://linkedup-challenge.org/>.

Best wishes

Subject: [open-science] Outlining the argument for open commercialization
Message-ID: <CAFnzOmaNWjM5RA0h1jcBV3uDYXCp2vKtyp9bwH=yJ=dBzfv_4Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm a researcher at Michigan State University and am putting together a
presentation to promote the concept of open commercialization (bringing
technology to market without IP) to admin higher-ups  and I'd like your
help.

*I am looking for more examples to strengthen and simplify the arguments
for open commercialization (no intellectual property) versus traditional
commercialization*.  Ultimately, I would like to see this outline as
something that anyone can use to make a similar pitch at other universities.

If you'd like to help, please read through the
outline<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v4bs4SfWk39UmMtxYYeW4DZwEE7lsFHGqoPMIy--C68/edit?usp=sharing>in
google docsand add arguments, examples, and links wherever you see
fit.  I've already
noted many places in the outline where I think specific examples would be
valuable.

*Please please share this with other people or lists that you think may be
helpful!*

I think that the time is ripe for making this argument, and Universities
may be ready to consider moving back towards a truly open model of
information.  Thanks so much for your help!

Subject: [open-science] Open Science and OKF at the White House this week
Message-ID: <CAKO=0K2HR1t2hscWQph=+3N3NYHr2R_GCYxQYU6hJ6QdNeg9Wg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

Along with at least a couple other people on this list, I have been invited
to the White House for the Champions of Change in Open Science event this
Thursday, <
http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/07/seeking-outstanding-open-science-champions-change
>. I was invited to represent the Open Science Federation but will of
course have on my OKF lapel pin -- well if they existed, then I would wear
one!

Will anyone else be there who is officially from or affiliated with
OKF? Granted
this is a decidedly American event, and small because few in a massive
country can be invited, I thought maybe, per the recent data.gov CKAN
deployment and other Washington, DC - OKF connections.

In my conversations there -- I don't expect to give any remarks -- I want
to underline the contributions of this working group, of OKF and
connections between Open Science and other areas of Open Knowledge, and
finally the importance of the international Open Science community. This is
somewhat contrary the recognition of individual Americans for their
achievements, but I've been called worse than contrarian.

Tea leaves indicate WH awards are understandably political, e.g. likely to
focus on US federal grant recipients and not likely to represent the
breadth of the Open Science community, even in America. That's not a
complaint of course; it's their award! I will try to be grateful and also
not kick anyone in the shins too hard over being less than open as OKF, and
I define it.

I should restate my own OKF affiliations. The Advisory for this Open
Science Working Group has not taken many meetings, but I was and am happy
to volunteer for that. My general volunteerism with OKF extends back
roughly five years, and has included bits and pieces like improvements to
the OKF network of WordPress sites. We in the Open Science Federation share
access to our accounts, such as @openscience on Twitter, with people who
are also active with OKF, and our circles overlap significantly with this
list.

Here in the States, I am also active in open government and have often
introduced OKF code and projects at hackdays, and have co-organized OKF
meetups. Finally and more substantively, I recently began a stronger tie to
OKF by co-founding a local group in the US, which we started in earnest
only in later 2012. We are not only focused on Open Science, of course, but
here for example is a comment I left recently at PLOS on our support of the
OKF meetup they hosted
http://blogs.plos.org/tech/recipe-for-a-good-event/#comment-341.

We are a registered nonprofit organization of which I am the president, not
because I think that's representative of our cooperative efforts but
because legally, someone needs to be. We are currently pursuing formal
chapter status with OKF, but are not OKF's only American representatives.
There are a couple American OKF staff, a new Ambassador in Texas, and we
hope for more of that in addition to the national chapter.

Our first office is in Seattle, where later today a group of us will be
hacking at http://us.okfn.org to better represent our projects, and we're
also active at https://twitter.com/okfnus. BG

Hi Brian,

I guess that event is a good chance to get in touch with some
interesting people - either because they have opened up their
workflows or because they did not yet. I shall be interested in what
comes out of it.

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi Brian: I was invited as well, but unfortunately I have a conflict and
will not be able to attend. I hope we cross paths on another occasion.

Greg,

I like what you're trying to do, and I'm trying to find similar examples to
counter the prevailing wisdom re drug discovery. I think you'll have a hard
time convincing anyone in a Uni environment of anything without not just
examples but peer-reviewed examples. I speak often about the power of first
mover advantage, but to take that to a formal audience I'd need a proper
source. However, you could start with these:

1) Intellectual Property Rights and Innovation: Evidence from the Human
Genome, H. L. Williams, Journal of Political Economy 2013, 121, 1-27
(10.1086/669706)

2) The Case Against Patents, M. Boldrin and D. K. Levine, Journal of
Economic Perspectives 2013, 27, 3-22 (10.1257/jep.27.1.3)

Boldrin and Levine also have a book on the same subject with an interesting
chapter on drug discovery, reminding us that penicillin and the polio
vaccine were products of great value to public health brought to the market
with no IP protection.

You might also like the anecdote I mention about prizes in the blog post I
just wrote:

http://intermolecular.wordpress.com/2013/06/07/open-source-competitions-and-prizes-1/

Your question is very significant. It's to my mind the heart of whether
open science can become more widespread. A referee comment on a grant
proposal I have under review right now expressed the worry that openness
would "prevent commercialization" and of course I argued that the opposite
is the case, but had nothing I could reference cleanly. Assembling a list
of examples (with sources) is a great idea, and would make a neat article.

Cheers,

Mat

Hi Greg,

I'm commenting here, as I'm not really sure where does it fit in your outline.

First, there are a few arguments for opening certain resources as a
part of bussiness strategy, as it:
- allows for redefining bussiness model (or develop additional
bussiness models - think Apache or RedHat; there was an open
consulting company back then in 2009, I cannot find the name right
now)
- makes it harder to block the company (protection against patent
trolls and others, see for example Intellectual Property Program from
SAE Consortium http://www.saeconsortium.org/index.php?q=node/12 )
- lets the company to actually set the industry standard in just
forming areas of commercialization (Raspberry Pi? I think it has a
better business strategy than Arduino)

Second, there is a legal layer to the process of opening a resource. I
think it is worth looking into strong copyleft (so called viral)
licenses. Businesses like them, as it adds another mechanism of
protection of their actual positition.

Actually, I gave a talk similar to the outline above. If you are
interested (or anybody else of course), I can mail the slides directly
to you (or anybody else). Unfortunately, this were one of these
meetings, where the materials cannot be shared on the public forum (I
know, in principle nobody cares, but I prefer to stick to the spirit
of the agreement).

Best wishes
PS

Reading through the outline again I thought I would add one more point
to the discussion.

Suddenly (well, over couple of years), many people and organizations
started looking into alternatives (including open models) not because
_they_ had changed. Economy had changed. They would continue to throw
money at any problems and challenges if they swam in cash like Scrooge
McDuck. But they don't anymore. I don't think most of the people would
seriously consider a bumpy ride on off the beaten path of open
commercialization, if the current situation wasn't muddle-through
economy (phrase coined by John Mauldin, one of my favourite analysts
out there).

PS

Subject: [open-science] software to extract text from pdf
Message-ID: <04a601ce6d80$ea2d1e70$be875b50$@amnh.org>

Dear all

 

We work on a project to convert taxonomic publications into semantically enhanced linked xml documents (and ultimately to add them to our databases at http://plazi.org)

 

There are principally two import formats, pdf with images (or scanned images of text) and born-digital pdfs. 

 

For the latter, we would like to find an open source tool that allows the extraction of text from the pdf, with a constraints: 

We need the page numbers and breaks (to be able to define the position of text blocks since in our world the citations lead back to the page where a taxon is being described, that is the treatment), and thus the output has to include this.

We deal with many tables. They have to be dealt with. We have not found tools that deliver this.

We have many special sympols ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? 

We would like to run batch files to produce automated output.

 

Has anybody an idea where we could find this?

 

The focus on treatment is, because this is the taxonomist's currency, and because we can deal with them due to their nature that does not qualify them as work (in a legal sense) and thus are out of copyright.

 

Best thanks for a hint

Dear Donat

I was very interested in your query and asked a colleague who has recently been engaged in this exact process (for similar reason). She utilised a proprietory software package called Omnipage ? and offered the comment: "No good open source alternative that can give the same level of accuracy and conversion power that I know of."

We would be very interested to know if anyone has better (free, open) suggestions.

Dear Michelle

 

Thanks for this ? so far we used ABBYY (also a prorietory software) but they do not offer text extraction from pdfs, and there is a limitation on adding page breaks (that worked to their version 8, and that's why we decided to use ABBYY and not Omnipage.

 

Do you know, whether Omnipage allows batch processing? Any idea how well it extracts tables etc.?

 

Still, an open sources would be welcome?

 

Cheers

 

Donat

Thank you everyone for your comments, help, slides, and suggestions!

Re Florence - I'm using the words "open commercialization" not to exclude
other words, but simply because that's the broadest terms I can put it in.
Commercialization just means making a technology available to a market (end
users)... so that's a very broad definition and leaves it up to the person
doing the work how that process is organized, if it's for profit, etc.  So
to me all the great work done in the collaborative economy completely fits
into that definition.  However, so do awesome projects like publiclab.org,
which is a traditional non-profit but is definitely commercialization
technology and developing platforms to engage citizens in science, or
Arduino or Raspberry Pi which make money from a product but do not hold
exclusive rights to the hardware or software (though they do trademark the
name).

As in all cases, there are shades of openness, and if we could get
universities in the US to move an inch in that direction it'd be a huge
plus.  Perhaps some folks on the list don't know, but in the US most
(though not all) universities requires professors, researchers, grad
students, post docs, etc. to sign away their intellectual property rights
when they start working.  So technology development decisions are basically
in the hands of the tech transfer department (created through Bay Dohl act
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayh%E2%80%93Dole_Act), which most often
leads nowhere, and occasionally leads to a patent which even more rarely
leads to a product usually drowns in the cost of it's own IP.  The main
site for accumulating this information is here:
http://www.autm.net/source/STATT/index.cfm?section=STATT , but of course
you have to pay to get the data :)

In addition, Universities (both public and private) in the US are
constantly fighting for more funds, as public funding is dropping like a
stone.  There is an increasing reliance on external funding, and an
expectation that anything which is done within the university MUST bring in
additional money from outside to be considered at all.  So that puts a lot
of pressure on open commercialization models because it's somewhat hard to
argue they will generate more money, though there are many many other
benefits (PR and branding, decrease costs, more consistent with the core
values of the U, higher impact, etc. etc.) which others like Pawel have
outlined.  It's possible to argue that you can get more grant money by
opening up a project, but again we need lots of examples to be convincing.

Sorry for the rant... but if we could really reinforce this argument
effectively with case examples especially those relating to funding and
especially ones from the literature as Mat said then we'd have a better
chance.  And it only makes sense to share that argument and examples, as
this argument will be in large part the same everywhere.

Building this argument will take some time, and it may not be structured
effectively in the google doc now (it's a bit of a mess), so feel free to
jump in and make it better.

Thanks,

Greg

Have you looked at pdftotext? This seems to be the open source tool
most people use on Linux/Unix. On Debian-based systems, it is included
in the poppler-utils package. A Windows version can be downloaded here:
http://www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html

By default, pdftotext inserts an ASCII formfeed character (decimal 12,
hexadecimal 0xC, sometimes written as ^L) to indicate line breaks. If
you know the page number of the first page, you can use this character
to determine all subsequent page numbers.

Tables are beyond the capabilities of pdftotext. It puts each table
cell on a new line, it seems, and it is hard to spot where a row
started or ended.

PDFX might be able to do more: http://pdfx.cs.man.ac.uk/
Unfortunately, I could not find a download link there, and the web
service is limited to documents of at most 100 pages.

Luckily, there is an open source alternative: LA-PDFText
https://code.google.com/p/lapdftext/

These and other tools relevant to scientific communication are listed
here: http://www.force11.org/tools

I hope this helps.
Christian

BTW: Are your going to share your presentation?

Great - thanks for the examples!

I will definitely share the presentation.  This first one (which is Monday)
will be short and focused on our specific project called Photosynq.  But we
hope that it will spark a broader discussions which would use more of these
examples and arguments.

Also, I did a small talk at Nerd Nite about this subject - a little more
tongue and cheek and a different audience, but it may be useful for others:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v95kZUXy87c&feature=youtu.be

I made a folder to put similar presentations, pitches, etc. - feel free to
throw things in there.  If your talk was recorded, please include a link of
the video:
https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByqRYMgnYFjBLW04bnVYeWpQZTQ&usp=sharing

Not sure exactly the right way to organize this, but least getting similar
things in one place is useful.

Subject: [open-science] software to extract text from pdf

Hi,

How do you want to use tools? Do you want to incorporate them in to some
software you are building, or would you just like to have something that
you can use without working about adding it to something else?

For getting tables from pdfs there is tabula running as a web service.

http://source.mozillaopennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-tabula/

I used it via starting up an instance of their ami in amazon, and then had
to edit some settings to make it accept more than the default size of pdf,
since the pdf I wanted to use was larger than the default. I don't know how
accessible this is to you, is it something that sounds reasonably doable?

For text from images, I tried tesseract-ocr, with imagemagick, and bash. I
am definitely not an expert and did not finesse anything in this case. I
did this from an ubuntu machine, and found an ubuntu page on OCR

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OCR

The page had a bash script, which I destroyed until it looked like so since
I didn't need everything in their script. It is embarassing really. I was
lazy since I didn't want to type everything at the command line. It is
really dumb and not intelligent about checking args, or letting you have
more options, and it clobbers files and so on.

#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    echo "usage: $0 pdfname"
    exit
fi

convert -monochrome -density 300 $1 pdf.tif
tesseract pdf.tif outputfile

Under authoring tools I can recommend etherpad. It's like googledocs, but
better in ways. Mozilla and other places run pads, or you can run your own.

https://etherpad.mozilla.org/
There is also an htmlpad, http://htmlpad.org/

I also just found out about prose.io which works with github.com, which
means you can ask friends who are not familiar with git and github.com to
edit files with you as though they were wiki pages until they become more
comfortable with git and the file system, or not.

A number of us have been developing Open Source software for exactly this
purpose. There is a general project "Jailbreaking the PDF" which has
brought together about 5-7 groups , all of whom have different things to
contribute. Here's my account:
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2013/05/28/jailbreaking-the-pdf-a-wonderful-hackathon-and-a-community-leap-forward-for-freedom-1/

This community effort is tackling PDFs for science, but in addition Ross
Mounce and I are specifically targetting phylogenetics and (by implication)
taxonomy. We have prototyped methods to extract trees from diagrams and
species from text.

Note that the PDF quality of scholarly articles is often very non-standard.
You mention a range of symbols - it is highly unlikely that academic
publishers use Unicode for these and they need heuristic translation - I
would not expect commercial packages to do a good job on some academic
publishers' symbols. Our community - which anyone can join is growing and
is probably the best place to develop solutions.

Our own contribution which deals with character conversion is
http://www.bitbucket.org/petermr/pdf2svg-dev. This converts the raw PDF to
Unicode as far as is possible (we often require per-publisher tables).

I would be very happy to look at your examples, but am away from the
interent for a few days.

P.

In the link there they suggest trying dochive, but can't give any report on
that. I haven't tried it.

"Tabula only works on text-based PDFs only, so you?re still stuck with
manual labor if you have scanned PDFs. Free OCR technology is not quite to
the point where we?d trust automating it with many pages of data. For those
files, Raleigh Public Record?s DocHive is worth a look."
http://www.raleighpublicrecord.org/
https://github.com/raleighpublicrecord/dochive/tree/master/dochive

It uses tesseract, and I don't know if they do more or less than what I got
trying to use tesseract by hand -- and I wasn't trying to scan tables, I
was just scanning citations.

Most of the time, tesseract fails out of the box. The tesseract
documentation recommends running lots of training on the specific types of
data you are scanning. I haven't put the time into doing this yet. It would
be nice to eventually scan some of the CRC handbook data.

I am not sure in what way tesseract failed for you. The way it
processes command line options is rather finicky, and its error
messages are not very helpful. That is why I patched a friendly little
Ruby script called pdfocr to make it work with tesseract. It takes a
PDF containing only scanned page images, runs an OCR engine on it, and
adds the recognized text as a background layer to the PDF. My patch
has been integrated into the main line of development three months
ago: https://github.com/gkovacs/pdfocr

> The tesseract documentation recommends running lots of training on

I never needed to train tesseract. Models for lots of languages are
freely available.

Cheers,
Christian

Hi Greg,

I am the founder of an Open Source, Open (mostly) Hardware social
enterprise called Village Telco
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3BgVknO9c8).  Our experience with
Open Hardware, as complete novices to manufacturing, has been the
following:

1/ Open Hardware is a great means to getting to a quick understanding
with a manufacturer.  Open Source licenses are a shortcut to trust and
sharing our schematics up front with the manufacturer quickly
established a relationship where we felt comfortable with each other.
That continues to this day.

2/ Open Source / Open Hardware attracts smart people and good will.
It is a great way to build a community around your product, get input,
fix problems, etc.

3/ Finding investors is hard.  Most investors want to know how they
are going to get their money out if things go pear-shaped.  IP is the
obvious way for them to have something to hold on to.  I have not
found an obvious way round this.

4/ Open Hardware is NOT the same as Open Source.   The analogy does
not map very well.  With Open Source the intent is for people to
replicate and expand on your code.  This is less true with Open
Hardware partly because it is harder to replicate hardware than code
but also because when you are dealing with sophisticated hardware,
someone else's patents tend to get in the way.  In order to work on
our chosen platform (Atheros) we had to sign an NDA which directly
limits what we can share.  Compare the Raspberry Pi with the Arduino.
Arduino really is Open Hardware and there are many variations to prove
it.  There will only ever be one Raspberry Pi because of the
relationship with Broadcom and the proprietary technologies wrapped up
in their chips, not to mention the need for sophisticated
manufacturing facilities.  Yet the Raspberry Pi is a huge success
because it is open to work with (open firmware, exposed GPIOs, etc)
and cheap.  This can end up mattering more than whether you have
published all the gerber files for your device.  Rather than focus on
Open Hardware, I have come to the conclusion that "generativity" is a
more accurate description of what we are after.  In our case
generativity means three things  1) being open "enough" 2) being
simple "enough" and 3) being affordable "enough".

Regards... Steve

Hi all,

In my personal case, I know some efforts to do the OCR with humans, due to
all the problems that all of you have already described ;-)

For the purpose of your problem: scanned images converted into PDFs, my
recommendation is to:

1.- Use an OCR software to create a first version of the scanned documents.
2.- Ask volunteers to improve the output of the OCR in a platform like
CrowdCrafting.org (take a look at PDF Transcribe app, it loads PDFs and you
can easily transcribe them).

There are several examples out there using a mix of the two previous steps.
For example:

1.- http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftranscribe/ Loads a PDF from a server,
and you ask the volunteer whatever you like: transcribe the figures, let me
know the structure of a table, etc. It is open source and can be used
directly in CrowdCrafting as it is powered by PyBossa (you need to host the
PDF files in a server with a simple configuration).
2.- http://www.oldweather.org/ This is a web tool from the Zoouniverse guys
who are transcribing docs thanks to the collaboration of hundreds of
volunteers ;-) I don't know if it is open source, but you can definitely
contact them.
3.- http://boinc.cs.uct.ac.za/transcribe_bushman/ This project is using the
BOSSA framework, the inspiration for PyBossa, for transcribing thanks to
volunteers really complex text from scanned images.
4.- https://www.zooniverse.org/project/ancientlives Similar to the Bushman
project, but with support from the Zooniverse team.
5.- Finally, http://www.pgdp.net/c/ a community of volunteers that actually
help to transcribe public domain books into electronic formats. I think
this is a great community and you can talk to them to get a bit more of
information about their techniques, solutions, etc.

There are probably more solutions out there, but these are the ones I know.
All of them have their pros and cons.

I can help you with PDF Transcribe solution, as I'm the developer of it, so
if you want to give it a try, let me know it.

All the best,

Daniel

Message-ID: <51C4236F.6020403@scinoptica.com>

Dear lists,


at the OAI8 conference in Geneva Daniel Beucke and I yesterday moderated 
a Breakout Group on AltMetrics. The discussion focused on steps to 
improve the acceptance of AltMetrics. We tried to record the results in 
a mindmap that you'll find under
http://www.scinoptica.com/pages/topics/mindmap-acceptance-of-altmetrics.php
or https://bubbl.us/?h=181824/2f1f72/15uRiisvqzWIo

Unfortunately we did not use an open tool to produce this map and it is 
not possible to edit the map for unregistered users. Nevertheless we 
would be very glad if you could give some feedback, via mail or twitter, 
our accounts are @dmetje (Daniel) or @scinoptica (me).

Best regards

Ulrich

 non-commercial 'data analysis' published for comment
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzstnEPtLp1Ufw+GoHAtxN9kivpqKfD6aDpfOMQFtL0UQ@mail.gmail.com>

The UK Intellectual Propert Office (IPO) has released some draft
legislation for technical review that may be of interest. It concerns new
allowances for:

1.) 'non-commercial data analysis' (which I would assume to specifically
include text mining and content mining).
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/techreview-data-analysis.pdf

2.) exceptions for education
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/techreview-education.pdf

3.) exceptions for research libraries and archives
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/techreview-research-library.pdf


The IPO welcomes answers to the questions posed in each document and any
specific drafting suggestions by 2 August 2013. Comments can be submitted
by email to copyrightconsultation at ipo.gov.uk

The IPO will also be holding a series of open meetings in the week
commencing 22 July 2013 to give an opportunity for discussion of the
drafts. Numbers will be limited so you are advised to book your place by
emailing copyrightconsultation at ipo.gov.uk.

Hello everyone,

At Faculty of 1000 we're looking for eight people - recently qualified life scientists or clinicians - in the London area to test some new features we're building for F1000Prime. We've developed a new algorithm to personalize the user experience of the website, which learns over time and sends users relevant papers automatically.

We also want to talk to scientists about a couple of new projects, tools for document authors and managing journal clubs. There will be two 2-hour sessions on 18th July with lunch provided. More information:

http://blog.f1000.com/2013/06/21/testing-new-features/

Let me know if you're interested.

Best,

Iain

Hi everyone,

I wanted to make sure everyone knows about SelectedPapers.net so that
people can volunteer for development and other activities. I'm not working
with them, but saw a blog post about this recently in my stream.

They would like to have a federated platform for reviewing and commenting

Thanks Ross,
This is very timely and useful from the IPO.
I think we should address the points in some detail and try to anticipate
possible problems.

I think possible areas not covered include:

* technological access to large amounts of material (i.e. the right to
crawl)
* the need to quote substantial parts of the work for scholarly purposes
(i.e faithful to the original text).
* the need to make annotated corpora available for reference (certainly at
the section level - e.g. the whole of "materials and methods").
* the right to extract information from diagrams and tables and other
e-media such as recordings.

I would not like to outline what we MAY do as this implies that anything
else is forbidden.

My internet is flaky for several days but will try to read/respond.

This is a VERY important area and I think the OKF should have a clear
compelling statement.

I agree with Christian.  The very broad statements by Bryan don't appear to
be supported by results reported by people on the tesseract mailing list.
 People who are training Tesseract are doing so to support new languages
like Ancient Greek or exotic fonts.  Tesseract supports 63 languages out of
the box including Chinese, Telugu, and a whole bunch of other non-European
languages.

So it sounds like they think counting words should be legislated
differently from plain old reading.

If they are scrupulous about enforcing the non-commercial aspect of this, I
don't see how it's really going to grant much, if any, new usage rights.
 Pretty much all research gets commercialized at some point -- well, unless
it's about Shakespeare or something.

Inspired by the thread, I made a collaborative text on software (and websites) for scientists:
http://titanpad.com/x1AgPmeWX1
Feel invited to add more! :)
(And supplement/modify the current ones.)

Especially ones that saved you time and nerve or are "I wish I had started using that earlier".
Adding some meta comments (e.g. links to blog post on using GitHub for science) are welcome as well.

And... least not least, you may discover something that will change your (scientific) life.

THEY have to do this as NC because they can do this without a new act - NC
would require parliament. So  it's valuable.

I don't see how it's really going to grant much, if any, new usage rights.

I think we can extract data and pulbish it with a CC0 licence and a
statement that an "The IPO adds an NC restriction". If IPO objects they can
tell us to stop. If the original licence holder wants to challenge this
then that's their problem...  Yes, messy, but a big start.

Hi All

I was recently involved in organising a conference in Oxford called 'Rigour
and Openness in 21st Century Science' ( http://rigourandopenness.com/)

The videos are now online with talks from plenty of familiar faces in open
science and open access and a broad range of topics - take a look at the
youtube channel if you have a chance.

http://www.youtube.com/user/RigourAndOpenness

They're all openly licensed so offer a great resource for introducing
people to aspects of open science and using in education or advocacy work -
we hope you find them useful!

Attendance is free, but we can accommodate a limited number of  guests and *
registration* (open up to August 1st) *is* *mandatory*.

There will be three sessions:

   - *The foundations of Open Science* will be concerned with the
   epistemological foundations of Open Science, with a focus on the Open Data
   principles and the impact of new technologies on the spread of scientific
   knowledge.
   - *Data sharing in the scientific practice: experiences from different

Thanks all for your ideas! The key thing is that the contributor doesn't
need to be maintaining their own calendar to make it really easy to add one
off events, in this case http://grical.org is definitely the closest we've
seen :)

Stefan (cc'd) is going to take a look again later in July so at that stage
we can see whether the google calendar route or going via GriCal will be
best. At first glance, GriCal would be preferable as both the software and
data is openly licensed and it has some nifty tagging/searching/geo
features. If you'd be interested in helping check out the card on the OKF
Trello board or email Stefan, all offers of assistance gratefully received!

Thanks very much again and we'll report back soon

Jenny
