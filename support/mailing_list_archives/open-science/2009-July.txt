Do you mean: is this an open science issue? Very much yes!

As usual, it seems the main sticking point is going to be sorting out
an agreed open license for the material ...

Last time I looked at the license situation on e.g. EoL seemed fairly
confusing with any one of main CC licenses (accepted) -- even though
some of these are mutually incompatible! More details on:

Yes, EoL has had some of the same problems as others in culture, 
thinking that CC licenses are internally compatible, which they of 
course are not. SA licenses from CC are only compatible with themselves, 
for example.

See "If I use a Creative Commons-licensed work to create a new work (ie 
a derivative work or adaptation), which Creative Commons license can I 
use for my new work?" on our FAQ and that we blogged at

Ah, the problem with the "commons" name :) If CC were named "Creative
License Choice" or the like I'd guess this would be less likely to
happen ;)

Hmmm.  "CLC"  -- I suppose if Garret Hardin had only written the "Tragedy of

we wouldn't be facing this definitional problem...?  8-]

Thanks for this Ben!

I've passed this on to our open-science, ok-london and general discussion lists!

	announcement
Message-ID: <4A55F96F.5010407@ed.ac.uk>

Apologies for cross-posting:

Beyond the Repository Fringe 2009 - Call for Participation

Place:                Informatics Forum, University of Edinburgh
Date:                30th/31st July 2009
Wiki:                 http://wiki.repositoryfringe.org/
Email:                rf09 at ed.ac.uk
Hashtag:           #RF09

Sponsored by JISC, the Beyond the Repository Fringe 2009 event will be
hosted by the  University of Edinburgh with support from the Digital
Curation Centre, the School of  Informatics, EDINA, and Information
Services, as well as UKOLN and EPrints.

This year the Repository Fringe organisers aim to draw on and showcase
a range of inspirational repository developments, including those 
produced from
the JISC Rapid Innovation and Repository and Preservation programmes, 
plus various
'barcamps', 'hackdays' and repository challenges.

Designed for an audience of developers, repository managers and
practitioners, the programme retains an 'unconference' feel to it, and 
seeks to canvass
contribution from a wide range of repository actors for:

-        Live demonstrations of innovative work;
-        "Pecha Kucha" presentations on any subject relating to
current, or future repository endeavours (i.e. a presenter shows 20
images for 20 seconds apiece, for a total time of 6 minutes, 40 seconds);
-        Round Table discussions;
-        Formal presentations or tutorials on related topics;
-        A 'Code Challenge'

Keynote speakers are Ben O'Steen, Sally Rumsey, and Clifford Lynch.
Jordan Hatcher will also present on the Open Database Licence (ODbL).
To accompany this event there will be a DCC Associates' Network
meeting (delegates will be able to join the network and participate on
the day) and a DISC-UK DataShare workshop on 'research data
requirements and digital repositories'.

The dates of the event coincide with the start of the Edinburgh
Festival season, which includes the Jazz and Blues Festival (31 July - 9 
Aug), the
Festival Fringe (7 Aug - 31 Aug), the Edinburgh International Festival 
(14 Aug - 6 Sept),
and the Edinburgh Book Festival (15 Aug - 31 Aug), as well as the usual 
impromptu street
theatre, musicians and sideshows.

Register for this free event and sign up for a 'performance' of your
choice at: http://beyondtherepositoryfringe-emailinvite.eventbrite.com/

University accommodation is available at pre-Festival prices on a 
first-come,
first-served basis.

on 0131 651 2007 or email them at bed.breakfast at ed.ac.uk.
