Hi All,

I'm just submitting an invited paper to the Journal of World Archaeology
as part a an 'open archaeology' theme. World archaeology is published by
Taylor and Francis. As the theme is about 'open' there's been some
discussion about the nature of the access licence. One thing I would like
is for the journal to allow text mining on this issue in perpetuity.

The editor has asked me for an exemplar license(s). I've googled but not
come across anything. Does anyone have a link to an exemplar licence they
can point me towards.

Many thanks

Ant

Thanks Mike and Ross,

Unfortunately Taylor and Francis are not going to go for any form of CC
licence.

The texts in this issues will be made available for 6 months and then
revert to T&Fs normal terms and conditions. What I want to do is to allow
text mining of the papers for at least that 6 month period and potentially
in perpetuity. Hence, I want/need some clause that specifically allows
text mining.

Best

The irony of this situation is not lost on any of us. Amazingly T&F can
not be shamed into doing the 'right thing'. However, in this instance the
need for the message for the community is as important as the
principles......

Not my call, but I can ask the theme editor.

For text-mining purposes this would make more sense - it's a good
proposal. Some journals currently operate like this e.g. The
Biological Bulletin http://www.biolbull.org/site/misc/about.xhtml

which is free (gratis) to access after 1 year.

Initial free (gratis) access, reverting to subscription access after a
given time, to me sounds like a purely promotional activity with no
real helpful research purpose, especially WRT text-mining.

Rockefellar University Press also has a propriety period and then opens up
the content.

RUP goes further than free/gratis: it makes the content available under a
CC-BY-SA-NC license.
Details<http://www.rupress.org/site/subscriptions/terms.xhtml>
.

Agreed that this approach is more valuable for text-mining than a 6 month
window of availability. I'd recommend this model... with CC-BY instead of
CC-BY-SA-NC :)

Sincerely,
Heather

Anthony, apologies, I lost track of the fact that you said T&F specifically
won't go for a CC license.

Then I'd suggest, off the cuff: anyone may analyze the content in any way
for any purpose, and redistribute excerpts and facts that result from such
analysis.

The principles here may also be of help?

The editor will take this up with T&F. My aim is for mining in perpetuity
and not the 6 month deal. But, I'm interested in seeing how they respond.

In respect of NC - I would never go anywhere near an NC licence. Segments
everything and not open. Much happier with a CC-BY :-)

Hi

On text-mining theme more generally: could someone please point me to
reliable examples of scientific progress made via text-mining of
open-access STM corpus?

The editor will take this up with T&F. My aim is for mining in
perpetuity
and not the 6 month deal. But, I'm interested in seeing how they
respond.

In respect of NC - I would never go anywhere near an NC licence.
Segments
everything and not open. Much happier with a CC-BY :-)

I appreciate this. However, two issues are at play:
1. a collection has potentially greater resonance with the community
2. 'open' is 'new' for the archaeological domain. So there is the
opportunity to get a message through to a mainstream audience (albeit a
pay-walled mainstream audience) and a lack of opportunity for alternative
publication mechanisms. Preaching to the choir does not change anything!

Most authors from the UK will follow the green Open Access model as
mandated by the UK Research Councils, so the text etc. will be available.

For these reasons I will go with this journal (subject to peer-review
etc.) as IMHO the benefits outweigh the costs. However, this has been an
interesting decision to make. Which is why I am interested in the response
from T&F.

Can we please try to keep threads reasonably focussed? This is a 
perfectly reasonable thing to be asking, but it should have its own thread.

Cheers,

I would distinguish at least:
* the legal ability to mine a collection of documents
* the legal ability to redistribute those documents (a) in original form
(b) annotated

modern high-quality textmining requires the open availability of a corpus
so that the techniques can be validated by the community. In general this
requires one or more of:
* access to CC-BY or CC0 material
* permission from a "rights-owner" or their representative to (a) min and
(b) redistribute the results.

There are very few cases where these apply:
* public domain material such as patents. We have extracted 500,000
reactions out of patents to very high quallity
* CC-BY publishers. IN practice this means BMC or PLoS. We have also mined
the abstracts and full-text of Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics since it
is Open Access CC-BY

I gave an invited lecture at LBM2011 last year and it was generally agreed
that the lack of materail allowed by the pubslihers was a major barrier to
modern text-mining. There are cases where the researchers have carried out
textmining without redictributed the annotated material because they are
not allowed to.

So my guess is fragmented studies in bioscience and a few other disciplines.

So there are relatively few useful examples because of the legal and
contractual restrictions. That does not mean there is no demand. Elsevier
has  granted only 20 permissions in five years. That is nowhere near enough
to be useful. I have no idea whether any of these allow open repubuication
of the results. If they don't I wouldn't call it useful science..

Thanks for the reply Peter. 

I was wondering specifically in relation to PLoS/BMC as text-mining proof of concept as surely that corpus is now sizeable enough to demonstrate usefulness and additional discovery. 

I hear much about people being able to carry around the PLoS corpus on a usb stick in their pocket, less to do with usefulness in relation to discovery.

Thanks again and best wishes

Andrew

Firstly the science has to be published in PLoS or BMC. There is virtually
no chemistry in either. So it's limited to those fields (though I have
started discussions on elementary particles with people who have some OA
material).

Secondly the scientific result has to be completely contained within that
corpus, else it cannot be published. Thus if Ross and I study phylogenetics
we have to believe that we can get enough out of BMC and PLoS alone.
Suppose we came up with a result and the referees said "There's a study in
Molecular Phylogenetics which doesn't agree with your findings".
Paper rejected. Or we have to measure every paper in MolPhy with a ruler
because we are forbidden - today - to mine it.

So the studies are limited to:
(A) technology. Ross and I are developing general methods
(B) proof of concept - where there is enough to show that there is enough
data to draw some conclusion. But that's very weak
(C) metadata and resources. I can probably get a list of hominids from BMC
without violating Elsevier's rules, because they are high interest and
there aren't huge numbers. That list might be of interest.

So what else did you expect? that if publishers forbid mining of 90% of the
literature that it's impossible to do good mining-based science.

Just don't use this as evidence that no-one wants content-mining as the
#commTollPub industry repeatedly does.

BMC and PloS cover 1.2% of the post-2000 PubMed content. BMC is mostly
very small journals. I wouldn't call this a "sizable" corpus. For my
application it was a nice as a little demo, but not more. (See
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21325301). Who cares if you write a
software that runs on 1.2% of all recently published papers?

Nevertheless, there are quite a few other papers that start to explore
running on this limited fulltext corpus. You could use the only one
comprehensive fulltext literature search engine to find them:
http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=pubmedcentral+text+mining&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&as_ylo=2011

People have mined cell lines, species names, locations, genes and
mutations in fulltext.

These are only the first steps. It takes a while to get text mining
algorithms to run on 100x longer text strings and import these from
weird formats (like PMCs or also Elsevier's Consyn XML).

With internet searching/mining, it's tricky to find a "proof of
concept" before the data is available. Your question is a little bit
like asking for a good "proof of concept" for Google before the WWW
was searchable. I at least would have never imagined stuff like Google
Scholar, Google Maps and Google Images back in 1994.

I don't think that academics can come up with any usable text mining
website for the average user. We'll have to wait for startups to jump
on this, I guess. Or the established text-mining companies.

I imagine that Roche, Pfizer etc have had concrete success with text
mining from closed-acccess content. Does anyone has a good link to a
big pharma textmining success story? (They do the PDF harvesting
against the terms of services of the publishers, though, so they might
not want to talk to openly about it too much)

cheers

Exactly right. I think it's slightly different with Ross's application.

Co-occurrence may be next. What species co-occur with what geomarkers in
the text. But that does not mean that you can easily draw conclusions.
Negation is a serious problem. "Penguins do not occur in Greenland".

That's the other thing. Every source has its own approach. If everyone used
NLM-DTD that could help. It's no use Elsevier offering me their particular
version of text - they are only one of 100 publishers.

Yes - but they will have their own agendas - and their own subdiscipines.
That means we have to consume what they give us. Elsevier tells us we can
use their APIs - whatever those are - but they aren't developed in respnse
to need or innovation.

Note that according to your colleague AW Elsevier have only allowed 20
instituions to text-mine over the last 5 years. That's about 1% of the
research active universities. How likely are we to get success stories from
that?

We've just launched the alpha version of PyBossa, a crowd-sourcing and
micro-taking platform developed in collaboration with the Citizen
Cyberscience Center <http://www.citizencyberscience.net/>.

In a nut-shell, PyBossa is a *free*, *open-source* *crowd-sourcing*
and *micro-tasking
platform*. It enables people to create and run projects that utilise online
assistance in performing tasks that require human cognition such as image
classification, transcription, geocoding and more. PyBossa is there to help
*researchers*, *civic hackers* and *developers* to create projects where
anyone around the world with some time, interest and an internet connection
can contribute.

The demo projects we currently have focus on real world applications of the
platform for use in medical diagnosis and geocoding the location of green
spaces in cities.

Looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks of it, so go and try out
the demo projects!

Sam

That's the old (no longer updated) repo, it's now at:

Our last outing to the Barbican saw a small but dedicated group working on
projects as diverse as services for open access policies, extracting
phylogenetic tree information from PDFs, storing crowdsourced data in CKAN
and more. This time we're going to be bigger and better with a dedicated
space which will hopefully be filled by YOU.

If you'd like to come along, please add yourself to the Etherpad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7 and if you have a specific idea
you'd like to work on, add that too and you'll have a couple of minutes at
the start of the hackday to tell everyone about it so we can link you up
with people who'd like to help.

You don't need to have an idea for anything to work on or even any coding
skills to join, there are plenty of opportunities to get stuck in with
other people's projects and many non-technical tasks, especially if you
like writing or design.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask and I look forward to
seeing many of you on 7 July!

Hi Jenny, can you please clarify the time?

The subject line states 17:30 UTC (i.e. 18:30 BST and 19:30 CEST), and
below, you are stating
*16:30* UTC/GMT (17:30 UK time), which would be 18:30 in Central Europe.

Message-ID: <20120611101006.M12371@w4w.net>


hi all,

this morning entered the following project for tomorrow's discussion to the pad

Maximow Award: results of blog comment + doi contest 10-31 May 2012 
http://maximowaward.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/blog-comment-contest-10-31-may-12-scientific-
terminology/ 15 comments.?
?? Q1: what to do next? any ideas on how to use these results for the advancement of open science??
?? Background details: In phase II of the Maximow Award 2011/2012 my team ran a blog comment contest 
that offered an individual doi for each comment (our rationale behind this: make the participants feel free to 
share their expert knowledge, their ideas and their arguments, use the blog software's automatic time 
stamp and technical citability). The doi became active as soon as the pdf of the comments (created manually, 
example: http://ctt-journal.com/index.php?id=783) were registered in the open repository of the OA Journal 
that hosts the contest, http://www.ctt-journal.com - if readers now search the doi, they are directed to the 
html page on the journal's website that shows the CC-BY-3.0 license as well as the recommended citation: 
"Please cite this contribution as follows", plus the link to the pdf download (many, alas, still ask for that).
? Q2: are you aware of any other project that has done any experiments in this direction? we would be 
interested in teaming up etc.

thanks & cheers
Claudia
Maximow Award 2011/2012 team member, a contest funded by the German Ministry of Science and 
Education within the frame of the German-Russian year of science, contest hosted by the medical OA journal 
"Cellular Therapy and Transplantation" http://www.ctt-journal.com - and after the quality check last year we 
recently overcame the technical hurdles, too, and will soon have CTT full text articles made available in 
PubMed via PMC - so there is some more food for mining et al.

Subject: [open-science] Data sharing policy for citizen science projects?
Message-ID: <CADfaFZriGr3Zcn48WbkEr-WsUH1vtjuqzy61GD+0HPh=TnxWyw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In genomics there are at least three slightly different approaches to
_rapid_ data sharing agreements: Ft. Lauderdale agreement, Batavia
Open Genomic Data License or simply release into public domain.
Agreements/policies/contracts other than PDD are made to either
protect data creators (most often) or prevent certain uses (rarely)
_before_ the data is already published/described in a manuscript/etc.
Once the paper is out, final version of the data is PD or OpenData.

Now, the question is whether there is any general
policy/agreement/contract on _rapid_ data sharing from citizen science
projects similar to the ones in genomics? Can we extend/modify Batavia
OGD License (which I like, as it encourages openness)? I feel that in
upcoming wave of citizen science projects rapid data sharing will
become a priority.

Best wishes
PS

It's a good point, except that such option isn't available everywhere
(the last time I checked, CC0 isn't compatible with Polish law, so we
don't have it ported here). But on the other hand CC0 defaults to
CC-BY in here, so probably one can use it in a culturally readable
sense...

Thanks

FWIW: according to http://figshare.com/faqs#q9
'figshare' defaults to (or requires even) CC0 for data sets
and CC-BY for everything else.

We say in Poland: where are two Poles, there are three opinions. So,
your example isn't actually the worst case scenario... But more
seriously: that's indeed an issue, and I feel there will be another
battle again non-commercial clause in case of citizen science
projects. Maybe there's a need for a set of initial principles about
such projects (YOURCITY Open Citizen Science Declaration anyone?), as
Panton Principles aren't that attractive for everyone.

In a data store where the contributors are not scientists, that is, they don't have any reward stemming from withholding data, the motivations and the definition of rapid would be different than in a data store made up of contributions from scientists who might want a withholding period. (I work on a project that is a collection made of contributions from scientists, so I have first hand experience with one such case).

Well, as far as I know FoldIt or most of @home projects don't share
data at all. On the other hand, there are projects where each
contribution is available in real time (Open Dinosaur Project for
example). And there are projects where people come with all sorts of
ideas how and when the data should be shared. Scientists leading
citizen science projects often don't have issues with releasing the
data once the paper is out. Contributors outside of academia often
don't care, as long as the progress is seen and goals achieved (see
FoldIt). But it can take few years till data release if projects are
of a size of typical grant (I'm talking about life sciences here). So
in essence, I'm looking for a tool that would encourage data release
before the publication in fields that don't have already such a
community agreement as genomics.

Thanks

That's true. But that is not a good _reason_ to choose Zero _here_,
don't you think? Anyway, I don't have anything against Zero, except
that I don't think it differs in practice that much from CC-BY. Both
are good enough for data sharing.

For many use cases yes but for data mining, aggregation,
meta analyses and the like it can become tricky to keep
track who to acknowledge for what.

Don't get me wrong. In many cases there are good reasons
for CC-BY and making data available in the first place is always
better than not doing it at all irrespective of the particular license.
It's just worth pointing out that there are differences and
what those differences are.

100% agreed. And my motivation behind original question is that I'm
trying to convince people to share data in a first place.

I am not sure if there is any such magic tool. Also, as in genomics, you might do better to try and create a mindset, a buy-in, an agreement, that is, redefine the "norm" if there is one, or to create a new norm if there isn't any in your field. It is, as you rightly indicated, a cultural problem. 

The tool(s) already exist -- you could convince the contributors to put their contributions in the PD, go CC0, use CC BY, heck, even store and transmit each contributor's preferred license with every query (yes, crazy messy to do, but that is what we are doing in one project I am involved with as that is the only way we can hope to bring together contributors spread around the globe). Oh, and we also have a "release by" date stamped on every contribution. Once again, all contributors agree to a max release by date, although they can choose to have a release by date that can be sooner than the default value.

It is a cultural problem, and a new or changed culture is required, not necessarily a tool.

I used the wrong word "tool" (I rather was thinking about "leverage"
or maybe even "example"), but nevertheless I think you are right -
mindset first, declaration later.

I'll come back to that question in a few months.

Thanks a lot

Hello everyone,

Another licence question. Our open science projects on The Synaptic Leap
are covered by a creative commons licence - currently a slightly
out-of-date CC-BY-2.5.

The open source drug discovery for malaria project (taking place on the
same site, but also elsewhere) is generically covered by CC-BY-3.0

http://openwetware.org/wiki/OSDDMalaria:GSK_Arylpyrrole_Series:Story_so_far

We need to deal with the various inconsistencies, and since we're writing
up the first paper on the malaria work we need to firm up the overall
licence. This brought up the following fact: I don't know whether we should
be Share Alike or not.

My feeling is that anyone should be able to use whatever we do, provided
there is attribution. To be honest our desire for attribution is mainly
about insisting on good practice - don't use something without quoting the
source. Partly it's about wanting to try to recruit more people to a
unified project.

However, there's a question about whether we ought to be insisting on Share
Alike. I need clarification on the following from knowledgeable people:

The Share Alike licence we'd use (
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/) includes the following
phrase: "If you alter, transform, or build upon this work, you may
distribute the resulting work only under the same or similar license to
this one"

The key word is "distribute", meaning that under the terms of that licence
it would be possible for a company to take the results from our malaria
work, internalise those results and use them to make money via a patent,
correct? Since that process does not involve "distributing" anything?

Is that correct? I am keen not to bar commercial spin-offs from our work. I
am keen to avoid licences that might make companies wary. Naturally those
spin-offs should not restrict what we are doing in any way.

By NOT using share-alike, are we exposing ourselves to some difficult
situation we've not predicted?

Cheers,

Mat

Hi Matt,

When you have a cc-BY-SA  the material may not be used in a patent since a
patent involves copyrighting and this is then different from what the
license requires.
On the other hand we (@ccess) have a strong preference for the CC-BY
atribution only license, this is the only "real" open access in our view.

Neither CC BY nor CC SA prohibit commercial use.  Only NC does that.  But NC also prevents commercial research entities from using the work at all since internal use might still qualify as commercial use.  

Copyright protects copying/distributing/amending copies of a work.  Patent protects making/using/selling an invention or discovery.  Different rights.

Most countries will not grant a patent if the application was filed after the invention or discovery has already been published, so your publication/distribution itself will extinguish any patent rights to the extent your paper discloses them.  Someone could add on to it and seek patent protection for the derived invention, but the addition has to qualify as being 'non-obvious'.

Attribution stacking is a serious problem for those who are trying to mine large collections of data.  It can be difficult to track small bits that are pulled out from different sources.  The list of authors to attribute might be longer than the article itself.  Consider using CC Zero or ODbL for your data.

To be honest our desire for attribution is mainly about insisting on good practice - don't use something without quoting the source.

Has anyone actually ever found attribution stacking to be a problem? I
hear it said quite frequently that this *could* be a problem but it
seems to be me there are fairly easy ways to deal with "attribution
stacking" so don't think this is really an issue (for more detail on
why see these comments from a few years ago:
<http://blog.okfn.org/2009/02/09/comments-on-the-science-commons-protocol-for-implementing-open-access-data/>).

Also, as a minor aside, I assume you meant the PDDL (Public Domain
Dedication and License) rather than the ODbL in this context (ODbL =
Attribution / Share-Alike for data).

Blush.  Yes, PDDL.

Not a miner myself, so hard for me to know whether it is a frequent or serious problem.  A good question that deserves more than mere assertion.

There are possible solutions but we don't have any consensus on whether they would be acceptable to authors.  As you suggest, one could throw all the citations into an attribution database -- whether or not data from any particular source was actually used -- and link to it from the resulting article/re-use.  But if the article is distributed/archived in hard copy version, authors may feel that this pushes them too far away from readers to get the recognition they would get if their name actually appeared in footnotes of the hard copy.   What if the link rots?  What if the final re-use only uses about 4% of all those cite-in-case-of-doubt sources?  Would that not be confusing to those who attempt to reproduce results? I don't know.  Not technically gifted enough.  

And the precise presentation of the citation could be more burdensome if, for example, the author requires any special format (as is possible with CC BY) or if all of the required citation elements are not easily obtainable.

I believe I've encountered problems with attribution stacking. Citations
that appear only in the supplement of journals are frequently not counted
in the major commercial citation metrics indices, and many journals limit
the number of citations.

For instance, I programmatically pull data from fishbase.org, which claims
that its content is cc-by-nc, and asks that I attribute authors of the
original paper in which the data was reported.  Since the queries need to
look at all the data to report the subset of numbers that match my query,
shouldn't I probably cite all 47,300 references and not just the hundreds
of sources that provide the final data?

Perhaps more importantly, I find the connection between an attribution
license and an academic citation confusing.  Isn't citation is a cultural
norm, not a legal requirement of copyright?  An attribution license
requires that I acknowledge the author in some unspecified way (i.e. it
isn't clear that I need to acknowledge them in a way that boosts their
citation count in ISI), if I share or remix and share their work.  When I
cite an academic paper, I am not sharing or remixing work.  I feel
uncomfortable with the use of an attribution license to "enforce" citation
practices.  If attribution doesn't equate to academic citation, then
perhaps the problem of "stacking" is more negligible.

On the other hand, if in using data from the repository I should attribute
both the repository and the original source, than the attribution stacking
problem introduced by copyright is a greater burden than the attribution
problem introduced by citation practices.  Is this any different than
citing a review or meta-analysis that determines "92 out of 120 studies
showed x" without citing the original articles?  When the goal of citation
was only reproducible research, there is no need to stack those citations
since it is easy to follow the chain.  But if the copyright license on the
data enforces citing all elements in the chain, then it is the terms of
copyright, not citation norms, which pose the greater burden of stacking.

Confused myself,

Attribution is legally mandated for re-use of copyrighted work in most  European jurisdictions under moral rights legislation.  If you are copying a substantial portion of another's work, you must identify that author.   I'm not well enough versed in Euro law to know whether attribution is required when insubstantial portions are used or if it is required when only database rights apply.  Would welcome instruction on those points.

Independently of the statutory law, repositories may require attribution/citation as a contractual condition of access and may specify the format for doing so.

Academic citation is different from attribution in many ways including that the authors credited in journal articles are often not 'authors' as the term is legally defined by copyright law.  A legal author is one who actually contributes to the actual writing of the article.  Also, the legal author may be the employer where the work was produced as part of job performance.  Citation may be the norm whether or not the subsequent user copies any of the original article, e.g., when the analysis produced in the original work contributes to the current user's thinking but quoting any of the specific language appearing in the original article.

Hi All

This may be of interest to anyone within easy travelling distance of
Oxford. There is also a programme for the rest of our 2012 meetings towards
the bottom of the page (this is subject to change!)

If anyone would like to set up a local Open Science group in their area,
please get in touch as we'd love to support you with web infrastructure,
publicity and contacts wherever we can.

Best wishes

Jenny

Hi All Just a reminder about next week's discussion, I hope many of you can
make it along with your ideas for how scholarly publishing should look
going forward! Things are changing in the UK with the recent publication of
the FInch Report and RCUK draft Open Access policy, but besides access
we'll be discussing peer review models, publishing platforms, what counts
as a publication and many more topics of direct relevance to researchers
putting out papers.

I look forward to seeing you there and encourage you to spread the word to
any colleagues or friends who might be interested!

Best wishes

Jenny

Message-ID: <87k3yzfcxf.fsf@pobox.com>


Just wanted to ensure I correctly understand how DOIs are handled by
figshare and the DataHub. IIUC,

1 figshare generates DOIs for uploaded datasets, per

http://figshare.com/blog/All%20research%20outputs%20should%20be%20citable/32

2 datahub allows appending external DOIs to a dataset's metadata, per

http://blog.okfn.org/2012/06/19/ckan-science/

  but does not create DOIs for the user.

Is that correct?

Hi All

Just a reminder that the next Open Science hackday will be taking place in
a couple of weeks and it would be great to see some of you in person or
online! Please sign up as soon as you can for numbers and so we can see
what interesting projects people are interested in working on.

When: Saturday 7 July 2012, 1000-1700 UTC+1
Where: Centre for Creative Collaboration (
http://www.creativecollaboration.org.uk/ ), London
OR
OKFN IRC channel (#okfn on irc.oftc.net and full details of how to connect
(including via a web browser) can be found at: http://okfn.org/contact/)

Sign up: http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7

Our last outing to the Barbican saw a small but dedicated group working on
projects as diverse as services for open access policies, extracting
phylogenetic tree information from PDFs, storing crowdsourced data in CKAN
and more. This time we're going to be bigger and better with a dedicated
space which will hopefully be filled by YOU.

If you'd like to come along, please add yourself to the Etherpad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7 and if you have a specific idea
you'd like to work on, add that too and you'll have a couple of minutes at
the start of the hackday to tell everyone about it so we can link you up
with people who'd like to help.

You don't need to have an idea for anything to work on or even any coding
skills to join, there are plenty of opportunities to get stuck in with
other people's projects and many non-technical tasks, especially if you
like writing or design.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask and I look forward to
seeing many of you on 7 July!

Jenny

That's correct at the present. The DataHub is in negotiation with a
DataCite DOI provider for several months to be able to supply DOIs but
the process has been a little slow as the DataHub does not fit it
seems with the normal experience of "repositories".

Regards,

Rufus

	Foundation
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzLdkWBPYzhXDUPCDmD=7rDvd88uZb=4sgLyDk=apU6cg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I gave a talk at a palaeontology conference in Cambridge recently; May 24th 2012
introducing the Open Knowledge Foundation to young academics.

I was thinking this recording might be of interest and/or use for
further outreach.

The audio recording of this is now available to listen to on the
internet via SoundCloud.

Huge credit to the organisers (http://www.palaeocast.com/) who
recorded it with such clarity.


The audio here is:
http://progpal2012.tumblr.com/post/26077977142/ross-mounce-the-open-knowledge-foundation-the
and corresponding Prezi slides here:
http://prezi.com/w0d29prhs-nd/the-open-knowledge-foundation/
(almost entirely recycling/repurposing slides from Rufus Pollock &
Simone Aliprandi, with attribution and links given)


Comments / feedback very welcome - this was my first time introducing
the OKF to a new audience.


Best,

Ross (in California atm)
