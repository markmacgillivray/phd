Hi all. (Cc-ing REA Brasil mainling list, Wikimedia Brasil and OKFN Brasil)

Well, as fas as I understood, these educational contents will have the
non commertial (NC) restriction. I must tell politically it is a good
progress if the bill is sanctioned, since this is a bill for the
reachest state of Brazil, but it would be awesome without this
restriction. This bill was put forward by people like Carolina Rossini
and Bianca Santana, my friends who lead open educational resources
initiatives in Brazil (see here <http://rea.net.br/>).

I congrat them for the good efforts put to this happen and I am unsure
to sign it, even being my friends, so comments are very welcome. In
S?o Paulo city, the richest in South America, they have created a
similar law for the educational content produced with public money,
but again with the NC restriction. Small cities around S?o Paulo has
already been using this content for their schools, if I remember some
news I read a while ago. And this is *really* good.

My feeling sometimes is that people fear to suggest to remove the NC
restriction when advocating a more open license, even when dealing
with public money (does the State fear people to start their own
business and improve the local economy? :/) I think we should not fear
this and we need to argue why NC is closed, why NC is bad. As an
example, once it was pretty easy to convince a person working in the
secretary of education of Rio de Janeiro - I went trying to partner
with them using Wikimedia hat. When I told this person their content
could not be used on Wikimedia projects because of the NC restriction,
he decided to change, it was the easiest conversation ever  (see here
<http://www.educopedia.com.br/> - some contents were still with the
NC, but the main page changed and I hope the new content as well).

I wonder if we have a law that doesn't allow commertial, but is less
restricted than the traditional all rights reserved, will be more
difficult change. I don't think so. So we should consider our position
in this case, a very important one in Latin America.

Best,

Tom

I have never used all of Web of Knowledge's features. IIRC, it has
lots of citations and references that they get by scraping journal
indexes. What else does it do? anything else?

Peter +1, this competition is particularly relevant for their Data Citation
Index - http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/multidisciplinary/dci/
i.e. picking people's brains on how to create a system which sounds really
awesome and important, but would be behind a paywall.

Is there an open source library (possibly using tesseract+opencv or gnu
gift) that can help with extracting metadata from journal articles, or
bibliographic items? I would rather look at something that already exists
instead of writing it on my own (something I see myself doing eventually).

It's already a pretty hard problem working from PDFs without adding the
noise from OCR as well.

For PDFs there's TeamBeam which claims to be AGPL 3, but the source
repository is password protected:

Bryan,

Could you elaborate a bit?  What kind of information do you have to base
the query on, and what data do you want to get out?

You might find Greycite (http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org/) useful
(through its API, I think source-code is also available).  The CrossRef API
is pretty useful: http://api.labs.crossref.org/, particularly if you
already have the DOIs.  A good number of publishers have their own API for
all their data (PLoS: http://api.plos.org/) or at least the metadata
(Nature: http://developers.nature.com/docs/read/APIs), and most publishers
follow the Google Scholar/highwire convention for html metadata
http://scholar.google.com/intl/en-US/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing, which
any open source html/xml parser could help extract.  Sorry if this is old
news and you have something more elaborate in mind.

Cheers

Yes  - this is what we are doing with PDF2SVG. It's not that hard to do the
example given.

And let's use MathML for the analysis. It's open.

Distinguish between born-digital docs ("PDFs") and scanned documents. The
former - which are almost universal since ca 2003 are much easier.

If you have these then we can reconstruct the information using the Open
PDF2SVG (http://bitbucket.org/petermr/pdf2svg). This is being developed to
extract paragraphs, metadata, etc. (SVGPlus). the third phase is to extract
chemistry, maths, etc. I show a chemical example in
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2013/02/03/announce-we-ami-can-now-extract-semantic-information-from-scientific-pdfs/where
we extract a spectrum. Maths will be analogous.

Any volunteers would be very valuable. You don't have to be able to be a
Java programmer because some of the challenge is hacking Fonts... and the
disciplines. It's about to take off - join in.

Hi, Carol.

Is the federal bill also going to have the NC commertial restriction?
We should talk to Paulo Teixeira as soon as possible to explain to him
why this is bad. Why this will limit the use of this content produce
by public money. And we can tell he can do better than S?o Paulo
state. We can mention places, such as California (S.B.1052), that are
producing educational content with an open license. We can mention
every single example of public policies that made it in the right way.
Is this hurry really needed? Won't we have more problems to convince
later to remove the NC restriction?

I think it will be a big mistake if we have all the laws (S?o Paulo
city, S?o Paulo state and the federal government) using a *closed*
license, as if it is open, that transmits a wrong message to people
that are not aware of these apparently details, but that can become
important in the mid or long term.

That is one of the roots why people of the digital world always think
wrongly that just using a Creative Commons license is enough and we
all know this is a very common mistake. It is not enough and I am
really not sure if we will benefit if all these public policies in one
of the most important economies of the world do not send the right
message about the subject we all work for, a more open world.

But many in the academic community and among the politicians in Brazil fear the public content will be "privatized" after released as OER. I explained tons of time all the issues around this.... We even did a huge FAQ also with comments and explaining why we think NC is not the best choice...see www.rea.net.br/faq

So, there is a preference - in the sao paulo city decree, the state bill and the federal bill, for for cc--by-nc-Sa (one of the most restrictive licenses of the CC spectrum), but folks CAN chose institutionally to chose less restrictive licenses.

**
     Today's Topic: *ACM Council Endorses New Publishing Policy*

Tuesday, February 5, 2013
------------------------------

ACM's resolve to offer more free access pathways to its respected
publications archive will enter a new realm in the coming months with the
endorsement of a publishing policy that expands author rights and provides
greater levels of flexibility in regard to open access.

The policy changes, approved by ACM Council last October, are in response
to the expressed needs of authors, researchers, and ACM members for more
free access to the content of ACM journals and conference proceedings in
the ACM Digital Library and other online venues.

The new policy enables open access to the most current proceedings volume
of each ACM Special Interest Group conference at the discretion of the
sponsoring SIGs. The free access is available at the SIG or conference web
site.

And SIGs will have the option to make the proceedings from their
conferences freely available via the ACM DL platform for up to two weeks
before the event and for a total period of one month. Not only will this
option facilitate easy access to the proceedings by conference attendees,
it will also enable the community at large to experience the excitement of
learning about the latest developments being presented in the period
surrounding the event itself.

Changes also include new options for authors to manage the publication
rights to their work. Authors who prefer to retain copyright of their work
may choose to sign an equivalent licensing agreement with ACM. Authors who
wish to retain all rights to their work can exercise an author-pays option,
which allows for perpetual open access to their work. Authors who prefer to
have ACM manage the rights and permissions associated with their work may
continue using the traditional ACM Copyright Transfer Agreement.

Under both ACM's copyright transfer agreement and the new license, authors
have the rights of:

   - Exclusive ownership of patents and trademarks
   - Reuse of any portion of the work without fee or need for permission in
   future work
   - Major revisions and creation of derivative works wholly owned by author
   - Freely posted author-prepared Accepted Versions in personal
   bibliographies and on their own institutions' repositories

How about removing those pesky watermarks from pdfs? Sometimes they
completely obfuscate the contents of a paper we're trying to read, or
sometimes they have more sinister purposes.

Working proof of concept:

https://github.com/kanzure/pdfparanoia
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdfparanoia

Discussion history:
https://groups.google.com/group/science-liberation-front/t/c68964cf55d8f6fa

To get source code:

git clone git://github.com/kanzure/pdfparanoia.git

To install:

sudo pip install pdfparanoia

or:

sudo easy_install pdfparanoia

Right now there's IEEE and AIP support. I need more samples to work with.

It should also remove the side annotations about which library the PDF was
downloaded from. Send me one and I'll see.

Of course if it's encrypted or DRM'ed there isn't much it can do

Is there a svg2pdf? The problem with using pdfquery is that it can only
generate an xml format, and at first it looks like pdfxml, except Adobe
came up with a "standard" called pdfxml that looks completely different. So
getting things back into pdf seems to be difficult.

I use Apache FOP.  We should be able to:
* read PDF into SVG
* remove the rubbish
* write the primitives back into PDF. We might get font problems so you may
have to make do with PDF/ISO standard 14 fonts. That might screw some of
the microkerning occasionally. If you want to reformat running text and
lose the publishers layout (e.g. 2-col => 1-col then we will use SVGPlus.

Some of this is alpha, not production.

Hi All

If anyone has an open science project they would like to talk about at the
London based OpenTech event, take a look at the instructions below.
The call specifically mentions 'Building on Science and Communication'.

There's already at least one in operation - http://www.petridish.org/
which says "Petridish lets you fund promising research projects and
join
first hand in new discoveries.

   - World famous researchers post projects and expeditions that need your
   help to get off the ground.
   - Each project has a minimum threshold it must hit in pledges, or it
   will not be funded.
   - Backers in successful projects join the team and get insider rewards
   such as:
      - Early access to news about progress and findings, souvenirs from
      the field, acknowledgements in journals, naming rights for new
discoveries,
      or the ability to join an expedition in person."


Best regards,

Laura

I signed up in order to try to create a project, but it was not possible.

There's also:

SciFund http://scifundchallenge.org/ (hosted by the RocketHub site rather
than a science-only platform but it's probably the most recognised science
crowdfunding drive)

Microryza https://www.microryza.com/ (from the site: Microryza is an online
platform that lets you discover new research, support the research you
think is important, and then connect with scientists. In return, you
receive updates directly from the researchers to get a window into how they
work and see your impact in the process of discovery.)

Open Science Space - would you like to introduce your plans over at
http://www.opensciencespace.com/? It looks like you're planning to launch a
new science crowdfunding site, how do you foresee this area developing as
more platforms come into existence?

Speak of the devil... this just came out over on O'Reilly:

Crowdfunding science
Micro-patronage could let researchers step around funding obstacles.
http://radar.oreilly.com/2013/02/crowdfunding-science.html

Nice overview of the various players in the field. Sounds like
someone's been listening in on this email thread...

This is the sort of thing where we cannot let the infrastructure of the
browser be determined by the whim of corporations. Anything we can do?

I have an impossible dream about the people owning the browser. It used to
happen with lynx and mosaic. Can we buuild an open science browser?

Subject: Help get math turned back on in Chrome
To: "www-math at w3.org" <www-math at w3.org>


Chrome 24 had MathML in it.  But they plan to turn it off in Chrome 25!!!

http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=152430#c32

says

 Note that MathML has had to be turned off because the code is not
> yet production ready. We hope to turn it on in some future release.

This is because of a minor layout bug for which a fix has already been
submitted.  Apparently the folks at google don't care about math much and
just want to see it die -- the support that is in there was done by someone
who volunteered his time for a year and finally had to go back to doing
paid work.

One easy step to show your support for math in Chrome is to go to the above
link and click on the star in the above left and to get everyone else you
know to do the same.  That says you care about this bug being fixed.

A harder step is to find a way to get google to wake up to the reality that
math is used in the classroom everyday and is one of the three "r"s (as the
saying goes in the US). Not supporting it is a disservice to education
around the world and to science, math, and engineering in general. So blog
about Chrome's killing math support, tweet about, or create the next viral
video about it.

If you care about math support in browsers, do something to show you care!

Peter, Neil,

Thanks for sharing; this is indeed sad news.

Um, the google-code link is not working for me. (500 error).
Is there a blog-post or such about this we could share the link to? (aside
from the archived thread,
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2013-February/002140.html)

Not directly related, but my (somewhat dated) experience with MathML was
that webkit rendering wasn't really satisfactory for anything beyond very
basic equations, so I've stuck to mathjax rendering meanwhile.  Obviously
there'd be some advantage to having my xhtml source-code in MathML instead,
but I've been reluctant to do this without adequate rendering.  Sorry for
the tangent and perhaps I could tap the expertise here for any thoughts on
this?

Chrome 24 had MathML in it.  But they plan to turn it off in Chrome 25!!!

says



Note that MathML has had to be turned off because the code is not
yet production ready. We hope to turn it on in some future release.
We plan to announce this in the Chrome 25 release notes.




This is because of a minor layout bug for which a fix has already been
submitted.  Apparently the folks at google don't care about math much and
just want to see it die -- the support that is in there was done by someone
who volunteered his time for a year and finally had to go back to doing paid
work.


One easy step to show your support for math in Chrome is to go to the above
link and click on the star in the above left and to get everyone else you
know to do the same.  That says you care about this bug being fixed.


A harder step is to find a way to get google to wake up to the reality that
math is used in the classroom everyday and is one of the three "r"s (as the
saying goes in the US). Not supporting it is a disservice to education
around the world and to science, math, and engineering in general. So blog
about Chrome's killing math support, tweet about, or create the next viral
video about it.


If you care about math support in browsers, do something to show you care!

So to put this in a little bit of real world perspective, Chrome 24, the
first with any MathML support, has been out less than a month, so it's not
like there are millions of people using it for MathML on a daily basis.
 For a less dramatic overview of the state of MathML support in browsers
see Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML#Web_browsers  A chart
colorcoded by version is here: http://caniuse.com/mathml

Sure.  There are tons of open source browsers that people can contribute
to.  Chromium is another, the WebKit core rendering engine that it depends
on is also open source.  If the development team isn't merging your patches
fast enough, you can do your own private builds and distribution.

Or just switch to a different browser.  Firefox has supported MathML for
many versions.

If you dream about an open browser, use Firefox instead. It has been supporting MathML for a long time:
http://caniuse.com/mathml

While I mostly use Chrome, ocassionally I turn back to Firefox. For example I did it for MathML support for my notes in gitit.

I hope Stefan doesn't mind me posting about this event here, I thought it
might help advertise

OKF Austria (@OKFNat on Twitter if you're interested in following) are
holding an Open Science event later this month in Vienna from 18:00 on
February 25th.  Further details here:
http://okfn.at/2013/02/07/open-science-grundungstreffen/

Open Research (in it's more broader sense, not just science) is going to be
one of the main themes of focus this year for OKF and we're really growing
fast in this area. Alongside Austria, I believe OKF Finland are also
looking to grow a local open science group.

I look forward to hearing a summary later of what happened at this event :)

Best,

Ross

 submitted to BIS 'open access inquiry'
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzFzehMt-i7EUQZsdajiBynZpFBj5WgFe7ttWLDmh-uew@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,


Just a reminder that today is the final day that one can submit written
evidence to the BIS 'open access inquiry'
Further details here:
http://science.okfn.org/2013/01/30/yet-another-open-access-inquiry/

Anyone, from anywhere in the world can submit written evidence as long as
it addresses the points of the inquiry

The Committee will consider a range of topics including:


   - The Government?s acceptance of the recommendations of the Finch Group
   Report ?Accessibility, sustainability, excellence: how to expand access to
   research publications?, including its preference for the ?gold? over the
   ?green? open access model;
   - Rights of use and re-use in relation to open access research
   publications, including the implications of Creative Commons ?CC-BY?
   licences;
   - The costs of article processing charges (APCs) and the implications
   for research funding and for the taxpayer; and
   - The level of ?gold? open access uptake in the rest of the world versus
   the UK, and the ability of UK higher education institutions to remain
   competitive.

Written evidence should be sent to the Committee, as an MS Word document,
by e-mail to biscommem at parliament.uk.

I am hoping Richard Smith will be submitting some expert evidence
http://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/category/richard-smith/ among others.

	research
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzEdH2G209rZ22pqULv0Cq-kABpMWj1nb31w=xDzvAtDg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

sorry for all the announcements today. A lot is happening at the moment.

Not everyone may realise this but the Open Knowledge Foundation is hugely
influential:

1.) On Monday we were in Brussels at the *Licences For Europe meeting*,
actively participating in the first Text & Data Mining working group
meeting (#Licences4Europe on Twitter). It was largely disappointing that
the discussion was framed at the outset to exclude discussion of the type
of copyright reform many pro-access groups in the room wanted. We hope this
situation will have changed by the next working group meeting. It was
accurately described here:
https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130204/12241621879/eu-commission-wants-more-copyright-licensing-not-creative-commons-fair-use.shtml

2.) When journalists need quotes from people who know about the state of
open knowledge, we're an excellent organisation to ask!
In the latest edition of Nature I am quoted, representing Open Knowledge
Foundation on the subject of Creative Commons licencing of academic
research:
http://www.nature.com/news/researchers-opt-to-limit-uses-of-open-access-publications-1.12384

The very definition of open access (
http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/openaccess/read)
states that *anyone* must be able to re-use research *without legal barriers
*. Thus NC & ND modules of Creative Commons licences if applied do not make
that research open access, and they can significantly hinder some re-uses
like textmining.
See Joris Pekel's excellent post on some of the problems of NC for more:
http://blog.okfn.org/2013/01/08/consequences-risks-and-side-effects-of-the-license-module-non-commercial-use-only-2/



Ross

PS I will try and write some of this up in a prettier blogpost on the
science.okfn blog soon.

Hi to all,

in addition to the action That Ross Mounce indicated for the house of

up.
The EU is deciding on the Horizon 2020 budget as of today and as part of
this will decide on the details of science and innovation programme. We
need to stress the importance of Open Access and open science to the
Council.

Jep, that's me :)

Already got some interesting feedback and questions for our
invitation. Is it strictly open source only?
Should everything (raw data, publication) be re-useable, and
re-distributable?

Is there any official position about this from the OKFN? I know panton
principles, but barely know something about open source. I' quite
shure the open definition also means reusability and
redistributalbility for the papers too.

And another question: Is OER and also an issue in open science, or is
this better placed somewhere else?

I mean, for me personally all this questions are no issue, I'm going
the free/open way, but for a group/organisation, it's a little bit
hard for me to make a point.

Even here at the Open Knowledge Foundation we live in the real-world.
Although we definitely see the benefit and virtues of openly-licensed open
source software, many of us use macs or windows computers (not me actually
Lubuntu & Ubuntu are my OS's).
Thus open source is preferred but certainly things like Dropbox are
absolutely indispensable programs to many people I know (myself included).

If you can, yes. This is what we stand for. But again, we live in a
complicated real-world. Most scientists myself included don't often get to
write papers alone, we collaborate. Not all our collaborators may be happy
doing science the open way. Those collaborators may be in a position of
power over us, perhaps they are our supervisor? One can try to be open, but
if we don't attain 100% perfection in that respect it is no shame.

The official OKF line is that all branches and areas of OKF should
abide/follow the open defintion as you correctly point out:
http://opendefinition.org/

CC0 , CC BY and CC BY-SA are compliant open licences.

CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-SA and CC BY-NC-ND are not open licences - they clearly
exclude some users and some usages (e.g. commercial usage).

My fellow OKF Panton Fellow Sophie Kershaw has an excellent video that
explains the Panton Principles for open data in science. Perhaps it might
be worth showing at your meeting to help explain what open data in science
is about?
http://youtu.be/JmN7gTGkJwA


And another question: Is OER and also an issue in open science, or is

OER (Open Educational Resources) are a closely related issue to open
science, but OER is not necessarily restricted to just science. It could be
an OER about performing arts for instance.

PLOS has recently published an OER textbook for science
called Translational Bioinformatics. This is pretty cool.
http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2013/01/23/lets-make-those-book-chapters-open-too/

If used in undergraduate studies, students wouldn't need to buy expensive
textbooks any more - I certainly remember paying for some expensive ones
myself when I was an undergraduate student!

Great. Just don't be too militant on imposing open values on others. If
people open up there science just a little bit, that's still much better
than being 100% closed.

Many of us hear believe that open science is the future. One day what we
call open science, will just be called science. That's our goal :)

Best,


Ross

Dear Steve;

Misha Agrist has a paper in Nature on the subject of genetic privacy.
Probably you already know Misha Agrist, I believe you might find his work
useful and interesting.

Subject: [open-science] Cost of Knowledge update,
	Elsevier boycott one year on
Message-ID: <CABaSBazXLWpCuX--ybUf44Jq1wuRDFz=RKQZ-9nVb_qQ_e1e-w@mail.gmail.com>

The Elsevier boycott one year on
http://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/the-elsevier-boycott-one-year-on/

"""
A few days ago was the anniversary of the beginning of the Cost of
Knowledge boycott of Elsevier. It seems a good moment to take stock of what
the boycott has achieved and to think about what progress has or hasn?t
been made since it started. This post is a short joint statement by many of
the people who signed the original Cost of Knowledge statement last year.
At some point in the not too distant future I plan to write a longer post
giving a more personal view.

The Elsevier boycott: where do we now stand?

In the first few months after the boycott started, the number of
signatories grew very rapidly. The growth is now much slower, but this was
to be expected: given that, for understandable reasons, no editorial boards
of Elsevier journals were ready to take the drastic step of leaving
Elsevier, it was inevitable that further progress would depend on the
creation of new publication models, which takes time and work, much of it
not in the public eye. We are very pleasantly surprised by how much
progress of this kind there has already been, with the setting up of Forum
of Mathematics, a major new open-access journal, and the recent
announcement of the Episciences Project, a new platform for overlay
journals. We are also pleased by the rapid progress made by the wider Open
Access movement over the last year.

In one respect the boycott has been an unqualified success: it has helped
to raise awareness of the concerns we have about academic publishing. This,
we believe, will make it easier for new publishing initiatives to succeed,
and we strongly encourage further experimentation. We believe that
commercial publishers could in principle play a valuable role in the future
of mathematical publishing, but we would prefer to see publishers as
?service providers?: that is, mathematicians would control journals,
publishers would provide services that mathematicians deemed necessary, and
prices would be kept competitive since mathematicians would have the option
of obtaining these services elsewhere.

We welcome the moves that Elsevier made last year in the months that
followed the start of the boycott: the dropping of support for the Research
Works Act, the fact that back issues for many journals have now been made
available, a clear statement that authors can post preprints on the arXiv
that take into account comments by referees, and some small price
reductions. However, the fundamental problems remain. Elsevier still has a
stranglehold over many of our libraries as a result of Big Deals (a.k.a.
bundling) and this continues to do real damage, such as forcing them to
cancel subscriptions to more independent journals and to reduce their
spending on books. There has also been no improvement in transparency: it
as hard as ever to know what libraries are paying for Big Deals. We
therefore plan to continue boycotting Elsevier and encourage others to do
the same.

The problem of expensive subscriptions will not be solved until more
libraries are prepared to cancel subscriptions and Big Deals. To be an
effective negotiating tactic this requires support from the community: we
must indicate that we would be willing to put up with cancelling overly
expensive subscriptions. The more papers are made freely available online
(e.g., through the arXiv), the easier that will be. Many already are, and
we regard it as a moral duty for mathematicians to make their papers
available when publishers allow it. Unfortunately, since mathematics papers
are bundled together with papers in other subjects, real progress on costs
will depend on coordinated action by mathematicians and scientists, many of
whom have very different publication practices. However, a statement by
mathematicians that they would not be unduly inconvenienced by the
cancelling of expensive subscriptions would be a powerful one.

We are well aware that the problems mentioned above are not confined to
Elsevier. We believe that the boycott has been more successful as a result
of focusing attention on Elsevier, but the problem is a wider one, and many
of us privately try to avoid the other big commercial publishers. We
realize that this is not easy for all researchers. When there are more
alternatives available, it will become easier: we encourage people to
support new ventures if they are in a position do so without undue risk to
their careers.

We acknowledge that there are differing opinions about what an ideal
publishing system would be like. In particular, the issue of article
processing charges is a divisive one: some mathematicians are strongly
opposed to them, while others think that there is no realistic alternative.
We do not take a collective position on this, but we would point out that
the debate is by no means confined to mathematicians: it has been going on
in the Open Access community for many years. We note also that the
advantages and disadvantages of article processing charges depend very much
on the policies that journals have towards fee waivers: we strongly believe
that editorial decisions should be independent of an author?s access to
appropriate funds, and that fee-waiver policies should be designed to
ensure this.

To summarize, we believe that the boycott has been a success and should be
continued. Further success will take time and effort, but there are simple
steps that we can all take: making our papers freely available, and
supporting new and better publication models when they are set up.

[Forwarding from Cynthia Hodgson at NISO, via Peter Suber and SPARC OA
Forum.]****

** **

*NISO Launches New Initiative to Develop Standard for Open Access Metadata
and Indicators*

** **

*Interested participants from all library types, publishers, and funding
agencies are encouraged to contact NISO*

** **

February 7, 2013 ? Baltimore, MD ? The National Information Standards
Organization (NISO) voting members have approved a new project to develop
standardized bibliographic metadata and visual indicators to describe the
accessibility of journal articles as well as potentially describe how
?open? the item is. Many offerings are available from publishers under the
banner of *Open Access (OA)*, *Increased Access*, *Public Access*, or other
descriptions; the terms offered vary between publishers and, in some cases,
based on the funding organization of the author. Adding to the potential
confusion, a number of publishers also offer hybrid options in which some
articles are ?open? while the rest of the journal?s content are available
only by subscription or license. No standardized bibliographic metadata
currently provides information on whether a specific article is freely
readable and what re-use rights might be available to readers. Visual
indicators or icons indicating the openness of an article are inconsistent
in both design and use across publishers or even across journals from the
same publisher.****

** **

?The NISO OA metadata and indicator project would complement other related
efforts currently underway,? states Nettie Lagace, NISO?s Associate
Director for Programs. ?Such projects include CrossMark, CrossRef?s update
identification service; *How Open Is It?*, a guide developed by PLoS,
SPARC, and OASPA; Vocabularies for OA (V40A), a JISC/UKOLN project;
ONIX-PL, a specification for communicating licensing terms developed by
EDItEUR; the Linked Content Coalition; and NISO?s Open Discovery
Initiative. Coordination and communication with these projects will be an
important aspect of the NISO working group?s efforts.?****

** **

?The benefits of having standardized OA metadata and indicators should have
a positive impact on many participants in the scholarly communications
chain,? explains Todd Carpenter, NISO?s Executive Director. ?Funders who
have implemented OA mandates would have a mechanism to determine if a
specific article or researcher is compliant with their policies. Publishers
of hybrid journals would benefit by having a simple mechanism for signaling
the OA status of the articles published under that model. Authors could
more easily determine whether their selected distribution option is being
respected and be able to document their compliance with funder
requirements. Readers could more easily ascertain from search results if
they can read an article for free or fee?and more easily adhere to the
terms that publishers have established. Aggregators and discovery service
providers would have an improved mechanism of programmatically collecting
and surfacing OA articles that are available in the community.?****

** **

The project launched by NISO will focus initially on metadata elements that
describe the readership rights associated with an OA article. Specifically,
the NISO Working Group will determine the optimal mechanisms to describe
and transmit the right, if any, an arbitrary user has to access a specific
article from any internet connection point. Recommendations will include a
means for distribution and aggregation of this metadata in machine-readable
form. The group will also consider the feasibility of incorporating
information on re-use rights and the feasibility of reaching agreement on
transmission of that data.****

** **

Individuals interested in participating in this working group should
contact Nettie Lagace (nlagace at niso.org). An interest group list for this
project will be available for those who would like to receive updates on
the Working Group's progress and provide feedback to the group on its work.

Done!

I've listed the sites and what I could find out about who they are, how
they review projects and what commission they charge.

If anything is wrong or you think of another one to add, just let me know
or put it in the comments section.

Hi All

Join in an open science course sprint for Open Data Day on 23rd February!

Open Science Course Sprint: An Education Hackathon for Open Data Day An
Education Sprint

The future of Open is a dynamic landscape, ripe with opportunities to
increase civic engagement, literacy, and innovation. Towards this
goal, the Science
Program <http://creativecommons.org/science> at Creative Commons is teaming
up with theOpen Knowledge Foundation <http://okfn.org/> and members of the
Open Science Community to facilitate the building of an open online course,
an Introduction to Open Science. The actual build will take place during a
hackathon-style ?sprint? event on Open Data Day  <http://opendataday.org/>on
Saturday, February 23rd and will serve as a launch course for the School of
Open <http://schoolofopen.org/> during Open Education
Week<http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/36266> (Mar
11-15).

Want to help us build this?

The course will be open in it?s entirety, the building process and content
all available to be worked on, all to help people learn aboutOpen
Scienc<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science>e.
Do you know a thing or two about Open
Access<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access>?
Are you a researcher who?s practicing Open
Research<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_research>?
Do you have experience in instructional or visual design? This is an
all-hands event and will be facilitated by representatives at CC, OKFN, and
others in the Community. Open Science enthusiasts in the Bay Area are
invited to the CC Headquarters in Mountain View for the live event. Remote
participants will also be able to join and contribute online via Google
Hangout.

The day will begin with coffee, refreshments and a check-in call with
other Open
Data Day Hackathons <http://wiki.opendataday.org/2013/City_Events> happening
around the globe. The Open Science Community is strengthened by shared
interests and connections between people, which we hope will grow stronger
through networked events on Open Data Day. The Open Science course sprint
at CC HQ will build upon open educational content, facilitate the design of
challenges for exploration, and provide easy entry for learners into
concepts of Open Access, Open Research, andOpen
Data<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data>.
It will be done in a similar fashion to other ?sprint-style?
content-creation events <http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/34550>,
with lunch and refreshments provided for in-person participants. We?re
literally going to be hacking on education. Sound like something you?d be
interested in?
Join us.

For details about the ways you can participate, see the Eventbrite
pagehere<http://www.opensciencecoursesprint.eventbrite.com/>.
To see the draft (lightly framed) course site on Peer to Peer University,
go here <https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/>. For
information about other Open Data Day events, see the events wiki
here<http://wiki.opendataday.org/>
.

Developers

We need you, too! Basic skills for working with open datasets is important,
and can be difficult to grasp. Who better to develop great lessons about
working with data than you? Similarly, for those interested in building
upon apps and projects from other Open Data Events, updated source code and
repository information will be posted to a public feed (for now, follow
hashtags #ODHD13 <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ODHD13>
and#opendataday<https://twitter.com/search?q=%23opendataday> on
Twitter.

For other information, contact billy dot meinke at creative commons dot org
or @billymeinke <http://twitter.com/billymeinke>.

This event is being organized by the Science
Program<http://creativecommons.org/science> at
Creative Commons with support from the Open Knowledge
Foundation<http://okfn.org/> and
members of the Open Science Community.

I thought I would share a couple of other resources that may be of interest.

Privacy Tools for Sharing Research Data
http://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/

Practices and Tools for Microdata Anonymisation from the International
Household Survey Network
http://www.ihsn.org/home/node/118

After reading the likes of Paul Ohm, Latanya Sweeney, Helen Nissenbaum,
Arvind Narayanan and others, I now find myself struck by just how absent
the issue of privacy appears to be in the Open Data world.  It's a bit like
a movement promoting exercise without providing any guidance on how to
exercise safely.

It does make me wonder whether the Open Data/Science community is not
putting itself in a vulnerable position by not addressing privacy in the
context of Open Data advocacy more proactively.

Message-ID: <CABPM+wr_M_48sXenmT9tFyCV97TB0AMKZVAdSjvRn7zuiQxkhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

We unsuccessfully applied to run some open science sessions at Euroscience
Open Forum 2012 so it would be good to try again for 2014 in Copenhagen!

The themes are:

   - The Healthy Society
   - A Revolution of the Mind
   - Global Resource Management
   - Learning in the 21st Century
   - Green Economy
   - Material and Virtual World
   - Urbanization, Design and Liveability
   - Science, Democracy & Citizenship

More info: http://esof2014.org/calls-for-proposals

Does anyone have any open science related projects or ideas for scientific
sessions within these fields? It would be great to get some representation
at what is a huge (and usually very fun) conference.

Jenny

I've forwarded this to lists. I am on the EU list. Ross Mounce attended in
stead of me on Feb4. I am away on the March date. These meetings are very
important I think, though perhaps Jonathan and Ross could advise. It looks
a lot of commitment.

My apologies for being silent the last few months. I am in the middle
of writing a second phase EU grant call proposal, involving a lot of
Open Science, and must give that priority (for my career's sake),
unfortunately. As much as I would be vocally more involved in the Open
Science WG activities, it's a bit hard to do so at the moment.

Pete also presented at Startup Science 2012,

http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/startup-science-2012/pete-binfield-peerj/

"""

PeerJ Pete Binfield

I we can set a goal, to sequence the human genome for $99, then why not the
same for academic publishing? It just launched this week and we are
fortunate to hear the inside scoop of a very ambitious new model.

We launched on Tuesday. The people behind it are myself, the one journal to
rule the world was justm entioned and I used to run PLOS One, and it
actually is the one journal to rule the world. It's going to publish about
3% this year, about 25,000 articles. I left four weeks ago to do this. My
co-founder is Jason from Mendeley. He left back in December. We've been
working on this for about 6 months. It was originally his concept.

So uh. I thought I'd give you a quick overview about what academic
publishing. Not everyone is knee-deep. This is our original pitch deck to
VCs. Academic researchers have an obligation to publish in order to advance
their careers. The scholarly journal market is dominated by subscription
publishers that charge thousands of dollars for an annual subscription, and
you have to hand over the copyright and content to the publishers. So it's
artificially restricted. That's a $10 billion/year industry and highly
profitable. It's subsidized by the free labor of the academics that write
for free, they review for free and so on.

The interesting development in thelast 10 years has been open access whih
is about 10 years old now. It wants to distribute content freely without
restrictions, like with Creative Commons. The model is that the author pays
and the author pays the processing charge. Thsi is typically in the range
of $1300-$5000 per article they publish. This pays publication costs.

What is open access? In the journal world it's a distribution model, not a
business model. The author pays thing is not the concept of open access.
Open access is usually licensed under CC. The broadest definitino is CC-BY
3.0. Although some publishers try to add a NC term to it. This is the gold
standard of open access licensing to appyl. If you apply that license, your
content can be reused, remixed and redistributed for free provided that you
acknowledge the original service.

Commercial products and applications can be built on top of OA content,
provided that you have not applied the NC subterm. Anyone can repackage and
sell it off. We want to encourage more of that because it hasn't been
happening in the OA world. OA is rapidly disrupting the established
subscription model.

OA honestly improves accelerates and facilitates academic progress. It's a
good thing in the world and the world deserves its academic content to be
published like that, how can you build a business model like this and how d
oyou persuade the world? OA is disruptive. This is a recentp aper that is
trying to predict the disruption curve of OA. It's about 15% of the world'
scontent right now. This study predicts that by 2017 that about 50% of all
scholarly articles will be OA. By 2019 it might be 90%. They did this by
extrapolating the Christenson disruption curve. The speed of which.. has
been growing.. PLOS One has been dubling in size, 3% this month but next
month might be 5%. If you roll that out over OA in general, I wouldn't be
surprised that within 5 or 8 years that we will have complete disruption of
the publishing industry.

This is the curve for PLOS One through the end of 2011. It's publishing a
pheneomonal amount, about 2k articles/month and that's growing each month.

So what is PeerJ? We are a new OA publisher, we are publisher of an
academic journal that looks a lot like PLOS ONe. It's PeerJ. We have a
preprint server called PeerJ Preprint, and teh two work together. Authors
can submit to the preprint server, or others can submit directly to the
jounral. The two are tightly integrated. The most interesting thing is
that.. I mentioned that the standard business model is that authors pay for
publishing each time, and that payment of $1300-$5000.. we are shifting
that model so that you don't pay to publicize, you pay to become a member
of PeerJ, you subscribe and by being a member you get lifetime rights to
publish future papers with us for free. It's a very different psychological
motivator.

How do you incentivze peer review? There are some innovations there as
well. In order to remain a member in good standing, you must review once
per year, it can be a peer review, it can be a comment on an article. We
want to encourage the community to contribute to the community. The end
result is that everything is OA under a CC license.

I thought that this would be interesting, this is straight off of our
website. These are the guiding principles that we are building PeerJ from.
We are an innovative company that serves the academic community that
attetmps to drive costs down. Literally we believe that we are going to
take the best features of traditional publishing worlds, all the
traditional benefits around archiving, peer review, versions of records, we
are going to marry that up to modern internet technology to improve that
process. We are a service industry for academia. WE serve academia and not
the other way around. THis is what's needed to get the company off the
ground. We want the prices to get down and lower.

What are the prices? We launched on Tuesday, if you become a basic member,
that's $99 and that's a lifetime right to publish one paper a year with the
journal. That remains to be seen. I think, we're pretty confident. Enhanced
is $199 and that's 2 papers/year. The $300 is the right to publish an
unlimited number of papers per year. You can upgrade at any point, the
catch is that all contributory authors have to be a member. Each of the
authors on the paper have to be a member in good standing. So all their
future papers are free. There is also this requirement to do a review every
year per member.

Some of the interesting things is that all of our content is CC-BY. We will
make a sfotware platform for peer review, we have Public APIs, we are going
to open source a bunch of our stuff, and it will be a cultur eof
innovation. Anyone that wants to build tools to interoperate with
ourselves, we'd love to talk with you. We launched on Tuesday, and this is
the great reception we got. We got great media coverage, we lined up
interviews in Science Magazine, Times Magazine, Nature, we got started with
an overwhelmigly positive response. There are some doubters coming out of
the woodworks but in general everyone has been very positive.

The award for the best headline is that: New OA Journal Lets Scientists
Publish Until They Perish. That's PeerJ. Thank you.

So about oA in general? What can we do to promote it? When I talk about the
startup science community, everyone loves OA. But when I talk with people
in the academic community, I get shoulder shrugging because they don't
understand what the world is missing out on. We have to engage the academic
community and they are the oens doing editing and writing. How can we
actually get the academic community to understand the importance of this
movement?

There are many reasons for why the academics aren't embracing OA. One of
the ways that this community in this room could help to accelerate this
movement. The OA community believes that OA content is better, that it is
going to improve the dissemination of the content, that it will facilitate
faster discoveries.. the problem so far is that we haven't proven that
point, we haven't built killer apps or groundbreaking discoveries based on
OA content. There have been some smallish examples but nothing
earth-shattering. Perhaps that is because we are only getting 15% of the
content. But some killer app that took OA content and made it much more
valuable to the world and much better, then academics would see why they
should publish in OA in the first place.

I have a bunch of questions, but to save time, I'll pick one. One thing
that I am curious about is do you have a ranking system, a way to filter
out, I'm not goign to say that there's going to be drivvel, I think the
accountability system will deincentivize that.. clearly I have a certain
set of keywords I want. Is there a filtering system to bring the relevant
and most credible papers, the papers with the hgihest reviews post
publication?

Yes, there is. We won't necessarily have a proprietary secret sauce
algorithm, but we will use something else. The metrics movement is
attempting to solve this problem for us. They are coming up with
alternative metrics around who tweeted about it, who wrote about it, etc.
We are going to be building that into the system, expect to see the
metrics, to see what filters out good and bad or what's relevant, etc.

First of all, thank you. This is a really great model. I'm not sure what it
looks like as a business, but as a service it seems really awesome. I
appreciate it. I like how it incentives longevity, so that's pretty great.
So what does it look like as a business? How many new grad students every
year?

There are 10M publishing academics. The way it breaks up is that there's
25k journals that publish 1.5M articles per year in academia. STM is about
1M articles per year. They are being published by about 10M practicing
academics worldwide. So the audience is possibly 10M and lots of grad
students come in and out, and that's hard to find out. I would say about
500k come in each year, and 500k drop out each year, it's about that order
of magnitude.

There is some secondary other alternatives around this. Down the line there
would be advertising on the site, yes. But the primary business model is
the subscription or membership.

Is there any worry or thought about making sure that the people are who
they say they are on their system? Is that a problem? Do you think it
matters? Like author identifiation, not having more than one account or
something.

Every member who is going to do anything significant will be a publishing
author of some sort. There are industry requirements, like the Requirements
for Authorship, you have to contribute to the paper, you have to be cited,
yo uhave to verify that you are happy to be a coauthor on the paper. We
will also be using unique author identifiers, as an industry initiative
called Orchid, they will have their beta in September, and that's an
industry-wide adopted initiative to give every academic a unique identifier
and to track their progress centrally.

One of these problems is that it's a walled-garden where you create an
artificial garden, a wall, the price point to enter the system. Walled
gardens are very similar to the way in which previous journals and their
peer reviewed networks have become stalled in their time. The advantage of
one that doesn't have a walled garden which doesn't have such an initial
requirement, like the pervious gentleman's discussion, is that it allows
for more chaos, but which is why you need stronger means of authenticating
individuals, like the previous gentleman at the mic suggested. How do you
avoid with your walled garden approach at PeerJ, running into the same
problem with peer review where it calcifies again where it becomes
non-transparent because the incentives to maintain the walled garden, where
it becomes difficult to penetrate the .. for judging the way they do?

So potentially, I might have misunderstood.. allr eviewers on the paper do
not need to be members of the company as it were. Peer review will be
sourced from anywhere. It will not be members only reviewing on members.
The peer review will be independent. They can find peer reviewers from
anywhere in the world.

It's still a walled garden because the people who invite the peer reviewers
can have an agreement with thsoe one. Here's the same issue.. it doesn't
matter if it's interactive or this what you're trying to build.. there's an
incentivize or revenue incentive to make it less transparent because
embarrassment to really cover it up.

We are going to be encouraging open peer review, and we want people to
publically provide their names. The authors will give the option to publish
the whole peer review history. So they will be able to publish their peer
review comments as well. Those will be published along side the paper to
make it more transparent. But it's an option.

With an open system, you have to have all of the leemnts open to have it
work. If you have hidden systems, then that selectively biases the outcome
or the appearance of each.. I'm trying to illuminate this with the
difference between closed/open systems.. .t his is a delimma in how we
maintain the authentic nature of feedback mechanism. That is how the
scientists trusts the nature o their quality o their peer review. It gets
back to the problem.

I think we are more open than the typical journal. Most of those peer
reviews are never published. It's a problem with academia in general.

Did you say you had a proprietary model of rating the journals? Yes, we
have a custom software system for peer review. Why is that internal
proprietary system? We want to open source it, we will open source a lot of
our software, but we're not sure how much will be open soruce. We have to
buidl it for our own purposes, so that we can control the process to build
it out the doors, down the line it's potentially open source sure.

Pretend that this is the last century.. is the mechanism that you are
building is also going to be a publication for Thomas Edison, Gregor Mendel
or citizen scientists? Perhaps not Edison... but sure, you don't have to be
credentialed to publish papers. PLOS One will publish high school student
papers and undergrads, as long as it deserves to be published, so yeah. But
what about the peer reviewers? We will definitely be enforcing some
standards.

Based upon your expeeriences iwth PLOS One, there are many textual searches
instead of human curration to determine biological entwroks/ Are there any
kind of comparison study that has been done on using only open source or
open access literature, as the basis for definition versus the traditional
sources? It would be interesting to see teh quality metric.

There is an expert on this. Hedler in the corner is an expert in data
mining and published papers. I think part of the issue is that the
proportion of OA literature is always including some closed access stuff.
Hedler will know whether there are some studies like that.

So, as a scientist, I know that, frequently people pubilsh and cross the
line of very low impact work because they can't publish it anywhere else.
How are you going to balance the reputation, like.. is it your goal to make
this a high impact journal?

No, it's meant to be very PLOS One like. It will accept anything that is
acceptable and deserves to join the literature. It can be papers about
failures. PLOS One is not a dumping ground for the bad stuff.. it's about
everything. It's not ust about the impact factor. But the average impact
factor is greatr than 90% of the journals in the world already. On average
the content is not awful. It's actually just fine. They found that 75% of
all authors went to PLOS One as their first choice. It wasn't down the
chain of their rejections. We want the world to decide what was good
enough, what was useful, etc.

What about cross genetics, higher impact session, and have tiered version
or something?

It's just the one journal to contain everything. Within that one journal,
maybe we can say here's the bestof in genetics, in comp bio, we'll be able
to do that with just a display mechanism. We don't intend to have separate
branded journals that papers get dumped into. No.

This is a very interesting model. To be clear, are the quoted prices a
one-off payment rather than an annual fee? And if a member doesn't keep up
their reviewing, can they regain good standing just by doing a review, or
will they pay to join again?

On the other hand, I wonder if the requirement for every author to be a
member will be an obstacle in fields where papers can have dozens of
authors. If, say, 20 authors on a paper needed to become members, both the
cost and the extra admin (if it needs 20 separate payments) would be less
attractive than an article publication charge.

Thanks,
Thomas

They cover a lot of those questions on their
website<https://peerj.com/about/FAQ/>.
Yes, it's a one-time payment, but you do need to submit at least one
"review" per year, very broadly interpreted ("an informal comment on a
submission to *PeerJ PrePrints*; a formally requested peer-review of a
paper submitted to *PeerJ*; or an informal comment on a published paper").
And for papers with more than 12 authors, only 12 need to be paying members.

Hi all,

as said, I am really busy, but one thing that requires not too much
work, would be an somewhat informal meeting in Eindhoven (NL) with
Seats2Meet... they have free fridays where we get a room from 2-4 for
free, and a free drink afterwards (shared with the rest of the S2M)...

Is there interest in this?

Hi Egon,

Perhaps it might be worth starting an OKFN meetup for Eindhoven (and
surround) and you could add details regarding an informal open science
meetup?

http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/

We'd be happy to help push this out via social media and to the OKFN-NL
list:

I'm going to be in San Francisco, but I wonder if it might be worth doing a
piece from the Science Working Group on the main OKFN blog explaining why
this matters, what the opportunity here is and saying what we hope would
happen (and - more or less explicitly - what we hope will not happen)?

processes, tools and other areas that researchers need to consider to make
their research data openly available.

*Whom for? *Researchers interested in carrying out their work in more open
ways, experts on sharing research and research data, writers and copy
editors, Web developers and designers to help present the handbook online,
Anyone else interested in taking part in an intense and collaborative
weekend of action.
Please register at the Eventbrite
page<http://openresearchdata.eventbrite.com/>if you intend to come.
And visit the online participation hub for further
details: http://bit.ly/odrhandbook.

Hi everyone,

I am new to this list but have been a member of the School of Data for a
few months.  I was chatting with Lucy at OKFN and she suggested these items
might be of interest to this list.

Last week, NIAID held their annual Bioinformatics and Computational
Biosciences Festival on the topic of Data Science: Unlocking the Power of
Big Data.
https://respond.niaid.nih.gov/conferences/bioinformatics2013/Pages/default.aspx

The complete video archive is available at
http://videocast.nih.gov/launch.asp?17798 .  Kirk Borne from George Mason
University and Rick Stevens from Argonne National Laboratory we both
particularly good.

Also, the Health Datapalooza early bird registration is closing March 3.
 This is a conference about using open government data for entrepreneurial
endeavors and the public good.  Registration is at
http://healthdatapalooza.eventbrite.com/#

And just in case this list did not know, Fred Trotter submitted a Freedom
of Information Act to CMS for Medicare data and turned it into an open
research data set on doctor referral practices in the US.

Jenny,

Seems like it would be good to have an open science session. Under the
headings provided, one obvious one might be the importance of openness in
the development of new medicines. This could encompass what I'm doing and
schemes on public involvement in discovery (i.e. crowdsourcing initiatives)
which can highlight the dissolving of the bridge between the researcher and
the patient, through to new developments on the open availability of
clinical trial data. Lots of generic open issues to talk about, but it
seems like health could be a focus? Anyone on this list interested?

Cheers,

Mat

I'd support this. Mat is obviously the leader and it depends to quite an
extent on him. One approach might be to collect others in Europe. Maybe
OpenPhacts though it's a different style from us, we might involve the EBI
with CheMBL, etc.

Hi Mat

This sounds like a good plan! If anyone would be interested in helping to
plan such a session (particularly those located in Europe, but we're not
excluding anyone) please reply to the list and let us know, we can then
split out smaller planning groups to make a proposal and feed back to the
list.

Another thought was a session as part of Learning in the 21st Century
covering graduate (and undergraduate) training for 21st Century Science,
particularly digital research/big data/open science. We could cover
initiatives like Sophie's Open Science Training Initiative
http://opensciencetraining.com/ and School of Data http://schoolofdata.org/.

Again, shout if you're keen! If you're new to the working group/this
mailing list and would like to get stuck in or learn more about an area of
open science then this would be a great way to start, all that is required
is interest and enthusiasm!

Deadline is 9 May so we have plenty of time to formulate ideas but it would
be good to get started :)

Jenny

Thanks Steve

I think partially it is not addressed as much as it might be by open
science advocates because privacy is a domain specific issue and the
majority of data from the natural sciences doesn't have this problem (I
think that's a true statement, if you consider
physics+chemistry+maths+non-human bioscience and every other science that
doesn't involve people). Obviously, social sciences and clinical sciences
often will.

There has needed to be a general, high level push for open data in science
which required a simple message and now as the idea becomes more widespread
I think we'll see a lot more consideration of the nuances of publishing
data in the fields where privacy concerns apply. However, I personally feel
we still have a lot more work to do at the broader brush stroke 'scientific
community' level.

We don't ignore the issue. For instance, the working group response to the
Royal Society Science as a Public Enterprise consultation was explicit in
acknowledging that not everything can and should be made open:
http://science.okfn.org/2012/07/10/working-group-response-to-royal-society-science-as-a-public-enterprise/
"We acknowledge that there are reasons why outputs should not be released
but these are restricted to a small set of issues including but not
necessarily limited to personal privacy, personal endangerment, risks to
the research itself, danger to the environment. All of these are much
larger issues which deserve consideration."

Which was reflected in the final report by the Royal Society's use of the
term 'intelligent openness' and their own discussion of privacy issues
http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/

However, perhaps we should be proactively targeting scientific communities
who have this greater barrier to sharing research data, or even better
encouraging more members of those communities themselves to encourage
discussion and explore and build tools to make it possible. Many
researchers are now considering how to be as open as posible without
violating privacy, as in the Privacy Tools for Sharing Research Data
project http://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/ to which you linked and we
should be following and promoting more of that work.

I don't think the open data/science community is making itself vulnerable
at this stage, but I can see that constantly hammering home a simple and
absolute message about how science should be done could be alienating to
those researchers who have even more problems to overcome in opening up
data, if indeed they can, than those in fields who don't use personal data
(and even then we acknowledge that making this stuff open and reuseable is
not easy by any stretch of the imagination!)

*U.S. Representatives Introduce Bill Expanding Access to*
*Federally Funded Research*
* *
*Washington, DC ? February 14, 2013* ? U.S. Representatives Mike Doyle
(D-PA), Kevin Yoder (R-KS), and Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) today introduced
legislation to increase the openness, transparency, and accessibility of
publicly funded research results.

The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR) would
require federal agencies with annual extramural research budgets of $100
million or more to provide the public with online access to research
manuscripts stemming from funded research no later than six months after
publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

*"This bill will give the American people greater access to the important
scientific research results they?ve paid for,?** *Congressman Doyle said
today*.?Supporting greater collaboration among researchers in the sciences
will accelerate scientific innovation and discovery, while giving the
public a greater return on their scientific investment.?*
* *
*?The scientific research community benefits when they are able to share
important research and cooperate across scientific fields. Likewise,
taxpayers should not be required to pay twice for federally-funded
research,? *said Congressman Yoder.* **?This legislation is common sense,
and promotes more transparency, accountability, and cooperation within the
scientific research community."*
* *
*"Everyday American taxpayer dollars are supporting researchers and
scientists hard at work, when this information is shared, it can be used as
a building block for future discoveries,"* said Representative
Lofgren.  *"Greater
public access can accelerate breakthroughs, where  robust collaborative
research can lead to faster commercialization and immense benefits for the
public and our economy."*
* *
Specifically, the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act would:

?         Require federal departments and agencies with an annual
extramural research budget of $100 million or more, whether funded totally
or partially by a government department or agency, to submit an electronic
copy of the final manuscript that has been accepted for publication in a
peer-reviewed journal.
?         Ensure that the manuscript is preserved in a stable digital
repository maintained by that agency or in another suitable repository that
permits free public access, interoperability, and long-term preservation.
?         Require that each taxpayer-funded manuscript be made available to
the public online and without cost, no later than six months after the
article has been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
?         Require agencies to examine whether introducing open licensing
options for research papers they make publicly available as a result of the
public access policy would promote productive reuse and computational
analysis of those research papers.

An identical Senate counterpart of this legislation is also being
introduced today by Senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Ron Wyden (D-OR).

*?FASTR represents a giant step forward in making sure that the crucial
information contained in these articles can be freely accessed **and fully
used by all members of the public**,? *said Heather Joseph, Executive
Director of the Scholarly Publishing Academic Research Coalition (SPARC). *?It
has the potential to truly revolutionize the scientific research process."*

This legislation would unlock unclassified research funded by agencies like
the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, the Department
of Defense, the Department of Education, the Department of Energy, the
Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland
Security, the Department of Transportation, the Environmental Protection
Agency, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National
Endowment for the Humanities, and the National Science Foundation.

The bill builds on the success of the first U.S. mandate for public access
to the published results of publicly funded research at the National
Institutes of Health (NIH).  In 2008, the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) implemented their public access policy.  It is estimated that
approximately 80,000 papers are published each year from NIH funds.

The Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act echoes the interest
in public access policies expressed by the White House Office of Science
and Technology Policy, which has examined the mechanisms that would
leverage federal investments in scientific research and increase access to
information that promises to stimulate scientific and technological
innovation and competitiveness.

Well, I am still pondering about doing this in Maastricht, as at least
we have one research group (the one I am in) that is involved in Open
Source...

It seems rather to raise interest with people... :(

That is an interesting initiative. Maybe we could do something similar.
Worth seeing the proposals to this research award.

Hi all,

Wikim?dia France, a non-profit organization supporting Wikimedia projects
in France, launched a few months ago an international research award aiming
to reward the most influential research work on Wikimedia projects and free
knowledge. After the initial submission of research papers by the wikimedia
community, our jury
members<http://researchaward.wikimedia.fr/en/page-d-exemple/>have
selected among a thirty
proposals<http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikimedia_France_Research_Award/papers_submission>,
five finalists.

It's now up to you to choose the most influential. For that, please visit
this page :
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Research:Wikimedia_France_Research_Award/nominated_papersand
vote. Deadline for vote is early March. The announcement of the winner
is scheduled to end of March.

If you have any questions, please use the project talk page, thanks !

Hi Jenny,

Thanks for your thoughtful reply and for the very useful additional
resources.  I should preface my remarks by saying these are emerging
thoughts on my part as I participate with a development research funding
organisation in thinking through what Open Data means to them.

I fully take your point about the "hard" sciences, if that isn't already
too loaded an adjective.  There is obviously plenty of research that
doesn't trigger privacy concerns.  However, if I have learned anything in
my recent investigation, it is that the boundaries are fuzzier than I
imagined.  The kind of differential diagnosis process that privacy
researchers use to infer new information from disparate data sources is
both remarkable and disturbing at the same time.  These surprising
inferences are going to happen more often and in more unexpected ways as
more data is made available online.  And that is the great thing about Open
Data and part of the rationale for advocating for it, to encourage exactly
that kind of serendipity.  It is a two-edged sword though whether we are
talking about research data or government data. The surprising nature of
these inferences does raise the question for me as to whether we ought to
be asking the privacy question whenever we ask the open data question, even
if it is only to dismiss it in obvious cases.   For natural reasons, I
think the problem seems more or less serious depending whether you come
from the physical or the social sciences.  Treating privacy as a special
case or domain specific would require a clearer understanding of privacy in
the networked world than I think currently exists.

Let me emphasise that these are not fully formed opinions on my part but
just what my inadequate investigations have led me to so far.  Happy to be
disabused of my concerns.

Regards... Steve

As a start, Paul Ohm's "Broken Promises of Privacy" does a great job of
illustrating the problem through a number of different examples.

Hello, I am new, but I saw that this topic is about Bio Medical, I'd
just like to say that I am interested in biology, and hope to one day
do research in synthetic biology or regenerative medicine from stem
cells.

I appreciate any advice or ways in achieving this goal.

Thanks,

Hi Bryan,



There is a paid version of LabArchives if users want more storage but
there's no obligation to use it, and datasets published and assigned
DOIs through the platform (free and paid) are available in perpetuity.
There is also no obligation for BMC authors to use LabArchives. But if
they do want to use it they will get an enhanced free product as part of
this partnership.



Hopefully the footnotes to and the full blog entry
<http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/labarchives_and_
biomed_central_a>  explain the situation.



Best,



Iain



"...

Permanence, citation and linking of datasets
In 2011 LabArchives introduced the ability to assign digital object
identifiers
<http://blog.labarchives.com/2011/04/19/labarchives-and-dois/>  (DOIs)
to datasets stored and shared with the software. DOIs facilitate data
citation, discovery and earning of academic credit for data publication,
and datasets assigned DOIs through LabArchives will remain available in
perpetuity. The DOI system is used by journal and data publishers, such
as DataCite members <http://datacite.org/members> , to ensure online
permanence of published articles. DOIs are indexed permanently by the
International DOI Foundation and are much more favorable than URLs for
permanently linking content online.

DOIs are assigned in LabArchives through the 'DOI Management' tab in the
software's share settings (pictured). DOIs should only be assigned in
instances in which data are to be permanently shared with the public.

A LabArchives user can choose to share a data set as it exists at the
time of publication, or they may enable users to continue to view
changes as they are made, while, importantly, maintaining the version
which supports a peer-reviewed publication. So, a DOI can be assigned to
data as of the time the article was published and authors or re-users of
the data may then continue with their research.



...

Footnotes

Use of LabArchives' software will have no influence on the editorial
decision to accept or reject a manuscript, and use of LabArchives or
similar data publishing services does not replace preexisting community
data deposition requirements set out in individual journals'
instructions for authors.

The full version of LabArchives including 100GB of storage requires
payment <http://www.labarchives.com/pricing.php> . BioMed Central does
not receive any commission from LabArchives.

BioMed Central remains committed to work with all data repositories
which enable linking of data to publications particularly where specific
journals and communities endorse them - such as for example the Dryad
repository <http://datadryad.org/> , with which we are working towards
submission system integration with BMC Ecology and BMC Evolutionary
Biology. More information on data deposition requirements relevant to
BioMed Central's journals can be found on our supporting data resources
page <http://www.biomedcentral.com/about/supportingdata> ."

Can you elaborate on whether or not there is a non-free version of
LabArchives, and what the implications of this are? It looks like this
might be more proprietary lock-in? Just checking.

I wrote about this over a year ago in response to PMR's comment about 
risks of open data and re-identification, but it didn't get any notice here.

http://del-fi.org/post/15573839201/open-data-is-not-your-new-bicycle

Recent issues in genomics, open data, and identifiability here:

http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321.abstract (paywall, sorry)
http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/275 (paywalled, sorry, but 
companion policy piece to the above)

And of course three classic cases where open data breaks privacy:

https://freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/paul/netflixs-impending-still-avoidable-multi-million-dollar-privacy-blunder/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_leak
http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2009/09/your-secrets-live-online-in-databases-of-ruin/

Open data is going to make us more identifiable because data makes us 
more identifiable, and the more there is of it, the more identifiable we 
become. We should acknowledge that head-on and design for it.

The technologies for de-identification and anonymization are nowhere 
near as strong as the technologies that break them - banking on 
technology and licenses to enforce privacy is like banking on digital 
rights management and click-throughs to enforce copyright...

Here's an example from 2008. The NIH had to block public access to two
previously open medical datasets because researchers had figured out how to
use independent data to de-anonymize the two datasets and identify
individual patients.

Subject: [open-science] Privacy is only one of concerns that comes with
	opening up data
Message-ID: <5D94356D-3C06-45AB-B664-16759A98BDAF@sfu.ca>

Personal privacy is not the only concern when opening up data.

The Weenusk First Nation in Canada's north, opposing mining  
development, says no to sharing of aerial geologic survey information:
http://www.wawataynews.ca/archive/all/2013/1/10/weenusk-first-nation-says-no-sharing-aerial-geologic-survey-information_23951?goback=.gde_2035350_member_203501850

Another example is data about endangered species. This data can be  
very useful - the problem is that the data can be very useful either  
to poachers or to those aiming to protect the species.

There is no such thing as truly pure science. All results of science  
that are disseminated (via open or toll access) are released into a  
world populated by many humans, some of whom wield economic and  
political power. This is not an argument against open data, rather an  
environment that should be considered when developed policies and  
strategies for open data.

I am grateful for the Ohm paper and I admit that I have possibly taken too
simplistic approach. I would be able to be convinced taht some human,
species and perhaps geodata may have to be hidden as it cannot be
anonymised..  However there are tens of billions of dollars or more public
data thrown away every year in physical sciences (chemistry, materials) and
the risk in making most of these public must be very small. It will be
important to draw some borderlines

There are dangers in opening up data - but let's not forget the  
dangers of secrecy.

Canada is actively muzzling its government scientists. Canada's  
Science Writers Association is keeping track of what they are up to:
http://sciencewriters.ca/initiatives/muzzling_canadian_federal_scientists/

This muzzling appears to have nothing to do with protecting Canadian  
privacy or the environment, but rather a lot more to do with  
protecting polluting companies and Canadian politicians from the  
scrutiny of democratic processes.

Another example: secrecy protects personal privacy - of the innocent  
citizen, or the corrupt politician or CEO.

Hey all,

I've been totally swamped as it is final rush for proposal
writing/submission, and interns welcome (two with me... yay :] ), etc.
Anyway, just on the top of my head: what possibilities for something more
hands-on such as DIYbio? I'd be very glad to work on this as well as on
some transmedia means of explaining tools or suchlikes.

Thanks,
Rayna

David, Josema and all
just following up on an earlier conversation
(cant believe it was in November!!)
any updates on this methodology, and how can we make this index a bit more
'open science' ?  I am forwarding to the public lists the correspondence
trail
Look forward to your reply

Thank you David

Interested  in the issue from more than one angle-
among others, this could be a  good case of #openscience

re point 2)
if that's the case, then it is obvious where the flaw of the methodology
is, and it can be easily fixed, by a sufficient (representative) number of
scorer and reviewers and then perform a meta-analysis of all the reviews

as with all cognitive science, people opinions vary depend on what
knowledge they hold. assume someone is really ignorant of some fact/issue,
then their opinion is likely to be falst/biased

we do not need to know the identity of the scorer/reviewr, but yes it would
be nice to see what data they have analysed .
would another scorer/reviewer with a different profile come up with a
different outcome?

how was the scorer/reviewers selected? based on what criteria?
were they paid? were they volunteers?

these are all issues which may impact the outcome of the study

Happy to have this portion of the conversation posted to list, I agree the
conversation should be in the public domain

The powerful can often acquire closed data by wielding their power
(for instance, by purchasing the data).  The weak can only access open
data.

I agree wholeheartedly.  Thus an open question for me is:  Should the
Open Data/Science movement consider a more pro-active approach in
defining some of those borderlines and good practice rather than
having to deconstruct a policy defined through a knee-jerk reaction to
a big privacy compromise or through slightly more nefarious agendas
such as the Canadian example that Heather gave?

Steve,

I'm going to wade in here with a related question. Who wants privacy, and
why? 

The reason I raise this is because of interactions I've had over the last
year with Stephen Friend (Sage Bionetworks) and the cancer communities his
organization deals with. These provide examples of individuals -
potentially very vulnerable people due to their genetic illnesses - who
actually want to share more personal medical data openly, for example
related to drug testing, because they believe that can accelerate
research. This is in contrast to corporations, which are reluctant to
share such data, because of its perceived value. The 'portable legal
consent' pioneered by Sage is a novel response to this conundrum.

I realize that this trend raises many profound questions: sharing your own
genetic and medical data means you are also sharing quite a lot of
information about your family. So do you need their consent, too? But it's
a trend that challenges perceptions of who is interested in preserving
data privacy, and why. Who's really afraid of Virginia Woolf?

Thoughts?

Francois

Heather and I may not see eye to eye on CC BY in open access, but I'm 
furiously applauding her posts on open data and privacy.

The point of raising this issue is not to use it as an argument 
*against* open data. It's to argue that our arguments *for* open data 
must contemplate all its realities, including those that require some 
uncomfortable thinking.

Anonymity is not the victim of "open" data - it's the victim of 
"abundant" data. We're very non-anonymous to lots of corporations and to 
our governments because of abundant data. Opening that data up just 
enlarges the sample size of those who might attempt to use abundant data 
to identify individuals.

The point about geographic sensitivity is also extremely well taken. I 
ran into this in an open roads project in central america a few years 
back - the very data used to track biodiversity created a roadmap for 
poachers of rare animals. It's tough.

But the privacy element is a poor reason to argue against open data, and 
arguing the risks of secrecy as a counterargument is an elegant 
formation that I think we should embrace...

There are dangers in opening up data - but let's not forget the
dangers of secrecy.

Canada is actively muzzling its government scientists. Canada's
Science Writers Association is keeping track of what they are up to:
http://sciencewriters.ca/initiatives/muzzling_canadian_federal_scientists/

This muzzling appears to have nothing to do with protecting Canadian
privacy or the environment, but rather a lot more to do with
protecting polluting companies and Canadian politicians from the
scrutiny of democratic processes.

Another example: secrecy protects personal privacy - of the innocent
citizen, or the corrupt politician or CEO.

Hi Francois,

Everyone wants privacy in some degree or another, in some context or
another.  Privacy is about control and expectation.  Informed consent,
which I think is a great idea, is a practical application of control
and expectation.  We would like to know what is known about us and
what the implications are of that knowledge.

Some might argue that privacy is dead and we should just get over it
but I think that would be a pity and might actually be detrimental to
freedom of speech.  If everything is public and observed, might we not
be less inclined to speak up?  Certainly some Open Government research
has pointed to this.

I think there is an opportunity to think creatively about Open Data
and Privacy although perhaps the Open Science list is not quite the
right place.  Where is the right place to have that discussion?

Cheers... Steve

Well, open science list is a perfectly good place to have this discussion, Steve. I am learning a lot from just watching this thread and reading and soaking in all the links. Please continue this very important topic.

There are benefits and downsides to open science, just as there are  
benefits and downsides to anything. Good planning and advocacy takes  
these into account - I agree with Puneet that it is important that the  
open science list discusses privacy and research data. My comments are  
on the need for privacy and why this does not go away in the online  
environment.
In some ways we have been conducting a society-wide experiment with  
less privacy, and there are indications that the heady early days of  
free personal sharing online without a care in the world are past  
their peak. Sharing everything with your friends on Facebook is a very  
different matter from when employers and parents are checking your  
status updates.

Confidentiality is considered an essential matter of ethics for a  
number of professions, and for good reasons.

The American Medical Association's page on confidentiality explains why:

"the purpose of a physician's ethical duty to maintain patient  
confidentiality is to allow the patient to feel free to make a full  
and frank disclosure of information to the physician with the  
knowledge that the physician will protect the confidential nature of  
the information disclosed. Full disclosure enables the physician to  
diagnose conditions properly and to treat the patient appropriately."  
from:
http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/legal-topics/patient-physician-relationship-topics/patient-confidentiality.page

Knowing that confidentiality is a matter of ethics for the doctor is  
often important for people to seek treatment in the first place. This  
affects all of us, because medical conditions often affect other  
people besides the patient.

Librarians have similar ethical obligations to maintain  
confidentiality, for similar reasons. It is important that people  
trust us enough to seek help finding answers to questions that they do  
not want to make public.

The requirement for confidentiality is the responsibility of the  
professional, not an obligation for the client. If a doctor diagnoses  
cancer, the doctor has a duty to keep this information confidential,  
while the patient is free to create a public blog to talk about their  
experience of being diagnosed with cancer. The fact that some people  
choose some level of publicness (some patients may choose a more semi- 
public route like joining a support group where they identify may be  
unknown, or known only to group members), does not mean that others  
will make a similar choice, and does not diminish in any way our  
obligations to respect privacy.

What does this mean for open data? If data cannot be properly  
anonymized, then some kinds of data cannot be completely open.  
However, there are degrees of open, such as open access to data for  
medical research purposes available to anyone at an appropriately  
accredited medical research organization who has completed a  
recognized ethics review.

best,

Heather Morrison

Hi there,

So I guess the question here is how do we allow to open data sets to have
different degrees of privacy. This is quite similar to the Creative Commons
licenses where some people do like them because you have different levels
of freedom to choose how do you want to share your data and under which
conditions.

Thus, it may be interesting to create a set of open data licenses that will
have different levels of privacy accordingly, so the in case of patients
they will actually choose how much do they want to share and how, even
specifying if the data could be used for commercial benefits as it happens
with the Creative Commons licenses, as some people will be fine with that,
while other people will be completely against this commercial option.

Dear Josema

thank you!. sorry I missed the response, I just remember not getting a
reply :-)

is this 'open science? or is it done behind closed doors>

are the questions regarding the methodology I asked in my email in
Nnovember being addressed if so, by who, where?

how can scientist and researchers working on similar tasks help with
validating the methodology or is this all being done by a few people behind
closed doors, in whIch case I would argue it is not open science)

(just trying to relate to this effort, channel contributions and make sure
we do not make similar mistakes in the future, perhaps>)

cheers

Hi All

There were concerns raised from the first meeting that the whole working
group is geared to restrictions and proprietary use e.g. looking solely at
licensing rather than exceptions, and that there was too little open access
and academic representation.

The EC are looking for suggestions for more WG4 (content mining) members to
ensure better representation from a wider range of stakeholders, so as well
as someone to take Peter's place while he's away, if you're at all
interested in joining please say so!

It's easy for the publishers to send staff along to this kind of meeting,
it's much harder for us as academics and open advocates to find the funding
and time to attend, but the more representation we have the better so
please consider and forward to anyone not on the list who you think might
be interested.

Best wishes

Jenny

Dear all,

In the last months we were working on the collaborative educational
content authoring platform http://SlideWiki.org
SlideWiki allows to create richly structured presentations comprising
slides, self-test questionnaires, illustrations etc.

SlideWiki *features* include:

* WYSIWYG slide authoring
* Logical slide and deck representation
* LaTeX/MathML integration
* Multilingual decks / semi-automatic translation in 50+ languages
* PowerPoint/HTML import
* Source code highlighting within slides
* Dynamic CSS themability and transitions
* Social networking activities
* Full revisioning and branching of slides and decks
* E-Learning with self-assessment questionnaires
* Source, citation and attribution tracking

All content in SlideWiki is licensed under CC-BY-SA. SlideWiki already
comprises a number of comprehensive course series on computer science
and Semantic Web topics, e.g.

It also describes a domain that is at the very moment very actively thinking about their future, how to publish (taxonomists have been the first who not only created a domain specific JATS DTD (Taxpub), but also created journal production workflows based on semantic enhanced and linked documents as well as tools to disseminate the content as widely as possibly and at the same time use the results to create mashups for each of the species described in the taxonomic work).

The Future of Botanical Monography: Report from an international workshop, 12-16 March 2012, Smolenice, Slovak Republic 

Abstract:

Monographs are fundamental for progress in systematic botany. They are the vehicles for circumscribing and naming taxa, determining distributions and ecology, assessing relationships for formal classification, and interpreting long-term and short-term dimensions of the evolutionary process. Despite their importance, fewer monographs are now being prepared by the newer generation of systematic botanists, who are understandably involved principally with DNA data and analysis, especially for answering phylogenetic, biogeographic, and population genetic questions. As monographs provide hypotheses regarding species boundaries and plant relationships, new insights in many plant groups are urgently needed. Increasing pressures on biodiversity, especially in tropical and developing regions of the world, emphasize this point. The results from a workshop (with 21 participants) reaffirm the central role that monographs play in systematic botany. But, rather than advocating abbreviated models for monographic products, we recommend a full presentation of relevant information. Electronic publication offers numerous means of illustration of taxa, habitats, characters, and statistical and phylogenetic analyses, which previously would have been prohibitively costly. Open Access and semantically enhanced linked electronic publications provide instant access to content from anywhere in the world, and at the same time link this content to all underlying data and digital resources used in the work. Resources in support of monography, especially databases and widely and easily accessible digital literature and specimens, are now more powerful than ever before, but interfacing and interoperability of databases are much needed. Priorities for new resources to be developed include an index of type collections and an online global chromosome database. Funding for sabbaticals for monographers to work uninterrupted on major projects is strongly encouraged. We recommend that doctoral students be assigned smaller genera, or natural portions of larger ones (subgenera, sections, etc.), to gain the necessary expertise for producing a monograph, including training in a broad array of data collection (e.g., morphology, anatomy, palynology, cytogenetics, DNA techniques, ecology, biogeography), data analysis (e.g., statistics, phylogenetics, models), and nomenclature. Training programs, supported by institutes, associations, and agencies, provide means for passing on procedures and perspectives of challenging botanical monography to the next generation of young systematists.

It is supposedly open access. Karol will look into this.

I too am getting

"Unable To Deliver Document

Not too surprising. The journal doesn't even have DOI's for its articles.
Not the best online publisher from a technical perspective by the looks of
it...

FWIW: it seems to me like it's a bug as I get the same
as you despite the fact that on top of the page it tells me
(I'm currently in my office at KI)

"Karolinska Institutet University Library is the largest medical library
in Sweden. The library services are primarily targeted at the students,
researchers, teachers and staff at the Karolinska Institutet. All
subscriptions accessible on ingenta to users within Karolinska
Institutet have been purchased by the library. "

which I interpret as having access to their subscription-based
offerings in principle.

No fun ...

This is an interesting thread.  To add to the list of personal medical
information and endangered species, we may as well add security risks too,
such as the much publicized debate over whether or not to publish the paper
on mutant flu, http://www.nature.com/news/specials/mutantflu/index.html.  I
mention this partly to highlight that this is not so much of a challenge
for "open science" but for science in general.

The open science agenda largely discusses removing barriers of costs and
institutional connections that inhibit more equal sharing, whether in data
or publication (in Nick Barnes words, the powerful have access).  I find
the analogies between open science and personal sharing on facebook
completely spurious.  When the scientific community decides something is
appropriate to publish in the international scientific literature, as they
did after careful consideration in the case of the mutant flu, then it
should be made open.  Security clearances, not cost or personal
connections, should protect secure data.  Sensitive data is a challenge for
the whole scientific community, not just open science.

Just my perspective. thanks to others in thread for sharing theirs.

Hi there,

So I guess the question here is how do we allow to open data sets to have different degrees of privacy. This is quite similar to the Creative Commons licenses where some people do like them because you have different levels of freedom to choose how do you want to share your data and under which conditions. 

Thus, it may be interesting to create a set of open data licenses that will have different levels of privacy accordingly, so the in case of patients they will actually choose how much do they want to share and how, even specifying if the data could be used for commercial benefits as it happens with the Creative Commons licenses, as some people will be fine with that, while other people will be completely against this commercial option.

From my point of view, in regards of personal data, it should be up to the owner of the data to choose actually how his/her personal data are going to be shared and under which terms. Obviously this is not something trivial to do, but hey, we are discussing here about how we could address this problem, right?

Comment:

This raises some interesting possibilities. E-health creates a new kind of "open" for patients - open access to their own lab data, previously available only to physicians. What if people were empowered to decide how their data might be shared further? I can see some interesting citizen science possibilities - do those prescription drugs really work better than alternative medicines? 

Patient data is very different from scholarly articles and even research datasets that can be made publicly available. Some questions to think about:

-	As datasets, not original expressions, patient data per se is considered copyrightable in some countries, but not others. Physician / patient's own notes attached to this data would be copyrightable.
-	As information that is not actually published, but rather private information, does copyright even apply? (It will if the data is made fully open, but what about private and semi-private information)?

The commercial question

One question that I'd like to highlight because patient data is an interesting case study. If patients were asked whether their data could be made available for commercial re-use (as with the Creative Commons licenses), what does commercial re-use mean? Some possibilities that I can think of off the top of my head that would constitute commercial use:

-	selling personal contact information to advertisers
-	selling health data information to insurance companies, companies that provide confidential advice to other companies on hiring practices (so that they can not hire you because of your health problems, or hire you to take out a life insurance policy because they know your odds of surviving for long are low)
-	providing free health data information to health care professional entrepreneurs, e.g. a rehabiltation practitioner who wants to develop tools that will be helpful to the patient

There are many other possibilities for use of information that could be considered commercial. My main point here is that there are commercial activities that a large percentage of the population (or health patients) would likely want to approve in advance, and other possibilities that most people probably don't want. Rather than attempt a blanket "commercial rights allowed", I think that a more nuanced, thoughtful approach to reap the benefits while avoiding at least the biggest and most obvious pitfalls would be advisable.

Hello everyone, I've created a bitly 'link bundle' gathering together these
and other links on material (blogs / PhD theses / articles / software) that
relates the 'data jigsaw' effect - combining datasets to re-identify them:

Indeed, nicely done Sam. Probably should add Ken Thompson's classic "Reflections on trusting trust" to this.

Hi Steve et al,

The ethical challenges surrounding genetic and medical data are profound. This NYT article gives some fascinating examples: http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/health/research/with-rise-of-gene-sequencing-ethical-puzzles.html?pagewanted=all

I'm suspicious of simple data-centric solutions in this space. It is not simply a question of defining degrees of privacy on data sets, much as that could be useful. It's about who should decide the degree of privacy, and when. It's about ethics.

One ethical problem is that "your data" is not just yours. It is shared to a high degree with your genetic family. Decisions you make to share data - in the hope of finding a cure for cancer, say - may infringe family members' privacy in ways that are hard to foresee.

Another ethical problem is that "informed consent" is never fully informed, because the consequences of releasing data change with time, as our scientific understanding of genetics and disease improves.

Doctors and researchers, bound by traditional views of data privacy and informed consent, may find themselves in profound ethical conundrums. The NYT article illustrates this with several poignant cases.

The issue here is not that we have to give up on data privacy, but that it in the rapidly changing and deeply interconnected world of medical genetics, traditional ideas of data privacy as individual and static may be dangerously inadequate.

This is definitely a topic that should be discussed in an open science forum. Advances in science and changing attitudes to openness are what makes this such a profound ethical problem. But it needs more than scientists and data experts to tackle it. Philosophers, lawyers and medical practitioners need to have a say, too.

And the pharma industry also has to be part of the debate. There are some surprisingly forward-thinking trends about open data emerging from big pharma, driven by the realization that open data can raise all ships. See for example this open innovation blog from Eli Lilly http://portal.lillycoi.com/

Hi Francois,

Everyone wants privacy in some degree or another, in some context or
another.  Privacy is about control and expectation.  Informed consent,
which I think is a great idea, is a practical application of control
and expectation.  We would like to know what is known about us and
what the implications are of that knowledge.

Some might argue that privacy is dead and we should just get over it
but I think that would be a pity and might actually be detrimental to
freedom of speech.  If everything is public and observed, might we not
be less inclined to speak up?  Certainly some Open Government research
has pointed to this.

I think there is an opportunity to think creatively about Open Data
and Privacy although perhaps the Open Science list is not quite the
right place.  Where is the right place to have that discussion?

Cheers... Steve

Steve,

I'm going to wade in here with a related question. Who wants privacy, and
why?

The reason I raise this is because of interactions I've had over the last
year with Stephen Friend (Sage Bionetworks) and the cancer communities his
organization deals with. These provide examples of individuals -
potentially very vulnerable people due to their genetic illnesses - who
actually want to share more personal medical data openly, for example
related to drug testing, because they believe that can accelerate
research. This is in contrast to corporations, which are reluctant to
share such data, because of its perceived value. The 'portable legal
consent' pioneered by Sage is a novel response to this conundrum.

I realize that this trend raises many profound questions: sharing your own
genetic and medical data means you are also sharing quite a lot of
information about your family. So do you need their consent, too? But it's
a trend that challenges perceptions of who is interested in preserving
data privacy, and why. Who's really afraid of Virginia Woolf?


Thoughts?

Francois

I agree wholeheartedly.  Thus an open question for me is:  Should the
Open Data/Science movement consider a more pro-active approach in
defining some of those borderlines and good practice rather than
having to deconstruct a policy defined through a knee-jerk reaction to
a big privacy compromise or through slightly more nefarious agendas
such as the Canadian example that Heather gave?

Hi All

While I'd strongly encourage the continuation of this thread (which is
fascinating), I'd just like to draw people's attention to a new working
group being formed at OKF on 'Open Data and MyData', to allow those from
all domains with an interest in digging deeper into some these issues to
discuss and act.

There's a subscription link in this blog post from Laura James

Thanks Jenny,
Let's keep this discussion going here. I'm learning a lot. I can see this
being managed in certain subdomains (e.g. species, medical) but it may well
exclude people. So we have to have an inclusive policy for people to be
involved. Any data have to be restricted we should be careful not to allow
"assume it's best left to the experts".

Thanks Mike,
I echo your sentiments (including your analysis of the lack of any coherent
concerted "Open Access" pollicy in the UK -
http://svpow.com/2013/02/22/the-progressive-erosion-of-the-rcuk-open-access-policy/.
The RCUK deserved our support but the OA oligarchy attacked it viciously
and relentlessly on dogmatic grounds. I have previously OKFN-blogged my
views on  the "Open" access movement (
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/10/26/is-open-access-open/ ).

The OKFN must never become riddled with factionalism - cf  the People's
Front of Judea (Monty Python). Its greatest assets are its
internationalilty, its huge proprtion of young people, its creation of
tools to change the world, its common purpose, its meriticracy and much
more.

Today I am going to the OKFN Open Data day in London and I'm going to have
fun and I'm going to listen to people and I'm going to help change the
world.

So is @okfn_okapi Chuff.

P.
I am of course delighted with the US policy. US politics is tricky and
there will no doubt be a backlash. As always they need our support.
As does the RCUK.

Subject: [open-science] Translations of open science roadmap documents in
	Poland
Message-ID: <CADfaFZo-kKG8nchpeWfQE88RCYQkVbRdGXA8pjY6-Csw6bBhkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Currently there are two roadmap documents concerning development of
open science in Poland in the works. One is an initiative of research
community (open science working group of movement called Citizen of
Science) and will concern general directions of development of open
science in areas of OA, OD, OER, citizen science etc. The other is a
document on OA (and most likely on OD) prepared by Polish Academy of
Sciences.

I am involved in preparations of both documents and I cannot promise
extremely progressive declarations in either of roadmaps (the biggest
factor is cost of certain 'open' solutions, such as gold OA on hybrid
terms). Nevertheless, both might be of interest to the international
open science community.

The question is if there is indeed an interest outside of Poland that
warrants translations of both documents into English? I don't mind
providing quick summary after both are published, but that's not I
mean here. If I have your explicit interest (especially from people
outside of UK/US), that could help in including international context
in the roadmap (which I would really like to have). That's why I'm
asking so early (the work just has started).

Best wishes
PS

of course it would be interesting to read what you guys are doing i Poland,
but I wonder

why was the original document not written in english in the first place
(the lingua franca
for scientific communication afaik)

translations can be awkard, costly, need checking etc

Thanks Paola.

These documents are not prepared by an international community, they
in principle concern only Poland and they do not qualify as
"scientific communication". I would have hard time convincing anybody
to work on them in English (additionally, it's actually forbidden by
law in case of the Academy to work on official documents in language
other than Polish).

I know that official translations add significant overhead, that's why
I'm asking if it's needed at all.

Cheers

Pawel

thank you. I understand there may be reasons for working in a local language

I think one of the central ideas in open science, is that in the current
climate and networked envronments, it is difficult , maybe impossible, to
do 'good science' in isolation

chosing a specific language means isolating the knowledge from anyone who
does not speak it

depends on what the community want to achieve.how long term they are
thinking. if they intend to continue to work
as the 'polish island' of open science, then translation is not needed

if they want to make sure their work is aligned, or at least related to the
rest of the world
work in this field of open science, then id say they have to chance their
rules, fast

it's difficult not to come across as arrogant anglocentrism with such a
request but...
It is estimated that if the EU had invested more money in training citizens
to speak english in the last 20 years (approx 5 years training per person
to achieve proficiency)
it would have saved masses of public money in translations (nightmare,
nightmare)


english please :-) or  probably remain an island

just my thought

Bingo, my dear Watson!

I want to insert that long term thinking into the process of
development of these documents. One step at a time. Today
translations, maybe next time English only.

But given that rest of the world isn't that aligned anyway (if it
were, you wouldn't mention "arrogant anglocentrism", would you? ), I
would like to hear if anybody else is interested in aligning it a bit
more.

Thanks

just to qualify that 'linguistic anglocentrism' statement

there are reasons why the English language is the lingua franca of
scientific communication (which one can argue /disagree with), but that is
not intended to diminish or the value beauty and semantic importance of the
other languages, from which English itself is coming from. it's shorter,
faster, easier, probably beacause it is a relatively 'modern' language

look forward to learn more what you people are working on, and let's not
forget
that google translations are not that bad for basic sense making of content
in other languages
 :-)

Pawe?,

I would certainly be interested in finding out which way the Polish scientific community is leaning. Hope that adds to your data points that might influence the translation.

Pawel --
Yes ! Translations would be of interest -- I have been working on open government at the national-level here in the US and your papers could be of interest/value...

Dear all,

SlideWiki.org is a non-profit, crowd-sourcing OpenCourseWare authoring
platform: http://SlideWiki.org
SlideWiki allows to create richly structured courseware presentations
comprising slides, self-test questionnaires, illustrations etc.
Slidewiki is for courseware what MediaWiki is for Wiki texts,
OpenStreetmaps for spatial data or GitHub for source code. With
SlideWiki, we hope to make educational material much more interactive,
multilingual and accessible.

We are now looking for additional lecture notes (i.e. slide series) for
publication on SlideWiki. We will support the import and enrichment of
the courseware in SlideWiki. Original authors will be attributed
prominently. A requirement is licensing of the content under CC-BY-SA.
We translate all SlideWiki lectures in many other languages, add
self-assessment tests, mobile learning facilities and many other
features. All SlideWiki features are documented here:
http://slidewiki.org/documentation/

Benefits for authors include:
* significantly increase your reach by making your courseware accessible
to a world-wide audience
* get your courseware translated into many different languages
* engage students in contributing to and discussing the course
* easily create (self-)assessment tests for students
* involve peer-educators in improving and maintaining the quality and
attractiveness of your courseware
* increase your reputation in the community, by sharing qualitative
educational content

Some existing example lectures include:

* Intelligent Systems: http://slidewiki.org/deck/1002/latest
* Semantic Web: http://slidewiki.org/deck/750/latest
* Semantic Web Services: http://slidewiki.org/deck/964/latest
* Information Retrieval: http://slidewiki.org/deck/345/latest
* Informationssysteme (German): http://slidewiki.org/deck/365/latest

Please send applications for publishing your lecture notes on SlideWiki
by email to auer at uni-leipzig.de till March 10 including the following
information:

* original authors (including email, address and affiliation)
* original format (pptx/ODP preferred)
* original language (English is preferred)
* volume (number of presentations and slides)
* licensing (must be compatible with CC-BY-SA)
* link to the material

Please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any further suggestions
and pointers to OpenCourseWare on the Web.

On behalf of the SlideWiki team,

S?ren

Dear S?ren,

I have tried slidewiki, and found it a very interesting
and promising tools. However, I have a few comments:
- navigating content could be improved. I want to see (and share with
others) a list of my presentations, or create a subject list -  not clear
how to do that.
- licence is too restrictive. I'm afraid I can't offer all my content under
a CC BY SA licence. Some of it is subject to employer's restrictions, some
already public under a different licence. I hope you will allow authors a
choice of licences.

best,

Yishay

Is it only for courses or is it also for personal collections?

Hi S?ren,
(and others)

it looks very promising!

(Though support for git (to edit things locally, in one's favourite browser) would be great. As well as for LaTeX (beamer)-based presentations... or even... Markdown (see http://jeromyanglim.blogspot.com.es/2012/07/beamer-pandoc-markdown.html). Also, Keynote and Open Office are popular...)

I had a similar idea and even mailed guys from https://speakerdeck.com (since it is GitHub-affiliated) whether they want/plan to make a GitHub-like approach to source of presentations and invitation for sharing. (The response was enthusiastic... but the feature is still not there.)

When it comes to licensing, I'm more into CC BY since it is really free (well, only more free is public domain or CC0). And, perhaps, I'm not the only one.

Side note: when it comes to licensing, can anyone point to a good layman introduction what is considered a derivate work?
In particular, when when I use (say) one slide with CC BY SA in a collection of 50 slides, does one need to license this particular slide with CC BY SA (with all modifications) or the whole presentation?

Regards,
Piotr Migdal

S?ren,

This is good, with all the right capabilities for a science-related presentation. I have the following concerns --

On Feb 24, 2013, at 4:16 AM, "S?ren Auer" <auer at informatik.uni-leipzig.de> wrote:

> SlideWiki is for everything licensed CC-BY-SA. You are more than welcome to use it for your personal presentations.

I am not sure what you mean by the above. What if I want to license my content as CC BY, or CC0 (the latter being my personal preference)? Should I *not* use SlideWiki then? 

And, what is implication of "You are more than welcome to use it for your personal presentations"? When would I be putting up a presentation that is *not* my personal presentation?

Finally, most importantly, I can see the human-readable summary of the Terms of Use (http://slidewiki.org/termsOfUse). But, there is no link to the actual legal document. There is a link to Wikipedia's TOU, but Wikipedia's TOU are not Slidewiki's TOU even if the latter are adapted from the former.

Many thanks,

Anybody correct me if I'm wrong, but the presentation is a remix and
Share-Alike (or ND) conditions of licenses of the remixed works apply
to the remix: http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Can_I_combine_works_that_use_different_Creative_Commons_licenses_into_my_work.3F

So "SA" enforces the license of the whole presentation.

Cheers

You could just create an envelop presentation, where you add all the
presentations you want to share as sub-presentations. We already do that
for the lecture series, where we have a deck for the whole lecture
series, with subdecks for each individual lecture. Also, each slide and
presentation has its own URL, which makes it easy to create lists of
presentation and share them. Furthermore, you can see all decks created
by you in your profile.

That's more tricky - we want to make SlideWiki.org really an open
platform and thats why CC-BY-SA is a requirement. I guess content
licensed under even more liberal licenses can be easily re-licensed as
CC-BY-SA - you could then just mention in the deck description, that
this deck can be used under even more liberal licensing conditions (e.g.
CC0). For stricter licensing than CC-BY-SA, a possibility could be to
host your own SlideWiki, but we haven't released the source-code yet
(but definitely plan to do so).

Hope this helps, please feel free to subscribe to our mailinglist to
stay in touch: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/slidewiki

Best,

S?ren

Unless, of course, one of these exceptions apply:

http://wiki.creativecommons.org/FAQ#Do_Creative_Commons_licenses_affect_exceptions_and_limitations_to_copyright.2C_such_as_fair_dealing_and_fair_use.3F

whether using a single slide out of 50 would be considered "fair use" would
depend on how central the slide was too the original presentation, the
intended use of the new presentation, and perhaps some other factors, but
I'd guess that more often than not it would qualify for a fair use
exception.

The download and re-import of HTML/deck.js presentations is already
possible, this way you can work offline, but I agree, this might be an
experimental feature currently and we have to improve this in the next
weeks (particularly when conflicts arise with other users, who were
editing the same deck).

We were working on a LaTeX beamer import, but this is really tricky,
since you can do almost everything with LaTeX and writing an importer is
really complex.

Markdown editing is definitely on our ToDo list as well. Please

I think using SlideWiki for more liberal content is easy, just add a
note that this content is also available under e.g. CC0 to the deck
description. CC-BY-SA should just be the lowest common denominator.
Maybe we should indeed add the possibility to directly license content
under even more liberal licenses.

I would say only the particular slide, but I'm not a lawer.

Thanks for your suggestions!

As can be seen from the discussion CC-BY-SA (which is what Wikipedia uses)
requires more care in re-use than CC-BY.

There seem to be at least three separately licenceable components:

   1. * the software/infrastructure
   2. * the courseware content
   3. * any third-party content which is used in the system (either in the
   public version or a private copy)

Can you clarify what the licence is on 1 (in and empty state). IOW can we
clone the system or use a public empty version which does not overlap with
2?

We were thinking about this quite much and decided that particularly
since Wikipedia uses CC-BY-SA, we want to enable SlideWiki users to
reuse and remix Wikipedia content, so CC-BY-SA became the default.
However, nobody prevents a SlideWiki user to release his contributions
additionally under another license and as mentioned before, this could
be just indicated in the deck description.

We plan to release the software as open-source, but this needs more time
and preparation - currently too many things are hard-wired for our
setup. We will announce the availability in due course on the SlideWiki
mailinglist:

Dear all,

I just published an extensive blog post on the recent policy developments, as well as new models for academic publishing, such as PeerJ and overlay journals.

Although most list readers are very likely familiar with the topics, you might find the graphic I prepared (with comments from Ross and Jani Kotakoski) to illustrate the various models of use. It's also freely available on Figshare (in pdf format).

Thanks for your time,
Toma

Hi Francois,

It is a fascinating problem.  It is not hard to envisage a future
where there is so much data "exhaust" in the digital atmosphere that
it is technically impossible to preserve personal privacy in any kind
of meaningful way.  Perhaps we are already there.  If so, then we will
need mechanisms to help us choose not to look, in the same way we
might discreetly look the other way if someone's wardrobe
malfunctioned as opposed to re-viewing it millions of times on
youtube.  I recently came across a interesting paper entitled "Code,
Nudge, or Notice?"
(http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2217013) which
explores different incentive mechanisms for getting people to do the
right thing or in this case not do the wrong thing.  I think there is
a lot of scope for creativity in encouraging openness while respecting
privacy.

Subject: [open-science] release of DataONE R Client packages
Message-ID: <CABHpJO0P9dZtiPuVzXaoPaqDJFRHH6pa2XSBmJbXuTgy_9227A@mail.gmail.com>

The DataONE team is happy to announce the release of the first version of
the DataONE R Client, our package for accessing open data in DataONE from
within the R environment for statistical computing.  The DataONE R Client
provides the ability to access open ecological, environmental, and earth
science data from the DataONE network of repositories, and to save data
from within R to DataONE repositories that support write access.  Because
data are accessed via their published, unique identifiers (rather than a
local file path), R scripts can be written to be portable across different
users, and thus can be more effectively published themselves.

More details, downloads, and documentation:
   https://releases.dataone.org/online/dataone_r/

More about DataONE:
    http://dataone.org

The DataONE R Client is released as an open source package under the Apache
2.0 license, and we welcome contributions.  Please contact us at
developers at dataone.org with feedback, contributions, and questions.

Matt Jones
on behalf of the DataONE development team

Ok, maybe I phrased it not precisely: You can use SlideWiki for
everything which's license is compatible with CC-BY-SA. So please add a
note stating that your content is also available as CC-BY or CC0 to the
deck description - as I understand CC-BY or CC0 licensed content can
always re-licensed as CC-BY-SA.

> And, what is implication of "You are more than welcome to use it for your personal presentations"? When would I be putting up a presentation that is *not* my personal presentation?

You could also upload CC-BY-SA licensed content, which was created by
other people. SlideWiki offers a "Original creator" field to attribute
the original author for that purpose. But my comment was more a response
to Peter's question "Is it only for courses or is it also for personal
collections?"

> Finally, most importantly, I can see the human-readable summary of the Terms of Use (http://slidewiki.org/termsOfUse). But, there is no link to the actual legal document. There is a link to Wikipedia's TOU, but Wikipedia's TOU are not Slidewiki's TOU even if the latter are adapted from the former.

Good point, we will add a full text of the TOU, soon.

Subject: [open-science] HEFCE (UK) seeking advice on open access & open data
	research evaluation
Message-ID: <CAJr+OExpVtoi=knT54NzLPZaX33b1ZQAWxqHytMymWOxvMfjcw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In recent times in the UK we've had a House of Lords inquiry, and
a Department for Business, Innovation & Skills inquiry to which the Open
Knowledge Foundation and others have contributed evidence & advice to help
guide policy.

Well, there's now *another *consultation open. This time it's the Higher
Education Funding Council for England
<http://www.hefce.ac.uk/about/>(HEFCE) who do the job evaluating &
rating the quality of academic research
output in England (the 'REF <http://www.ref.ac.uk/>' process).

Their call for advice on open
access<http://www.hefce.ac.uk/news/newsarchive/2013/name,78750,en.html>
in
the context of the REF is interesting and certainly worthy of contribution
from our community (anyone can submit a relevant statement) - I should
particularly draw your attention to the section on OPEN DATA:

24. As a principle, we support the sharing of research data as an important
approach to further
increasing the effectiveness of the research process. However, while we
expect to see
considerable progress in the provision of access to data which are
pertinent to those publications
submitted in a future REF, we do not consider it feasible at present to
make this a formal
requirement.
25. With the Research Councils and the Research Transparency Sector Board,
we are giving
consideration to the issues involved in increasing access to research data.
We are committed to
working in dialogue with the sector to develop fair and balanced mechanisms
to achieve this aim.

*We invite comment on whether respondents feel this is the appropriate
approach or*
*whether they feel that sufficient progress has in fact been made to
implement a*
*requirement for open data as well. We will consider any representations
that such a*
*requirement may reasonably now be developed but would also need advice on
how this*
*might be achieved.*

*[me:] Has sufficient progress been made in science so that Open Data
research outputs must be made available for research evaluation?
*
The recent US OSTP OA policy seemed to indicate that open data has
certainly 'arrived'. Moreover, if we *don't* reward or evaluate academics
for data sharing - this rather limits their incentives to do so.

Even if you don't want to submit a comment to HEFCE yourself about this,
perhaps it would be worth discussing the issues on-list?

The deadline for submissions is the 25th of March, so we have plenty of
time.


Best,

Ross

I think a continued neglect of data sharing in the evaluation of
research outputs is to be avoided. it would certainly be good to get
the evaluators to agree on the idea of some sort of bonus points for
research shared in ways other than through formal papers.

While the scientific community at large is probably not ready for data
sharing mandates, there is nothing wrong in working out a prototype of
such mandates for certain kinds of data, or for an institution,
journal, funder or subdiscipline.

I read parts of the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode
and now I have a very different understanding to looking at shorter description and some, not necessarily the most representative cases. 

Except for the "Fair use" case (which, may depend a lot on country)... and a typical "No one will care, sue or even get angry (I hope author is OK with that)", CC BY SA make a distinction between "adaptation" (where you need to apply CC BY SA) and "collection" (where you need to apply CC BY SA _only_ to this part).

It that sense CC BY SA seems to not be as viral (and thus of very limited reusability) as I thought. 

In particular, (again, I now little about copyright law) it _seems_ that using a slide with CC BY SA license ensures that this slide (with further modifications) will remain under CC BY SA, but do not force to apply to other slides.

Though, the distinction between "adaptation" and "collection" may be tricky even on philosophical grounds, not to say on legal.

Regards,
Piotr

This would be a wonderful thing for science and for a hackathon. Maybe we
could get publishers such as BMC and PLoS involved.

Dear List of OKFN,

I am Erik and I work for the Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) [1]. We
are a non-profit organisation that is dedicated to the furthering of Free
Software and working for freedom in the emerging digital society.

Some days ago I had the chance to meet Beatrice Martini [2] and we had some
exchange of ideas. She was very interested in our Document Freedom campaign
that comes with an international day to celebrate the use of Open Standards.
As it is a decentralised campaign that has its focus on local activities,
she told me to send a mail to this list to engage some of you to participate
- - hence, I'll give it a try : )

What is document freedom? Have you ever been stuck with some data that you
have not been able to open because it was in a format that needs some
specific kind of software to open it? Can you imagine that the same things
happen each day tens of thousands of times? Can you imagine how much
knowledge exchange doesn't happen just because sender and receiver
(intentionally or not) are using different data formats? Can you imagine how
much knowledge future generations will lose if we keep on using proprietary,
closed data formats that one day no one will ever be able to open because
the company behind it had business secrets and patents on it but then got
bankrupt?
Open Standards on the other hand are data formats that have an open
documentation and everyone is free to use or implement it in its own
software. The first characteristic (open documentation) guarantees that now
and even in a hundred of years everybody interested can understand the data
format and read it. The second characteristic (free to use) guarantees that
now and in even in a hundred years everybody is free to write some piece of
software to give everyone else the ability to read a specific piece of data.
That is why everyone and every public institution - education and
administration, e.g. - should use Open Standards.

This is exactly the point where our document freedom campaign comes in.
Every year on the last Wednesday of March, we run a global campaign that is
called "Document Freedom Day" [3]. The concept of the campaign and its aim
is to raise awareness of the usefulness of Open Standards. Therefore we
encourage all kind of local groups to organise an event that highlights the
importance of the use of Open Standards. Last year there have been more than
50 events in more than 20 countries [4]. This year, Document Freedom Day
(DFD) will be on the *27th of March 2013*.

The most important part of the whole campaign is done by guys like you and
me! In order to celebrate information accessibility and Open Standards, we
heavily depend on local activity on public places, in universities, in
hackerspaces or everywhere you can imagine. I am pretty sure that you have
very good ideas what you can do to raise some attention. You can also
combine your activity with promotion for the OKFN.

If you are interested now, please have a look at some ideas of what you can
do [5] and feel free to support your event with our promotion material [6]
that you can order for no cost. You can order the material on the webpage or
just reply to this email. Finally, if you are planning some activity, don't
forget to register your event on our events page [7].

Thank you very much for your attention.
Your participation in DFD can make the difference!

Thank you very much in advance,
   Erik

You are correct about "may be tricky" part, but that is the nature of law. Everything is decided on a case-by-case basis, and rarely is anything clear cut.

I asked our legal team this very question yesterday, and the following was explained with the prerequisite "It depends" and "This is not legal advice," etc.

It really depends on how integral is the CC BY-SA slide to your presentation. If you can leave the slide out without substantially changing the nature and meaning of your presentation, then the slide is not central to your presentation, and then you can mark that slide as CC BY-SA (its original license), and mark the rest of your presentation as being something else. You can think of the CC BY-SA just being in close proximity to your own slides.

On the other hand, if the CC BY-SA slide is central to your presentation, and your presentation wouldn't be what it is without that slide, then you are really creating an adaptation, and in that case your entire presentation has to be CC BY-SA.

Hope that makes sense. It does to me.

That's very useful. I was worried about my current presentation as it has
some Wikipedia slides. But they can be pulled without destroying it.
Typical examples are pictures that make it more fun to read but aren't
critical.

*Already sent to the open sustanability list*

Hi All,

Does someone of you know where I can find microdata (CO2 emission per
installation) collected under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme
Data <1> or confirm that there is no open dataset available. All I found is
this
http://www.eea.europa.eu/data-and-maps/data/data-viewers/emissions-trading-viewer

Here in France, we are working on  http://opentransition.okfn.fr, a simple
website + datahub group for sharing open ressources on energy as part of
the French national debate on Energy Transition (project to be announced
Tomorrow).

Lack of CO2 microdata emission is something we would like to highlight.

Thanks a lot
Pierre

Brilliant. FWIW I am judging the BMC data awards and documentation of the
heterogeneous file types would be valuable. This could spread to other
disciplines. We could and should reference it from OpenResearchData
Handbook.
