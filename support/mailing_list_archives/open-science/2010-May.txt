Dear all,

 

In recognition of the fact that science publishing now goes beyond the
traditional journal article, BioMed Central have teamed up with
Microsoft Research <http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/>  and Panton
Principles <http://pantonprinciples.org/>  to introduce the Open Data
Award <http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/otherawards/>  as
part of BioMed Central's 4th Annual Research Awards
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/> .

 

The Open Data Award celebrates researchers who have published in any of
our 207 journals <http://www.biomedcentral.com/browse/journals/>  during
2009 and have demonstrated leadership in the sharing, standardization,
publication, or re-use of biomedical research data. The article should,
either as an additional/supplementary file or via a link to a
publicly-available dataset, enable the sharing and re-use of scientific
data associated with a published article

On the judging panel we are honoured to be joined by Peter Murray-Rust,
Cameron Neylon, Rufus Pollock and John Wilbanks of Panton Principles
along with Lee Dirks from Microsoft Research.


The shortlist will be announced soon, but we are still receiving
nominations. Please let me know if you would like to nominate an article
or have any questions about this initiative.

 

Best regards,

 

Iain

Can you tell me more on how that shortlist is created? For example,

To: bbb at bioinformatics.org


For three weeks Kaggle, a platform for data prediction competitions, has
been running a bioinformatics competition
(http://kaggle.com/hivprogression). The competition requires competitors
to pick markers in HIV's genetic sequence that predict a change in viral
load.

The results have been better than we could have hoped for. Within a week
and a half, the best submission had already outdone the best methods in
the literature. (This is particularly surprising when you consider that
the prize is just $500 and the opportunity to co-author a paper with the
competition host.) There's a short post about the results so far on the
Kaggle blog
(http://kaggle.com/blog/2010/05/13/are-competitions-the-future-of-research/).

This early result suggests that Kaggle has hit on a great way to do open
science. A contributing factor in the success of the Predict HIV
Progression competition is the degree of cooperation on the
competition's forum. Moreover, by hosting this competition, William has
opened up his dataset to other scientists, giving them access to a
problem they wouldn't otherwise know about.

Kaggle doesn't control the results - their fate is up to the competition
host. William is planning on open sourcing the winning method to the
Predict HIV Progression competition.

We want to repeat this feat so we are looking for others to open up
their problems. If you are interested, please get in touch
(anthony.goldbloom at kaggle.com).

Dear Bryan,

You can find svg versions of the buttons here:

There is also a README.txt:

<http://m.okfn.org/images/ok_buttons/README.txt>

(Also available direct from the mercurial repo [1] in which this is stored)

Hope this helps!

BTW: if anyone out there wants to contribute buttons (different
colours, designs etc) we'd love to include them (with appropriate
credit!) -- just send an svg ...

Hi all,

first my congratulations on the new release!

I was browsing around a bit, fixing some details of some data sets,
and noted that I could not vote... I get a message:

"You don't have permission to access /package/rate/bodr on this server."

Can this please be verified?

Egon, we have temporarily had to shut off the rate functionality due
to a bot problem (basically package/rate is currently allowing GET
requests and the bot was not respecting nofollow and making a *lot* of
requests per sec).

We're looking to fix this problem but in the mean time we've
re-enabled rating so please rate away ...

Thanx!

BTW, where can I leave feature requests?

Some things I am thinking about:

* user based activity RSS feed (for FriendFeed)
* RSS feeds for updates on packages for a certain tag
* filter feeds based on license

Perhaps this is too much as RSS as API? But it would be great to route
all new and updated Open Data packages on chemistry to the matching FF
group...

All sensible requests. Please feel free to create tickets. I think
most of these are new though I think group/tag feeds already have a
ticket here (comment if not what you want):

OK, thanx!

One last thing then: is there a SPARQL end point? I noticed the REST
api [0] and saw the RDF output, but would very much prefer to use RDF
for querying API... SPARQL would be most convenient then... otherwise,
a way to download the full RDF dump of all data, so that I could run
the SPARQL client side...

Hi all,

one more question about CKAN... I just updated some info on the LODD
data, and then saw that there is actually a second entry for the same
data:

http://ckan.net/package/linking-open-drug-data
http://ckan.net/package/lodd_group

How does one merge two entries and remove the duplicate?

Subject: [open-science] CHEMBL curators
Message-ID: <AANLkTilGEPVAn7I300-DYSBFYtxqoE8s92XKcnEJj4WO@mail.gmail.com>

This call for part-time curators at the CHEMBL project might be of
interest to some folks here:

http://chembl.blogspot.com/2010/05/part-time-curators-biological-drugs.html

I've also just created a package for this on CKAN:

http://ckan.net/package/chembl

Anyone want to help flesh out the notes section? We should also add
this to chemistry group ...

All the best,

Jonathan

Subject: [open-science] GSK Malaria data and IsItOpen
Message-ID: <AANLkTinDYqMEeEr8Q0mjbe3UDHWR8VybJ-dw0NglEj9N@mail.gmail.com>

I've been sent an advert for the GSK open malaria data and asked for its
status on
http://www.isitopendata.org/enquiry/view/5a05df4b-75a2-4192-8f7a-7d259cde371f/
I think this is a good category of datasets to chase uising IIO and I'd
appeal for volunteers to look for otehrs and chase existing enquiries

It's under CC0. See http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chemblntd/

(it's also deposited in multiple locations, but the explicit license data is at EBI)

Excellent! I thought it was somewhere, but this gives a chance for the
distributors to reply positively and to their credit.

Do people think we should we add details to the CHEMBL package, or
create a new one?

  http://ckan.net/package/chembl

Is there anyone in contact with folks from either the malaria data
project or CHEMBL who would be willing to invite them to this mailing
list?

All the best,

Jonathan

I know them pretty well on the GSK side (we worked pretty closely with the spanish site on figuring out data licensing terms) but I would be surprised if they were to participate here. Don't know the CHEMBL folks.
