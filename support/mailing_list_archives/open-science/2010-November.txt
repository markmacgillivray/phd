Since this focuses in part on the digital economy and collaboration it may
be of interest especially to any Indian OKF members

*INDIA-UK COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH INITIATIVE IN ?BRIDGING THE URBAN AND RURAL
DIVIDE?*

*DEADLINE for **registration** of intention to submit: **1 December 2010*

*DEADLINE: **5 January 2011*

The Research Councils UK (RCUK) and the Indian Department of Science and
Technology (DST) expect to support large collaborative consortia projects
from this call which address the research challenges set out below.

*FUNDING*: The costs of the UK Institutions will be met from RCUK funds,
those for the Indian partner institutions will be met by the DST. Projects
should be three years in duration.

*SCOPE*: This call will focus on ?Bridging the Urban and rural Divide?. The
Research projects are required to address at least one theme (Energy,
Healthcare, Enterprise) and be underpinned by robust, digitally secure
systems. Proposals must show awareness of the principles of the call and
must be highly cross-disciplinary and collaborative in nature.

A key aim of this scheme is to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration on
common research challenges for the UK and India, with a focus on technical
challenges in Energy and Digital Economy.

*ELIGIBILITY*: Usual eligibility requirements of DST and EPSRC apply. In
addition:

   - Only activities that involve academic collaboration between the UK and
   India can be considered.
   - The Proposals should be for consortia and should include both UK and
   Indian partners.
   - Proposals involving industrial collaborators are welcomed but costs for
   these partners will not be covered by DST/ EPSRC through this call.
   - Proposals involving Non-government Organisations (NGOs) are welcomed.
   Costs for such partners in India will be covered by DST, but NGO partners in
   the UK must fund their participation from other sources.
   - UK and Indian lead investigators and co-investigators should be
   academic researchers from institutions eligible to apply for EPSRC/DST
   funding respectively, or researchers from Science and Technology NGOs in
   India.


*APPLICATION PROCEDURE*: EPSRC will handle proposals on behalf of RCUK.

Lead partners must register their intention to submit by contacting Hannah
Foreman (*Hannah.foreman at epsrc.ac.uk* <Hannah.foreman at epsrc.ac.uk>, 01793
444428) by 16:00 (GMT) by *1 December 2010*.  At this stage, a very brief
outline is required; details of the proposal are permitted to change before
the closing date for applications.

The UK based lead partner will should prepare and submit the proposal using
the Research Councils? Joint electronic Submission (Je-S) System (*
https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/* <https://je-s.rcuk.ac.uk/>) by *16:00 (GMT) on **5
January 2011*.  The India-based lead partner will submit the identical
proposal (five hard copies of the Je-S form) using the same common proposal
format to DST for processing as per requirements of DST India (*
http://www.scienceandsociety-dst.org* <http://www.scienceandsociety-dst.org>
).

EPSRC must receive applications

**Apologies for Cross-Posting!**

You may have seen my message earlier in the year about the British
Library's pilot for finding research data alongside Library resources
at http://searchbeta.bl.uk. We have been improving and adding further
resources to the service, making an additional set covering
biodiversity available.

We would like to find out how the community would use such a service
to search for data for use in research, so have created a survey to
gather more detailed feedback:
http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DataResources. This also covers the
metadata that people want to use for discovery. If you have, are, or
plan to reuse data in your work, please do visit our survey - all
responses will be invaluable in improving and expanding the pilot.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me!

Dear colleagues, 

I am involved in a project, run by the Scientific and
Cultural Affairs Office of the Spanish Embassy in UK, aimed to tighten the
bonds of cooperation between the scientific communities of both countries.
We are specially interested in the open science movement, engaging
scientists in cooperative projects from the bottom up, promoting the
creation of hackspaces and biolabs and this sort of grassroots initiatives.

I'm replying to Enric who mailed the open-science group of the OKF. I have
copied in the Quixote mailing list

Enric,
Thisis to introduce you to the Quixote project which is an Open Source Open
Science/data project in computational chemistry which arose out of a meeting
in Zaragosa two moths ago and which has resulted in a dynamic project
involving a multinational community but very defintely with Spanish origin
and flavour. It takes its theme from our aim to change the world by
attempting the impossible.

I suggest you contact Pablo (Madrid, copied) and see what common ground you
have and what we can do together. I think it's a great story which should
help to inspire others.

We tick all your boxes -
open science movement,  YES
engaging scientists in cooperative projects from the bottom up, YES
 promoting the creation of hackspaces YES
and biolabs ; SOME overlap
and this sort of grassroots initiatives. YES

We are also startting to develop tools for Open Courseware and experiments
(these are computational) which preserve their outputs for future students
to build upon.

Best

P.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimyVfQQnC1uibxhb6KoMqtswyNfjxeYXSJV0KzB@mail.gmail.com>

Hi open science list,

Since citations to datasets and other nontraditional research products is a
subject near and dear to our hearts, I wanted to spread the word about a
just-launched open document: A Community
Hub<https://docs2.google.com/document/d/1mHYlu3IU3q6RaJfkxyNZQcykYMB-iak4N2Gd3fNgd2Q/edit?hl=en#>
 for* improving tool support for tracking citations to nontraditional
products*.

As you may know, it is not currently
possible<http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/tracking-dataset-citations-using-common-citation-tracking-tools-doesnt-work/>
to
track citations to datasets through Scopus and ISI Web of Science, even if
the datasets have DOIs or other recognized identifiers.   The purpose of
this hub is to provide:

   - a central meeting ground for the many individuals and organizations
   interested in this issue
   - a living document that captures current unmet needs
   - an area to inventory and develop initiatives to encourage vendors to
   address these issues as soon as possible

Please check it
out<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHYlu3IU3q6RaJfkxyNZQcykYMB-iak4N2Gd3fNgd2Q/edit?hl=en>,
add what you know, and send the link around to others you know who care
about this issue so that we can achieve data citation tracking through
Scopus and Web of Science ASAP.

Sincerely,
Heather

My concern is that the collection of metrics by commercial companies is
opaque and hence potentially flawed. Moreover you cannot use these data for
schmolarly research - or if you do you are not allowed to publissh the
results. So I would be concerned about helping to perpetuate this. I can
give more info by skype.

Hi Peter,

Good points.  I agree, the scope of the current effort is very small:
 simply to enable tracking citations of a certain form using a number of
existing tools.

Calculating and disseminating useful metrics for the wide range of research
products is a much more difficult (and important) issue.

YES agreed on value of open citation systems rather than the current closed
systems.  MUCH more valuable, in a paradigm-shifting way.

At this same time, there is immense value in tracking new research products
NOW, the "standard" way, in parallel with building open systems for the
future, even given the limited ways the closed-system data can be obtained
and extracted and understood and disseminated.  I think the benefits that
standard citation measurements will bring to recognition of nontraditional
research products outweighs the disadvantages.  I can understand that
opinions on such an approach may vary, though.

Heather

Message-ID: <AANLkTin3RMg=Cj7woGa8FTMCq34K9r+aYchpG1RpKozL@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Just a quick note to mention that our next working group meeting is coming
up soon. Apologies for the absence of a meeting this month, I was trying to
organise one but it turns out my emails haven't been reaching the list, so
I'm starting again! This will be the last meeting before 2011 so it would be
great if as many people as possible could participate, everyone is welcome
whether you've attended in the past or not.

When:      Wednesday 1st December at 17.30 GMT
Location:  #okfn IRC channel on oftc.net (quick link http://ur1.ca/4fh) and
Skype (add your Skype ID to http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-meetings)

Please add your name and Skype ID to the list of attendees on
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-meetings
Add anything you'd like to be discussed or new ideas to the agenda (even if
you can't make it yourself, just make sure you add enough details).

I'll be helping Greg with working group coordination going forward, and
getting involved with some other tasks at the OKF, so I look forward to
being in touch with many of you soon!

Jenny

community work on tools for tracking citations to datasets.

See the message below and contribute to the Community Hub!

Best wishes,

Hi Simon,

In case you haven't seen this already, I want to make sure you and
JISC are aware of the just-launched open document: A Community
Hub<https://docs2.google.com/document/d/1mHYlu3IU3q6RaJfkxyNZQcykYMB-iak4N2Gd3fNgd2Q/edit?hl=en#>
for improving tool support for tracking citations to nontraditional
products.

As you know, it is not currently
possible<http://researchremix.wordpress.com/2010/11/09/tracking-dataset-citations-using-common-citation-tracking-tools-doesnt-work/>
to track citations to datasets through Scopus and ISI Web of Science,
even if the datasets have DOIs or other recognized identifiers. ? The
purpose of this hub is to provide:

?* ? a central meeting ground for the many individuals and
organizations interested in this issue
?* ? a living document that captures current unmet needs
?* ? an area to inventory and develop initiatives to encourage vendors
to address these issues as soon as possible

The document would certainly benefit from JISC input, since you and
your projects are looking at this issue from many angles.

Please check it
out<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mHYlu3IU3q6RaJfkxyNZQcykYMB-iak4N2Gd3fNgd2Q/edit?hl=en>,
add what you know, suggest some ideas, and send the link around to
others who care about this issue so that we can achieve data citation
tracking through Scopus and Web of Science ASAP. ?Thanks!

Sincerely,
Heather

Hi Open Science,

Wanted to let you know that Nature has responded to our IsItOpenData?
enquiry.  Their response is at the IsItOpenData site, and I've also blogged
it <http://science.okfn.org/2010/11/26/natures-response-to-isitopendata/> on
the open science blog (psst anyone else want to blog there too?  It is
fun!).

Note that Nature's response requires some careful reading.  Nonetheless,
kudos to them for responding.

That wraps up my IsItOpenData enquiries for a while.  Thanks to everyone who
helped make it happen.  To make future enquiries easier, I pulled together a
quick blog post with
tips<http://science.okfn.org/2010/11/26/isitopendata-tips/>and lessons
learned.  Please add more info in the comments!

Sincerely,
Heather

Thank you very much Heather. We appreciate the work you have done and how
much effort it was!

It's really important that others take this up. It's now fairly
straightforward mechanically - just needs consistent continuing effort.

Indeed. I left a comment in your blog post (being moderated).

"About that YES on 4 ("May the extracted data be used as Open Data
[1,2] without discrimination against users, groups, or fields of
endeavor?") and 5 ("May users expose the extracted data as Open Data
[1,2], in a manner consistent with the Panton Principles
(http://pantonprinciples.org/)? Specifically, may they expose the
extracted data on the internet under a Public Domain, PDDL
(http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/) or CC0 waiver
(http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0)?").

I am wondering if that answer should not really be a NO. That is, they
clearly write that if you extract significant data, you still require
permisson. That does not sound like Open Data to me.

Do you agree with Nature that their answer is really YES, instead of
NO or YES/NO? If so, what arguments would you give for that? If not,
why do you think their answer does not open the doors for
discrimination against users, groups, or fields of endeavor?"

Good point.

Two possibilities, I think. By "we believe there is a potential obligation"
they either meant "we release the data under under an occasional obligation
to" or as "we think the best practice community norm is."

What do you think?

For list reference, here are their answers under discussion:

*

4) YES ? If substantial data is taken from a paper we believe there is a
potential obligation on the extractor to request permission from the author
(of the paper) about the re-use of their data, and a requirement to credit
the original author.

5) YES ? If substantial data is taken from a paper we believe there is a
potential obligation on the extractor to request permission from the author
(of the paper) about the re-use of their data, and a requirement to credit
the original author.
