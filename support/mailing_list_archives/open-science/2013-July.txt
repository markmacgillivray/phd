I have written a blogpost on an effort for an inclusive approach to open
science that started at a meeting here in Graz. Please do get into the
discussion and let us know about your ideas!

Hey Stefan

Thanks for this! I'll take a closer look and comment soon and I'm sorry to
hear the session wasn't accepted.
Did anyone on the list submit a successful session to OKCon? Would be great
to get an advance idea of how the open science programme is shaping up!

Jenny

Hey everyone,

Thanks for the text, Stefan :)

Jenny - I have submitted stuff but got no answer whatsoever yet. So, I
guess it wasn't accepted. What is everyone else's status? :)

FYI The conference schedule has already been published:
http://okcon.org/schedule/

There isn't much room for open science, *but* the session that is there is
in the main lecture theatre which is pretty cool, so it's not like we're
shoved away as a side issue.

See also Matt Todd's satellite event after the conference.

In case any of you wanted to make OKCon but needed help with travel, you
can apply.

Message-ID: <CAD2k14NyBrZytN-Q8BGPbqgrhMRdbujO8xb82f8-i7HiqwnL4g@mail.gmail.com>

Mike Taylor has just been interviewed by Richard Poynder -
poynder.blogspot.fi/2013/07/open-access-where-are-we-what-still.html and I
think what he says is core to what the OKF interpretaion of OA is (as
expressed by the motivation of this list).

It's clear that the wider movement is floundering. Mike notes the great
increase in momentum, but also hints at the lack of coherence. Given the
bickering and worse of the last year or so it's not surprising that
genuinely motivated newcomers are perplexed.

I think it would be useful for this list to create a clear simple guide to
(Fully) open OA. The BOAI is clear but has been downgraded. We need to
state not only principles but some absolute positions. Such as Mike's "we
don't need publishers and should walk away".

I am going to try to marshal my thoughts by commenting on Mike's analysis
and have started at :
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2013/07/02/mike-taylors-brilliant-analysis-of-openaccess/
I believe more is needed, especially on rights and also on WHY we need Open
Access (I wish there was a new term and maybe we should strive for that).

Simply: The position is critical and critically balanced and the OKF can
make a significant difference.

I do agree with this. Imho, subdividing OA into Gold, Green, Libre, Gratis,
etc. is not helpful. Especially when half (or more) of the definitions
remove "open" from "open access".

There is nothing wrong with "free access" - both as a concept and a term.
Free access is nearly as important as open access, and shares the same
values, if not all of the benefits - that we need to ensure that
researchers are not prevented from getting access to published research.
But it should be clear that free is not open.

I believe more is needed, especially on rights and also on WHY we need Open
> Access (I wish there was a new term and maybe we should strive for that).

Or, seeing as "open" is well understood pretty much everywhere else it is
invoked, why not just defend the meaning and chase out the terms that
dilute it? There is no need for it - the alternatives are simply clearer.

I do my best not to use "free" - it has tons of implications in software.

"Public" access is the term that is already well used in government 
policy. It's a good word that isn't otherwise in use in "free" or "open"

Hi Nick

I'm going and I think Cameron Neylon and Michelle Brook are planning to
attend as well so see you there!

Between us I'm sure we can post back to the rest of the list or maybe throw
up a quick blog, as Nick indicated the event is by invitation but the
organisers have posted transcripts and audio for previous events so
hopefully everyone can listen at a later date - if you're interested check
http://www.foundation.org.uk/, I will try and send a reminder when the
material is posted.

I'm hoping the debate focuses more on the 'maximising use' part of the
title rather than if data should be made available in the first place. We
shall see!

Jenny

Hi,

I just joined a new lab and am under a grant from the state of Ohio which
hopes that our work generates IP for particular companies in Ohio so that
ultimately jobs are created in Ohio.

I, on the other hand, want to share my work openly as I have in the past
from preliminary to publication and beyond so that the world can benefit.

I'm wondering if anyone can point me to some specific resources, case
studies, or other things that could help bolster our arguments for openness
to the state agency that funds us. I'd ultimately like to convince the
funders that being open is in fact beneficial to their goals of improving
the economy in Ohio. I believe this in an idealistic sense, but am not sure
I can really argue that.

Any thoughts?

I'd point them to the report by Battelle
http://battelle.org/docs/default-document-library/economic_impact_of_the_human_genome_project.pdf
This showed a multiplier effect of ca 140 downstream dollars for every 1
dollar invested.
I believe this is used in Washington to justify the value of public funding
for wealth generation. The Obama government has an initiative in materials
science entitled (rather bizarrely) "Materials Genome".

Jason - I'm interested in a similar question of how to convince
universities to allow or even better support open commercialization / open
innovation.  When making your arguments, they care about money first, then
publications, then collaborative opportunities in that order.  Here's my
suggestions:

1) FUNDING: The federal government is now requiring openness for federally
funding research.
http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/05/13/how-unique-is-the-new-u-s-open-data-policy/.
 That means if states are interested in getting federal funding, they
should pursue consistent policies.

2) EXAMPLES: The best example I could find was Arduino.  Arduino is a
microcontroller platform that has become incredibly popular, and was
developed out of the Design Institute in Ivrea Italy (a university).  It is
open in it's hardware, software, and design, and is successful because it
was open and effectively created a user community who also helped design,
market, and add on to the original unit.  This enabled an Ivrea electronics
factory (one of the first in the world, but one of the last left in italy)
to continue to produce something which is otherwise almost exclusively made
in China and places where labor is cheap.

3) LOWER COST: No need to patent, license, etc. means you save at least
40k, but it's actually much more than that.  If you comb through this -
http://www.cherrycommission.org/docs/Resources/Economic_Benefits/2nd.Annual.medc_tech-transfer.assessment.pdf
you can find some data about the average cost per patent and per license,
at least for 3 unviersities in michigan during the period of this study.
Needless to say, it's expensive and while it may pay off for a few
universities who get the rare home run (for MSU, a single cancer drug
patent accounts for the vast majority of the income in their portfolio - if
not for that they'd be underwater), it does not pay off for most.

4) BRANDING/MARKETING: Open data means more people are going to see your
work - that means more people see the universities name.

5) EASIER MORE FLUID COLLABORATION --> FASTER/BETTER RESEARCH:
Patent/license restrictions slow continued research down to a standstill.
If you open up the information it should mean more papers published from
your university.

6) CONCEPT: This is the weakest argument from their perspective,
unfortunately :)  But if you're at a public university, you should mention
that it's public money and few other parts of the government are allowed to
create intellectual property for the sole benefit of a single company
(imagine if that happened in the accounting department, or the department
of education...!).

Other resources I can think of that make these kinds of arguments and have
examples:

p2pfoundation.net
sensorica.co

I recently had a discussion at MSU about open commercialization and the
recorded version is here.   It was interesting because the head of our Tech
Transfer department was there, so getting his perspective was very useful.
The link to that is here:

http://msuglobal.com/2013/07/video-open-source-technology-in-science/

I'm trying to write-up a generalized argument for why U's should support
open commercialization at P2Pfoundation.net and hope to have it up soon
(when I find the time).

Hope that helps -

Greg

These (and those pointed out in other emails) are all great examples but... there is always a but.
Jason's use case is a bit unique. A state govt wants to monetize its IP, and given how the structure of governance is set up in the US, a state govt's financial needs and constraints are unique. In fact, the same would apply anywhere else with a similar structure, not just in the US. US taxpayers pay the same federal tax no matter where they are, but people from out of Ohio don't pay tax in Ohio. Which is why we have different tuition costs for those out-of-state vs from within the state

This is a complicated problem that interests me greatly--how to reconcile "free as in speech" with making money. That is, business models that allow being open while making money. In fact, I would argue, talking about "free as in beer" both dilutes and muddies the stronger argument about "free as in speech."

Look at the subject line--it specifically asks for ideas that *open work* is a good idea, not that *'free as in beer' work* is a good idea.

I think of this as infrastructure that should remain free vs value-added layer that should be monetized, and if restricting access to it is required for monetization, well, so be it. So, for example, in a data driven project, the data are the infrastructure, and the interface to easily access it, make sense of it, analyze it, etc. are protected.

I look forward to more brainstorming on this subject, specifically targeting a funder's need to recoup or even benefit monetarily from its investment in a work while ensuring that some base portion of the work remains open for others to build upon. And, especially so in circumstances where a funder's ability to fund is restricted, but digital nature of the work ensures that its dissemination would not be so restricted.

Many thanks,

Puneet.

My issue is in the statement that "the wants to monitize IP"... the
government may want to, but I don't think that the people of Ohio really
want to.  I also don't think that the only way to generate value for the
people of Ohio is to prevent value from being co-created in other parts of
the world by using a patent.

I don't know exactly what the right answer is and I think you bring up
legitimate points, but my tendency is to continue to identify successful
ways to generate value *in any form (monetary or otherwise)* for the
creator which minimizes restriction of the flow of information.

Other than you "thinking so," is there some other evidence on which you can base the above assertion? Doesn't the government of Ohio represent the people of Ohio, at least in theory?


> I also don't think that the only way to generate value for the people of Ohio is to prevent value from being co-created in other parts of the world by using a patent.  


I also think so, but I only think so, and have no evidence to which I can point with conviction. I am not sure what exactly the answer is to the above. The best answer, of course, would be a working model whereby an entity has been able to do just the above -- created a monetary stream to continue to fund innovation while also ensuring that the basis of that innovation remains free for more innovation by others.

That said, how did you bring "patents" into the picture? I don't recall the OP talking about patents, but I could be mistaken.

No disagreement there, which is the reason I am interested in this thread. Look forward to more discussion.

Many thanks.

Patents are the traditional method of protecting IP, which I did mention
and am interested in hearing about. These companies that we are tied to in
our Ohio grant are interested in protecting the IP we generate with patents.

Puneet,

Good points. People often make the argument "If government funds the
research, then only people, companies, etc from that government's country
should benefit." This can be argued for state governments too. I have a
hard time countering that with something other than "we should help the
world and not worry about the borders".

Right you are... While you didn't mention patents specifically, you mentioned IP generally. My copyright-obsessed mind is to blame...

Indeed. The digital nature of the products we are concerned with makes for difficulties. And, arguing about the greater global good is easy when times are good, but hard to do so when times  are not so good, and esp with parties, such as state govts (or businesses, particularly start-ups) that need to find revenue streams to employ folks who create that IP in the first place. As lovely and idealistic as Jason is, he needs a real salary (I know I do), and that comes from a real govt that has, unfortunately, a real, really limited revenue stream.

This is a difficult and real problem. Not impossible, but difficult. I hope we can collectively come up with a slew of scenarios that can inspire agencies and companies with different constraints.

Hey Nick, Jenny.

I did indeed go! I would be really interested to hear the thoughts of any other attendees. I have some notes I ought to turn into a blog post... 

If others are interested we could do something like that collaboratively. Alternatively, I will try and find some time soon to get something up.

I've tweeted this out a few times now, but I thought I'd also share this
with the mailing list.

Thanks to this blog from the OA team at Oxford Uni:
http://openaccess.ox.ac.uk/cc-by-what-does-it-mean-for-scholarly-articles-3/

I've become aware of another published article explaining the history and
practicalities of creative commons licences published in a recent (2013)
book called: Perspectives on Open and Distance Learning: Open Educational
Resources: Innovation, Research and Practice
openly available from here:
http://www.col.org/resources/publications/Pages/detail.aspx?PID=446

I've cut the open book PDF down to just Norm Friesen's chapter 6 'Realising
the Open in Open Educational Resources: Practical Concerns and Solutions'
here if you want to read it right away...
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/757135/Friesen2013chap6.pdf

(all perfectly legal thanks to the CC BY-SA licence the book is published
under)


It's great to have more third-party reviewed evidence in support of the use
of CC BY for published academic materials whether OER or publications.

Best,

Ross

Hi Ross,

Many thanks for the share.I recommend reading it to everyone on these
lists.  It is a very useful publication. Open access to (scientific)
information and open education are very closely linked.

Dear All

We are delighted to announce that OKF is collaborating with the OpenUCT
Initiative at the University of Cape Town in an International Development
Research Centre funded project to develop a southern led research agenda
for open science for development.

We hope to use this as an opportunity not only to explore research into
open science but also to really push community building efforts in the
global south and identify a strong network of open science advocates and
practitioners - maybe setting up some new local open science groups along
the way!

You can read more in out project proposal:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UGgPpd7PQtYuX-mOGE58fEbXVJgohs4O_XiBrBZph8k/edit

A small group met in London last week to set the ground work for a larger
workshop in *Cape Town 11-13 September 2013* and the results of that
meeting will be available online shortly.

We hope you are as excited about this opportunity as we are and in the
spirit of the exercise we will be making both the process and outcomes as
open as possible. Therefore, if you would like to apply to participate in
the Cape Town meeting please send us a *brief* half page introduction to
yourself including answers to the following questions:


   - Why is this project of interest?


   - What expertise and experience do you bring?


   - What would you like to see come out of this project?


Preference will be given to participants from developing countries in order
to further the aims of the project and full funding will be provided.

There is a short deadline of *24 July 2013* so please spread this
invitation through your networks, particularly contacts you might have in
the global south. If selected, we will organise travel and flights as soon
as possible.

Best wishes

Jenny

Would be great to do something like this workshop to develop an agenda for open science for environmental sustainability (i.e. open sustainability science). Look forward to hearing how the Cape Town event goes.

This is impressive! Kudos to all involved.

Since science is such a large field it's great that the OKF has identified
an area where progress needs to be and can be made.

Fully, completely, and totally (did I make myself clear?) behind this wonderful initiative. We need more like this in other parts of the world, and I will be happy to do my part.

Dear all


For one week, I have started the OpenScience road trip across the US. I
stayed a few days in San Diego for the BioTechAndBeyond opening and the one
year celebration of The Green Neuroscience Lab.

I'm staying in LA for two days ( visit of the LAMakerspace,meeting with
Christopher Lee and organisation of an openscience event at USC this
evening)
I will be in SF from july 20-26th with a tight schedule! With Matthew
Senate, we organize an openscience meetup at Sudorrom on thursday 25 at
7pm. Here is the information.
https://sudoroom.org/ai1ec_event/hackyourphd-open-knowledge-meetup/?instance_id=66319I
created also an event on SF OKFN meetup group
If you live in the bay area, you are more than welcome
http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/San-Francisco-CA/966132/

Then I will drive to Seattle. Brian Glanz from the OpenScience Federation
helps me to organizing all the interviews and visit.

I will be on the east coast ( from south (Montreal) to north (Miami))
during august.

I hope to meet you during my travel.
Don't hesitate to contact me celyagd at hackyourphd.org

You can follow HackYourPhD aux States here <http://hackyourphd.org/USA>
We have developped with a french startup ubimix an openscience
collaborative map. Feel free to add you project on it!
http://maps.ubimix.com/hyphdus/
There is also a soundwall with all the interview I will record during my
journey. http://hackyourphd.org/soundwall/

FYI.

This is from the esof.eu mailing list. I haven't looked at the program.

FWIW Jenny Molloy and I participated in ESOF2008 in Barcelona on Open
Access/Data. This group put forward a proposal for ESOF2012 in Dublin but
weren't selected. (Any other involvement?)

Dear all,

I would be interested in joining an effort of this group to submit
something this time as well, but I won't hold my breath for it to be
accepted - I've proposed sessions to every ESOF so far, with those for 2006
(on public peer review) and 2010 (on open science) actually accepted.

Cheers,

Daniel

Dear all,

Thanks, Peter, for the reminder/notification :)

Daniel -- I suggest we submit a proposal on the Open Data state-of-the-art
& recommendations discussion we had in Paris last week. We'll have the time
to formalize the whole quite nicely with forthcoming events (I'll send a
separate email on these later, so hold your breath :) ).

Thoughts, anyone?

BTW it is probably worth publicly recording events like this we have
submitted to and participated in - this will give additional indication of
the vitality and scope of the group.

What Peter said, but I would even go a bit further -- It would nice to build a web page with all the submitted sessions (not just at ESOF but everywhere, perhaps tagged with the conf to which submitted, topic, etc.) even if they were not accepted, in fact, esp if they were not accepted. 

I view proposed-but-not-accepted sessions as opportunity lost to hear out what the session could have taught me, and no opportunity should be lost. Besides, they could be used to build upon and resubmit to new venues.

*Tools for Open Access Advocacy: Demystifying Hackathons*

Another free SPARC online event
Tuesday, August 6th, 2013
12:00 - 1:00PM EDT (use helpful time converter: http://bit.ly/1bSErJ6)
Registration is free, but required. Please *RSVP* by August 1st at:
http://sparc2.arl.org/civicrm/event/register?reset=1&id=120

This webcast requires both a phone dial-in and an Internet connection.

Does the very word ?Hackathon? have you crawling to the nearest corner,
with visions of computer code dancing in your head? Have you ever wondered
what exactly they are, and why you should care? Hackathons can be a great
tool, bringing together groups of people to complete a set goal using the
combination of their skills ? computer-based and otherwise. They
are not just for the technologists ? your individual expertise can be a
vital part of a ?hack.? Open Access Week is now just around the corner
(October 21-27) and a Hackathon is a great way to stir interest,
involvement, and possibly create finished projects using Open Access
content.

Our guest speaker, Brian Glanz, is the founder of the Open Science
Federation and co-founder of the American chapter of the Open
Knowledge Foundation. With both organizations, Brian has lots of experience
participating in and deploying Hackathons where Open Access content played
a critical part. For two recent examples, he points to the over 100 events
associated with http://hackforchange.org in June, and July?s
http://hack4ac.com in the scholarly publishing community.

Brian will fully explain what Hackathons are, how you deploy them, and why
we in the library community should be participating in and utilizing them.

To accommodate interest in every time zone, this 1-hour event will be
recorded and available on our website shortly afterwards.

Please join us for a lively and interactive discussion. SPARC?s Executive
Director, Heather Joseph, will be moderating questions during the webcast.
Feel free to post preliminary comments and questions for Brian on the OA
Week Website (
http://www.openaccessweek.org/profiles/blogs/hackwebcastquestions).

Really? That seems to be the assumption that everyone throws around. But so
far I have heard more complaints about "lack of reagents" than "gee, I wish
version control would be invented and there were more poorly written
journal CMSes". I am sure there's a study proving your point, I just
haven't read it yet..

The original message didn't come through to the open-science list so is
pasted below:

All,

I'm working with a team in developing a new product that will allow the
independent scientist community to publish their projects and data. I need
you to fill out a survey so we can better understand how to create this
product and direct it to the independent scientist community. The lead
researcher behind this survey is a cancer researcher in an academic setting
who has experienced pains in dealing with the traditional scientific
publication model. In response to this broken model, there are passionate,
growing communities of independent scientists that are changing how science
is done. The problem they face is the lack of a way to facilitate their
collaboration, share data, build on each other?s work, and build their
reputation among their community. To that end, please take 2 minutes to
take the following survey to understand your approach to collaborating and
communicating information about your projects.

Thanks!
Bijal Patel

Subject: [open-science] [P2PU] Open Science: An Introduction,
 a free peer-learning course about Open Access, Open Research, and Open Data
Message-ID: <CADV+XatsE6hW0wyn7rYrJhskNk1c6eGipMLyFBBBHSzAa0zwbA@mail.gmail.com>

FYI

Next month we are running a free exploratory open
course<https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/>(a
mini MOOC, if you will) as an introduction of high-level concepts in
Open Science to a variety of learners over the web, and we'd love your
support in passing the word along to interested friends.

The course content is split into three modules that introduce the basics of
Open Science in terms of Open Access, Open Data, and Open Research.  All
open content was used to build the course, which is a guiding principle of
the School of Open <http://schoolofopen.org>.  A schedule of synchronous
sessions will leverage the expertise of Open Science community
folks<https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/content/1370/>through personal
testimonies and thoughts about the importance of this area
of study. We're all going to learn a little about Open Science, in a
peer-learning environment.

For more information, please take a look at the course here:

https://p2pu.org/en/courses/5/open-science-an-introduction/

The first of four synchronous class sessions scheduled to take place on
August 6th, and we currently have around 80 participants signed up and we'd
love to have more join us and get a taste of what it means for science to
be open. *Signups are open until August 4th.*

The first class session will be next week, *Tuesday August 6th at 11:00amPDT
*. We appreciate your sharing this info with friends in your networks!

Message-ID: <51F84805.8040707@gmx.at>

hello,

the open science projekt (http://openscience.alpine-geckos.at) is
thinking now for quite a while about a proper name. after long
discussion, we now have found a favorite and wanted to ask the community
about your opinion.

it is openscienceASAP and it means Open Science as a Practice, but also
has the double meaning with as soon of possible of course, which should
lead to some attention. the goal of the project is, to give a platform
to do everything around open science, especially write about it and be
the hub in between all the other services for an open scientific
workflow. This means also projects around open science, like software
dev or sharing knowledge and experiences from courses.

so, would be very happy about some feedback, also about the idea behind
it and if you know any interesting sources for this. Basically, it's the
development of a wordpress theme for a multiuser installation with use
of many different APIs and plugins.

cheers, stefan

Dear Stefan,

I don't know how important this is for you, but ASAP is also the name of
the Accelerating Science Award Program (ASAP), which recognizes the use of
scientific research, published through Open Access, that has led to
innovations in any field that benefit society (sponsored by 27
organizations, including major sponsors Public Library of Science (PLOS),
Wellcome Trust and Google): http://asap.plos.org/. I am worried that it
might create some confusions between your project and this award.

Best wishes,
Iryna
