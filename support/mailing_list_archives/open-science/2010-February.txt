Message-ID: <735C9BD8-AD05-4574-AFAB-BE5F23168A53@okfn.org>

Hello,
Can I ask for any news/information and OKF relevant updates you may have, to include in the upcoming OKF newsletter, be sent my way?

This might be an item relevant to 'in brief' news, ie. a couple of sentences synopsis is fine; or it may be more comprehensive information about OKF recent activities (eg. the COMMUNIA workshop held in Luxembourg) or recent open data activities and initiatives you've been involved in ? in which case send me full details or URLS so I can re-write/edit/summarise as appropriate.

The more information the better: so send me what you've got in the first instance (no matter how small/insignificant an activity/outcome it may seem to be) so it can be whittled down from there. As usual, newly-discovered and useful URL/links to showcase are also appreciated.

Please send to me by: the week beginning Monday 22nd February in order to ensure inclusion.


Thanks!

Hi all,

We're pleased to announce the Panton Principles for Open Data in Science:

  http://blog.okfn.org/2010/02/19/launch-of-the-panton-principles-for-open-data-in-science/
  http://www.pantonprinciples.org/

The Panton Principles were authored by Peter Murray-Rust, Cameron
Neylon, Rufus Pollock and John Wilbanks at the Panton Arms on Panton
Street in Cambridge, UK - with input from the Working Group on Open
Data in Science.

You can endorse the principles at:

  http://www.pantonprinciples.org/endorse

We'd be most grateful for any help disseminating the principles - by
blogging, microblogging, forwarding to relevant colleagues and so
forth.

The 'Is It Open Data?' service, which allows anyone to make and
publicly record enquiries about the openness of (scientific) datasets,
is also now live at:

  http://www.isitopendata.org/

All the best,

Jonathan,
This is great - very well done. I intend to publicly sign the Principles in
my presentation at Science Commons on Saturday. Will be meeting with Cameron
there (and presumably this evening)?

Peter and all,

that's a very good idea. I gave it a go via
http://twitter.com/EvoMRI/status/9335405125 - didn't find you on Twitter.

Thanks for the great work!

Is there any kind of promotion material ready, like posters we can
print and put up at public places at our universities?

Hi Jonathan,

I have been monitoring the responses on FriendFeed [0], and some are
keen to use the OpenData icons. However, the icons seem fine with
requirement 1 and 3, they do not really encourage people to apply
principle 2 and 4. Just an observation...

Second thing is a request about the HTML of the endorsement field...
right now, all form fields are put into one <span class="signature">
element... might three fields perhaps be split up into separate <span>
elements, perhaps like:

<span class='signature'><span class='name'>Egon Willighagen</span>,
<span class='affiliation'>Uppsala University</span>, <span
class='country'>Sweden</span></span>

I would even go as far to use RDFa and FOAF for these bits of information:

<span xmlns:foaf="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/" class='signature'
typeof="foaf.Person"><span rel='foaf:name'>Egon Willighagen</span>,
<span class='affiliation'>Uppsala University</span>, <span
rel='foaf:based_near'>Sweden</span></span>

That would very much make it more mashup-able, more machine readable,
and those mashups in turn would be good show cases of what Open Data
is really about: reuse. (Not sure how to fit the affiliation into
foaf.)

Agreed - OKD compliance is necessary but not sufficient for compliance
with Panton Principles. OKD takes for granted that people will use a
license appropriate for material they are licensing.

We're currently planning on adding this kind of material to
opendefinition.org. E.g. a bit like material and diagrams in our
recent Unlocking the Potential of Aid Information report:

  http://www.unlockingaid.info/1/1-1/
  http://www.unlockingaid.info/1/1-2/
  http://www.unlockingaid.info/appendix/i/

Re: public domain we could have a 'Panton Principles' button, or
indeed a 'public domain' button in a similar style. Would be great if
someone would be willing to help with this! Image files are at:

http://m.okfn.org/images/ok_buttons/

We're currently using Wordpress Petition plugin [1] which could
certainly be improved upon. We'd love if someone was willing to have a
look at this and implement some of the things you've mentioned!

Do you think it would be difficult to modify?

All the best,

Jonathan

Doesn't look difficult...

                       if ( $comments_enabled == 1 && $row->comment != "") {
                                $comment = stripslashes($row->comment);
                                # The following format strings can be
editted if you wish. For instance:
                                # $sub_form  .=
sprintf("<tr><td>%s</td><td>%s</td><td>%s</td></tr>",$the_name,$fields,$comment);
                                $return  .= sprintf("<p><span
class='signature'>%s,
%s<br/>%s</span></p>",$the_name,$fields,$comment);
                        } else {
                                $return  .= sprintf("<p><span
class='signature'>%s, %s</span></p>",$the_name,$fields);
                        }

the culprit is in $fields =
fcpetition_prettyvalues(unserialize(base64_decode($row->fields)),$petition);

Cannot do it in 5 minutes, but I'll check tonite... don't have
wordpress installed, so will need some bit extra for testing...

Hi all,

We're pleased to announce the Panton Principles for Open Data in Science:

  http://blog.okfn.org/2010/02/19/launch-of-the-panton-principles-for-open-data-in-science/
  http://www.pantonprinciples.org/

The Panton Principles were authored by Peter Murray-Rust, Cameron
Neylon, Rufus Pollock and John Wilbanks at the Panton Arms on Panton
Street in Cambridge, UK - with input from the Working Group on Open
Data in Science.

You can endorse the principles at:

  http://www.pantonprinciples.org/endorse

We'd be most grateful for any help disseminating the principles - by
blogging, microblogging, forwarding to relevant colleagues and so
forth.

The 'Is It Open Data?' service, which allows anyone to make and
publicly record enquiries about the openness of (scientific) datasets,
is also now live at:

  http://www.isitopendata.org/

All the best,

Blogged. As will not surprise folks, I focused on the importance of CC and
OKF coming to agreement :-)

jtw

http://scienceblogs.com/commonknowledge/2010/02/reaching_agreement_on_the_publ.php

Today marked the public announcement of a set of principles on how to treat
data, from a legal context, in the sciences. Called the Panton
Principles<http://pantonprinciples.org/>,
they were negotiated over the summer between myself, Rufus
Pollock<http://www.rufuspollock.org/about/>
, Cameron Neylon <http://blog.openwetware.org/scienceintheopen/>, and Peter
Murray-Rust <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Murray-Rust>. If you're too
busy to read them directly, here's the gist: publicly funded science data
should be in the public domain, full stop.

If you know me and my work, this is nothing new. We have been saying
this<http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/7917> since
late 2007. I've already gotten a dozen emails asking me why this is
newsworthy, when it's actually a less normative version of the Science
Commons protocol for open access to
data<http://sciencecommons.org/projects/publishing/open-access-data-protocol/>
(we
used words like "must" and "must not" instead of the "should" and "should
not" of the principles).

It's newsworthy to me because it represents a ratification of the ideals
embodied in the protocol by two key groups of stakeholders. First, real
scientists - Cameron and Peter are two of the most important working
scientists in the open science movement. Getting real scientists into the
fold, endorsing the importance of the public domain, is essential. They're
also working in the UK, which has some copyright issues around data that can
complicate things in a way we forget about here in the post-colonial
Americas.

Second, it's newsworthy because Rufus and I both signed it. Rufus helped to
start the Open Knowledge Foundation <http://okfn.org/>, and he's an
important scholar of the public domain. We're in many ways in the same
fraternity - we care about "open" deeply, and we want the commons to scale
and grow, because we believe in its role in innovation and
creation...indeed, in its role in humanity.

But we're on different sides of a passionate debate about data and licenses.
I'm not going to recapitulate it here, you can find it in the googles if you
want. Suffice to say we have argued about the role of the public domain as a
first principle in general for data, as opposed to the specifics of data in
public funded science. But for both of us to sign onto something like this
means that even in the midst of heated argument we can find common ground -
public money should mean public science, no licenses, no controls on
innovation and reuse, globally.

It's important for the science part. It's also a good lesson, I hope, that
even those of us who find themselves on opposite sides of arguments inside
open are usually fighting for the same overall goals. I'll keep arguing for
my points, and Rufus will keep arguing for his, but that should never keep
us from remembering the truly common goals we share inside the movement. I'm
proud to be a part of it.

Deepest apologies for the 0's in the output once! String concatenation
is with '.' not with '+' as I am used to in Java :(

But I hacked in some <span> elements, so you can now use the xpath
query //span[@class='signature']/span[@class='Country']/text() and
some linux command line magic:

wget -O endorsed.html http://pantonprinciples.org/endorse...; xpath -q
-e "//span[@class='signature']/span[@class='Country']/text()"
endorsed.html | sort | uniq -c

to get:

      1 Australia
      1 Canada
      1 Catalonia
      2 Espa?a
      2 France
      5 Germany
      1 Greece
      1 Italy
      1 Netherlands
      1 Norway
      1 Poland
      1 Slovenia
      1 Sweden
      1 Switzerland
      1 The Netherlands
      8 UK
      1 U.K.
      1 United Kingdom
      1 United States of America
      9 USA

The FOAF XHTML+RDFa is even trickier as WordPress does not produce
XHTML pages... that's not something I like to fiddle with... just
hacking the plugin gave me enough sweating...

I've now met Lisa - we've had lunch with Lee (also copied). The good news is
that there will probably be 2 recordings of this - one routed through MS and
UWash and the other an independent video stream by an enthusiast (whose name
I'll post when I have it). I think this is a seminal meeting from which both
SC and OKF take considerable credit and I'm hoping we can get it widely
reported ...  I bounced this off Lisa at lunch. Anyone with friendly science
journalists is welcome to let them know.

Cameron and I will divvy up the Panton material - I will also show IsItOpen
but don't have time to make any requests during the talk. However I had
earlier tried it out on a friendly publisher and got a positive reply.

There'll be a good physical attendence. I haven't asked but I assume it will
be tweeted

After posting on the principles in some mailing lists, I got replies
from the social sciences/ humanities/ medical corner in which concerns
were raised about the lack of definition of "data" in the principles,
and about a possible lack of applicability to their fields,
essentially because of privacy concerns for subjects/ patients.
Perhaps you can address these points when you talk about the subject?

Thanks!

Daniel,
This is an extremely valid point. My understanding is that it best covered
by "community norms". At present I see the situation as:
* any data which is "Open Data" is necessarily publicly visible so there is
no additional release of information.
* it is therefore important for an author to unedrstand the community norms
relating to the release of this information
* data in public view are tecnically crawable and analysable by bots. It is
true that some bot-owners may be dissauaded by the current lack of clarity
on rights and hold back from indexing this. However it is likley that this
is already repeatedly crawled by large search engines (some of which
currently crawl private information as well).

So I don't see that Open Data per se gives any less privacy. Of course if a
community or author applies Open Data to material that is normally regarded
as private this is a problem. But that breach of privacy is not really
dependent on Open Data - but a poorly thought out publication policy.

I would add slightly to this. The point of the PP was for it to apply after
the decision to publish the data has been made. We completely sidestep the
issue of when it should be published. As Peter says, privacy is an issue
with the decision to publish, not any decision about how that data is made
available. Note that the PP makes no comment at all as to when, or even if,
data should be published.

The issue of the definition of data is a fair one, but it is essentially
impossible to define in a way that will capture all the different
definitions that people want. We can count angels till the cows come home,
or we could rely on legal definitions (which would be inconsistent). I?m
pretty happy with ?I know it when I see it?. This is not supposed to be a
legal code, this is supposed to be statement of principle.

Cheers

Cameron

Thank you, Peter and Cameron. Next step then would be some framework
for when and if data should be made available.
Anyone working on this?

Would it be possible to have the Country field selected by drop-down
menu? Then totals would be easier to generate, without needing to
convert between U.K. and UK, or USA and United States.

Thanks everyone for preparing this articulate summary of the issue,
with a clear course of action. Going to add my endorsement now!

Egon,

Just wondered if - after looking at the code - you have any sense of
how difficult it would be to automatically display the number of
people that have endorsed the Panton Principles somewhere on the site?

Hi,

Just wonder if anyone has any cunning ideas about how we can continue
to get the word out about the Panton Principles?

Would be especially good if anyone had suggestions for people at OA
friendly science publications that we could contact! Or even at tech
news sites (Slashdot, Wired, ...).

Also would much appreciate any further blogging, microblogging,
forwarding, etc.!

All the best,

Apologies for the belated reply. Some thoughts:

As someone passionate about this but new to the community and its inner
workings, only after reading John's post about why this is significant did I
really get a better sense of, well why this is significant. I appreciate now
that the two big players in this space are essentially agreeing to some
common ground, which is necessary for moving forward. Hooray!

As a scientists, if I work with a data set, I'll look at this and say,
great, yes, I agree-- and then move on. The real question is how to make
this actionable. For example, can we provide a microformat of some kind for
data sets? Something that includes a wrapper for links to data with license
info? But then that separates the license info from the data, which is
suboptimal. That said, software licenses are simply distributed "with"
software, and not necessarily "inside" it. So, perhaps that's acceptable.

Could something like a code snippet/microformat use a webhook (web callback)
that calls back to a site such as CKAN or infochimps and registers it in
their database? This would not prevent scientists from hosting their data
wherever else they want, but would provide a similar function to
arxiv.org(and an equally important mirroring function, which I
assume/gather CKAN
already does?). And one could say that regardless of where else it is
hosted, if it's in these data registries, then that suffices to meet the
criteria. This would also make it super easy for scientists to participate.

I'm sure there's many other, probably better, ways to do it, this is just
one thought. And of course we need the concrete ideas before implementation
of those ideas can occur, so definitely agreed this is a great start! Thanks
for humouring the n00b, and apologies if this has all been covered before.

Are there interests/plans for going further into the "operationalization"
realm?

Speculative question: what would a microformat, or family of
microformats for open science look like? What pattern language(s)--to
borrow from Christopher Alexander--is(are) in play here?

Many microformats are already out there. I think a good idea would be
to figure out (1) what formats are already out there, (2) what the
pain points are in publishing scientific data *as well as*
supplementary information in standard ways, and (3) what people don't
tend to know about but should, or don't use but should (like if it's
hard or painful, etc).

I have lately become a huge fan of YAML, JSON, etc., but to each his
own (srsly). At the very least, in many situations I would be happy
with XML, which is a drastic improvement over binary-encoded files and
proprietary data formats.

Thanks for your suggestion, Dharma! Do you have any ideas about any
particular listservs that might be good to contact? I guess in the UK
this might include several of the JISCmail lists.

In particular it would be good if people could posts to lists they are
on for their research (where relevant!).

I've set up a Google Docs to post ideas for publicising and for
keeping track of who has contacted who:

?https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0Ams8fpz2_77XdE1NNnpjVDYwU2dsdzdLRkZQZmlGaFE&hl=en

Also anyone interested in helping with a nice 'Panton Principles'
button or similar so people can display endorsement on their website?

All the best,

Jonathan

There's already some room in the spec for versions of the data
packages, but at the moment I don't know whether or not the data
packages themselves are git, mercurial or some other dcvs
repositories.

For the time being, I am waiting on their response on that front. In
particular, I am most interested in material and chemical data and
other data that can be used to help populate SKDB, but- on the other
hand- broad data like politics, sports statistics, etc., doesn't
necessarily fit into the grand scheme of SKDB. We'll see.. I'm hoping
to hear back from Rufus or Jonathan.

> of which version?

Right now, SKDB packages are downloaded into ~/.skdb/packages/ but
this can be configured in the config.yaml file in the base directory
of SKDB. Presumably, when you want to share with a single individual,
you'd just do normal dcvs transfer stuff and give them access to pull
the file from you (or you to push it); the web server, on the other
hand, provides another option for users to submit and push
repositories on their own, much like the case with gitorious, github,
etc.

I would only ask not using the PP in a circle, which is very close to the
Creative Commons trademarks.

We tend to prefer RDFa over microformats, as it is infinitely more scalable.

Also, I would caution against badging the principles without adding *legal*
information to data. Self-asserting the principles does not actually comply
with the principles - only the use of an unambiguous legal tool opens up the
principles. This is an essential point. You will also want to think about
the importance of the data moving around the web without the legal
information, which is the reality of how data practice works. Do you want to
integrate the information into the data set itself, or point everyone back
to the page from which the data first came? Do you want to version the data?
All of this is pretty essential to the data being not just legally available
but useful in the future and should be part of the metadata.

There is basic support for CC0 RDFa in the CC0 webservice at
http://api.creativecommons.org/rest/dev/ and the CC Rights Expression
Language spec submitted to the W3C provides support for this as well, for at
least CC legal tools. The API documentation generally is at
http://api.creativecommons.org/rest/dev/, the CC RDFa docs at
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/RDFa and the CC REL spec is at
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Ccrel

I have started to bounce the idea of "Panton Discussions" where we invite
someone to the Panton Arms and record/blog a discussion about Open Data. If
we get along publishers / editors then they might like to report the
discussion in their own organs or websites. A regular "Panton Discussions"
series could have its own momentum. The range of people could be wide and
there are already several on the endorsers list who would be very
interesting to talk and record. Ideally the dicussants should be present in
the Arms, but I can see occasional cases where we interview over Skype or
whatever.

I am an advocate of just adding the button. I understand and support the
work on legal agreements but the scientist must be freed from making
decisions about these as far as possible. I  (or my colleagues - human and
otherwise) have created about 150,000 buttons:

http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/

and it would be worse if we we hadn't. That data is "Open Data". It points
to the OKD page and if Rufus/John want to refine what is on that page,
great. It's a meta statement.

There's a greater danger that I blow myself up in the laboratory than that
the "Open Data" button misfires. I'll worry about the former.

Hi Brian,

thanks for getting this started. A few observations:
-The PP in the circle being close to the CC logo is something that I
actually like and which you probably intended, but I understand that John
may have reservations on this.
- PP has too many possible meanings (e.g. those listed at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pp ), which would dilute the clarity of the
message.
- Instead of the circles fading out in spikes, I would actually prefer somet
kind of meshing gear, to emphasize the reuse aspect. Demo at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gears_animation.gif .
- Red may not be the best colour to choose for something people are intended
to support. Green would fit well in this respect, and it could probably
provide for some spill over from the Green OA movement (in which
repositories also feature prominently).

Daniel

I like this idea, Peter, and given that we already had more online
participants than people who attended in person ( http://ff.im/ghC0X
), such a series of events may well start off with a sizable audience
worldwide.

It would look like XHTML+RDFa, which has more expressive power and is
more accurate. Now, being in the RDF world, it would be able to use
any of the scientific domain ontologies being worked on around the
world.

Sorry to be pedantic here, but if you do not use a legal tool, you are
not in compliance with the principles. In the absence of a legal tool
the data *are not open* by default, especially in the uk and the eu.
These principles will mean very little if the data they attach to are
not legally open.

I have seen people claim data as OpenData... but I have too been so so
comfortable using this data, because of the lack of standardized
waiver (/license)... I endorse PP because it indeed strongly
encourages to do that.

I would also say that just claiming OpenData without waiver is not
quite in compliance with the principles... at least, that's how I read
them.

Right. The basic way datapkg works is that it expects:

a) some basic metadata (name, title, version etc) -- most of this is
optional though recommended
b) a "download url" (or possibly multiple ones ...)

This is very similar (nothing accidental here!) to the way things like
the python package index work (and associated tools like easy_install
or pip). This download url, can point either to a distribution
(specially formatted tar.gz or zip) or, nowadays, just a svn, git or
mercurial repo (depending the plugins). This is a little different
from, say, Debian where you really only ever have one download url and
its guaranteed to work.

I think the more flexible method is probably a must for us given the
current very non-standardized set up for data and hence we've gone for
a simple download_url approach with extensibility via plugins (the
default is just to try retrieve the url -- plugins could alter this
by, for example, realizing the url represents a vcs and performing the
relevant checkout).

Regards,

Rufus

I agree with John that in order to be compliant (as stated in the
principles) data publishers should use a legal tool like CC0 or PDDL
or have some other explicit legal statement about the data. Just
linking to the Panton Principles is not sufficient to show that data
is open. It is equivalent someone wearing a badge saying 'I support
vegetarianism' - which does not say whether or not the person wearing
it is a vegetarian.

Perhaps it could be useful to have a brief guide to making data open
using existing legal tools on Panton Principles site? I.e. CC0/PDDL?
(Which is of course not to say that there aren't other ways of putting
things in public domain...)

All the best,

Jonathan

These are great, Brian! Many thanks for all of your effort in putting
these together!

I particularly like the Panton Principles web button.

Shall I put this up on the website - with code to link to principles?
What do people think?

All the best,

Big plus one here!

This is a great idea Peter! What do we need to move forward on this?
Perhaps we could start by putting together a list of people we'd like
to talk to? Would you be happy to lead the discussions?

Also I wonder whether it could be worth getting hold of a flip cam for this?

I will post the announcement on the comparative neuroanatomy group on Ning.
Anyone interested in writing a miniblog to post there? It would be
interesting to see if anyone responds to that , and how.
Allso, just toyed with a 'button idea' (attached, just a quick idea). Kept
thiniking that the mirrored P's look like a key handle, then thought of
unlock the data and then thought it makes a nice complement to the OA lock.
(the words Panton Principles morphing into the key or viceversa would also
make a nice and easy animation for presentations too).

Not any more than an artist should be free to just create art or a  
musician to just create music without worrying about the crimes being  
committed because she copied a fragment of music or a few pixels of an  
artwork. The internet changed everything... never before has it been  
possible to commit so many crimes with just a click of a mouse button.  
Everyone, yes, even the scientists, have to now be responsible and  
concerned about the legal ramifications of using and letting others  
use their data.

Think of PP as the guiding principles that lead you to release your  
data as completely open, free of all encumbrances. Think of CC0 (or  
PD) as a mark of quality that tells others that the specific dataset  
they are about to use or copy is indeed free of all encumbrances. And  
that proclamation has to be embedded in the data so that the two, the  
data and its use conditions, travel together. Embedding the metadata  
in RDFa converges toward a standard, allowing us to leverage other  
technologies and communities.

Finally, I don't want to download data based on a principle, then  
realize that I have to go to another web page which tells me what I  
can or cannot do with that data (remember, just recently you were  
depending on an existing web page working because you had to give a  
demonstration, but it was hiccuping? embedding the metadata in the  
data ensures fewer moving parts, hence fewer points of failure).

In an age where we routinely do unnecessarily complicated things,  
nothing could be simpler than adding a CC0 waiver and a button to our  
data. There is no decision-making. The decision has already been made  
because you, I and others agreed to the Panton Principles.

OK - can we have a button which automatically applies a licence to the data?
Perhaps a different colour. As we discussed it is often difficult to
actually attach a licence to many data items. If the button links to a copy
of a licence that should be OK. I use a CC button which links to a licence
and I assume that is OK, so is it not just a matter of editing what is under
the button. If it's harder than that then Opendata will be too hard.

Message-ID: <54ca21751002240456p1fb15254x1c42f2611ce19d8@mail.gmail.com>

For a *long* time we've been thinking about CKAN group for open data in science.

Would be great to have opinions on whether we should have a general
'open data in science' group, e.g. at:

  http://ckan.net/group/science

Or whether it would be good to have this 'per discipline'? For now I'm
leaning towards a single group with a view to branching as and when
necessary.

If I set up a 'science' group - would anyone be interested in helping
to bootstrap/maintain this? E.g. we have a load of packages listed at:

All,

There is a scientific literature of "socio-technical transition", and  
that is what the OKF is engaged in. You are trying to change a  
"regime", so you need to learn how regimes are vulnerable, and then  
you need to exploit those vulnerabilities.

A regime is vulnerable to landscape changes. For example, in most  
science domains: technology is getting cheaper; data is expensive to  
produce but cheap to store and publish; publish/discover methods are  
advancing  through structured metadata, unstructured search engine  
searches, and the Semantic Web; and social relations are changing due  
to social networking and other influences.  Meanwhile, "openness" is  
advancing as a value, through open source, open standards, etc. And  
transparency is advancing as a value; note the response to  
Climategate. All these landscape changes put pressure on the Academy  
to change its business practices.

A regime is vulnerable to internal misalignment among actors ? early  
adopters, change agents, mavens, etc. Some of the actors you want to  
see embrace open science are science funders, science associations and  
science publishers.

A regime is vulnerable to niche advances in the form of socio- 
technical prototypes (such as testbeds, pilot projects,  
interoperability experiments, and new web services such as eCAT,  
Parallel Archive and WolframAlpha) which:
-- Provide evidence to support later, larger actions
-- Test options, knowing some will fail
-- Pursue ambitious goals
-- Are large enough to yield observable results, but small enough to  
be affordable
-- Are designed to assess complex, socio-technical interactions
-- Assist knowledge diffusion by providing a visible model
-- Are created from scratch or by adapting another project

(I adapted the above from a presentation by Gordon Thompson at a Marsh  
Institute & Kasperson Library Seminar at Clark University 8 October  
2009. His talk was about energy system regime change and climate. He  
provided references, but I'm not enough of a scholar to go digging for  
them.)

I see vulnerabilities of the old geospatial technology regime being  
addressed in OGC activities such as the Ocean Science Interoperability  
Experiment II. Note that OGC activities are tackling technical  
interoperability issues that, incidentally, must be resolved if open  
access is to become the norm. It is NOT in the OGC's mission to  
address licensing issues, except that the Geo Rights Management  
Working Group is developing ways to convey data rights information  
from Web service to Web service. The GeoRM WG is, I would say, "rights  
agnostic", though its members have a range of opinions.

I think it is important for groups such as yours to understand the  
differences -- and similarities and synergies -- between open source,  
open standards and open access.

I would also suggest that the ?four whos? questions (See "The Art of  
Systems Architecting" by Mark W. Maier and Eberhardt Rechtin) need to  
be answered if a new open data regime is to displace the old regime:  
Who benefits (in dollars and that other currency of science,  
prestige)? Who pays? Who provides? and, as the case may be, Who loses?

I will be difficult and agree with both John and Peter :-)

I think we need two things. Some very simple instructions and/or a service
for quickly generating the relevant graphic(s) and markup. Text instructions
on the PP page and knock up a web service somewhere else? The key is to make
it as easy as possible and to not confuse people with issues of the
difference between buttons, legal waivers, and badges.

Secondly to look at where we could start baking this into processes to
provide good examples of practice. Is it for example possible to (as an
option of course) bake a licence into ATOM feeds in Clarion for instance? I
was talking with Andrew from the SAGE project yesterday about capturing
processes and release data formats so maybe this is another good place where
we could bake the addition of appropriate buttons and legal terms into the
analysis process?

Also agree with John that avoiding letters in circles is a good idea but for
a slightly different reason. The circle references copyright and that is one
reference I think we want to avoid as far as possible. As an aside I find it
interesting that everyone makes the connection between "letters in circle"
and creative commons reference rather than to copyright. This is great
progress to me!

Cheers

Cameron

We added this CC0 logo and license

style="text-decoration:none;">
    <img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/zero/1.0/88x31.png" border="0"

to the nav bar on the ONSC wiki
http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/

and to the results of any solubility search:
http://old.oru.edu/cccda/sl/solubility/allsolvents.php?solute=benzoic%2520acid

Does this meet the requirements for machine readability of CC0 intent?

Jean-Claude,

Seems like you didn't copy the entire code fragment from the CC0  
chooser. If you had, the above would have looked like so

<p xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" xmlns:vcard="http://www.w3.org/2001/vcard-rdf/3.0# 
"> <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/ 
" style="text-decoration:none;"> <img src="http://i.creativecommons.org/l/zero/1.0/88x31.png 
" border="0" alt="CC0" /> </a> <br /> To the extent possible under  
law, <a href="http://onschallenge.wikispaces.com/"  
rel="dct:publisher"><span property="dct:title">Jean-Claude</span></a>  
has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to <span  
property="dct:title">ONS Challenge</span>. </p>

Note: I am using your name and your resource name only for illustration.

The XML namespace declaration tells a parser that "the terms we are  
going to use here are as per their meaning established by the Dublin  
Core initiative." See http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml

This ensures that when you say poh-tah-toh and I say poh-tay-toh, we  
don't call the whole thing off.

Once the parser has established that we are talking DC-speak, which  
will henceforth (for the scope of this session) be referred to by the  
alias 'dct', it knows exactly what you mean by dct:publisher and  
dct:title, etc.

Now, I understand that you may not want to pollute your lovely looking  
navbar with all the text that will show up. No problem -- just put the  
stuff you don't want humans to see as an html comment. A source code  
parser will still be able to crack the meaning out, and your web page  
will still look lovely. The point is, don't omit the code, as that is  
what adds the machine-readable intelligence to the license waiver.

Hope that helps.

I tried to use the entire code generated by

But it kept throwing an HTML error code:
The HTML you have entered is not valid HTML: No declaration for attribute

This is the code:

  To the extent possible under law, <a href="

Yes, that is a problem, and not just because it is not valid HTML. It  
doesn't seem to be valid XHTML+RDFa as well, as per the validator at http://validator.w3.org/check

Interestingly, W3C's recommended RDFa syntax at http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/ 
  also doesn't seem to pass W3C's validator.

So, now what to do? First, let's inform CC that this is an issue. I am  
sending them an email, but you should also send one to explain the  
problem and add to the feedback.

Second, perhaps the best option may be to put the entire CC0 code in  
comments, and only put valid markup visible to the validator.

Of course, you could just ignore the errors and proceed merrily, but  
that is not right. I think our feedback should help CC fix this or at  
least clarify what DOCTYPE we need to use in order to generate RDFa  
markup that passes the validator 100%. This needs to be even more easy  
and clear.

Many thanks,

A few points: yes I had deliberately remixed CC and kin for the option 'PP
in the circle'.

15-pixel-high web buttons are almost a graphic standard. Many footers,
sidebars, signatures, and other web parts are designed for them. It's
sensible and appropriate for PP. Whatever other graphics everyone likes, as
a usability guy myself I vote for buttons at least as an alternative. I have
attached another round of graphics, again as .7z and .zip and will again
insert some below. I also love Fabiana's PP keys, unlocking data and will
get to that in a moment.

Color: The typeface and version of red I had worked with in the first round
were from http://pantonprinciples.org and I take it, from Panton Arms
itself. It makes sense to visually match other OKFN buttons which might be
used concurrently, one of which is "red and green" but not PP red. To
Daniel's idea of using green, I agree except that even sites like
http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/ and http://www.soros.org/openaccess et al.
use several different greens to represent Green OA. If there is a green most
apt, I suppose that is the color named "green" in the W3C HTML and CSS
standards, i.e. #008000 or (R, G, B) of (0, 128, 0).

For web buttons then: whether to favor matching the OKFN set, Panton Arms'
red, or standard green? Perhaps offer all. By OKFN's file naming convention
and the above details the buttons are:

[image:
?ui=2&view=att&th=1270381f0b1437f1&attid=0.1&disp=attd&realattid=ii_1270381f0b1437f1&zw]
pp_95x15_blue.PNG

?ui=2&view=att&th=1270382cbfd3f2cb&attid=0.1&disp=attd&realattid=ii_1270382cbfd3f2cb&zw]
pp_95x15_red.PNG -- the red used by PP

[image:
?ui=2&view=att&th=12703832eedda23c&attid=0.1&disp=attd&realattid=ii_12703832eedda23c&zw]
pp_95x15_green.PNG -- "green" say the W3C

Back to Fabiana's keys. We might avoid the circle, but the symbol struck me.
If the buttons above are a minimum impact, Web standard sort of graphic, an
alternative badge might be more decorative. I thought of Panton Arms again
and put Fabiana's graphic in a similarly proportioned shield:

[image:
?ui=2&view=att&th=12703a7f1cf63027&attid=0.1&disp=attd&realattid=ii_12703a7f1cf63027&zw]
or
without the words, [image:
?ui=2&view=att&th=12703bdd2e2c7a71&attid=0.1&disp=attd&realattid=ii_12703bdd2e2c7a71&zw]
except
it makes me think "mustachioed man in glasses" which I hadn't thought with
the words. BG

Remixing a log is actually not remix, but a trademark issue. The cc
marks carry a very specific meaning - some rights reserved via
standardized copyright licenses, internationally - that is totallly
different from panton, which is not a cc project. even the creative
commons materials transfer agreements don't carry the
double-letters-in-a-circle mark.

trademark integrity is realy important in remix culture. this is why
it is important to distinguish copyrights from other ip rights - data
rights and copyrights are where remix authority and rights are
essential, not trademarks. otherwise you and i would be able to market
our own soda pop as "coke" and call it remix...

Puneet,
Until the issue gets resolved will putting this allow for automatic
discovery of CC0 licensed content?

I am skating on thin ice here, but my understanding is that it won't  
be enough. The 'rel' attribute indicates a relationship between your  
document and the linked-to document, declaring the linked document to  
be a "license." The other bits that you are omitting, actually allow  
extracting terms such as 'publisher' and 'title' from your  
declaration. Note that if one (a human being or a program) follows the  
a href, they land up at the CC0 waiver page where they can get an  
earful re. the CC0 waiver, but have no clue as to the entity that  
actually used that waiver.

I have sent a query to CC, and I suggest you do so as well. Hopefully  
we will have this resolved rapidly. In the meantime, as I said, just  
put the whole bit inside HTML comments, with only the CC0 badge  
showing up and going through the validator.

I have talked with Rufus and we have converged on attaching a form of words
with the button which is simple and I think satisfies our various concerns.
I need something which is almost trivial to implement; others need something
which is legally acceptable. We've agreed Rufus will post it to make sure
it's correct.

Hi Peter,

I'll second this idea. I think we can even make a streaming of the
event online, so we can have more people partecipating.

Of course we need to try and see if it works properly.

Just to keep you all updated. I received a reply from the intrepid  
coder at CC who is looking into the issue, and will let me (us) know  
as soon as there is a fix. This is quality service, I must say rather  
approvingly and admiringly.

Puneet.

Thanks to Puneet and Jean-Claude for providing feedback on the
XHTML+RDFa generated by the CC0 chooser.  I've fixed a bug in that code,
and updated the site.

You can find an example of a page with the markup pasted in (and the
appropriate doctype, etc) that validates at
http://labs.creativecommons.org/~nathan/validation_test.html.

Regards,

Nathan

Just to add a bit of additional information: the *bare minimum* is
rel="license"; that says "this resource is made available under the
linked legal tool".  We think adding information about the work,
publisher, and territory adds additional value and clarity.  For
example, it provides easy to find information if someone wants to cite
use of your work.

Actually putting it in an HTML comment is not advised.  Parsers can and
do throw those away.  If you don't want it to show up for users, you can
always use CSS to hide it.

Let us know if you have any more questions.

Nathan

Hi,

Jonathan. Following the virtual meeting I attended on Tuesday,
I can now confirm that I have, as of tonight, alerted key contacts at 
PLoS/BMC/Nature and just there, DOAJ about the PP in terms of
both spreading the word and endorsing it. 

I hope this might be of some assistance...

Best,

Hi,
 
Just wonder if anyone has any cunning ideas about how we can continue
to get the word out about the Panton Principles?
 
Would be especially good if anyone had suggestions for people at OA
friendly science publications that we could contact! Or even at tech
news sites (Slashdot, Wired, ...).
 
Also would much appreciate any further blogging, microblogging,
forwarding, etc.!
 
All the best,

To be clear, if there is no legal tool attached, my position is that the
principles are not met. If you can't unambiguously tell that the data is
legally open, then the data is closed. Full stop. If it's in the EU, or the
UK, it's definitely closed. PDDL, CC0, handwritten note waiving rights,
whatever works. But in the absence of a pre-granted right to the user, it's
not open data.

The point of the principles was to come to consensus about what open data
was. Legal uncertainty violates every principle we have at Creative Commons
about open data.

I hate to be dogmatic, but this is very important. Please copy me on any
such text so I can evaluate it. If PP turns into making assertions about PD
status that aren't backed by legal reality, I will be forced to consider
un-signing.

What we are trying to do is to make it clear what we have to do to satisfy
the principles and the law. I am sure it's achievable. However we have to
accept that it's easy for scientists to get it wrong.

I accept this completely and always have. The question is what "attached"
means. I initially thought that the button per se achieved that. Now I
realise we have to do a bit more work. Rufus will post what he and I
considered would do. If we can agree a mechanism that meets your legal
concerns and is manageable by the bulk of scientists - and I am sure we can
- then we are fine.

Never in doubt.

I am assuming Rufus - copied - will post it here.

I don't think we are near this ...

To follow up on Peter's comment here and earlier discussion:

* A button is a nice and simple way to announce to *human* readers
that the material is open. It is *not* however sufficient since it
isn't a license and you need to explicitly attach a license in some
way.

* This can be done in a whole variety of ways including microformats,
embedding RDFa etc. The simplest, IMO, is to put license or a pointer
to the license in some prominent location relative to the data. (NB: I
am sceptical that you will be able actually to embed the license
information directly into the data in many cases -- realistically the
license is going to be "along-side" the data in some sense, either
because it is recorded in a dedicated set of metadata fields -- as in
an institutional repository -- or in a separate README.txt ).

To be concrete, here's the statement you could use for the Public
Domain Dedication and License (PDDL) -- this is direct from the How to
Apply section of <http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/>:

<quote>
This DATA(BASE)-NAME is made available under the Public Domain
Dedication and License (PDDL) v1.0 whose full text can be found at:
<http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/>
</quote>

So to summarize, I think the way to go is:

1. You add a pointer to a license or put the license alongside the
data (e.g. in a LICENSE file)
2.  [Optional but useful] You add an "open data" button
<http://www.opendefisectionnition.org/buttons/>

To see this in action (though with a different data license) see:
<http://www.ckan.net/license/> (and the page footer).

Regards,

Rufus

Yup. It's not like an mp3 or a pdf file, where you can embed. Not to mention
that huge swaths of data will never leave their homes, but will instead be
queried via SPARQL without any copying ever happening!

Like I said, CC0, PDDL, handwritten notes, whatever. The thing is to be
legally clear :-)

> I agree about the problem of the physical separation of the data and
licence. In some cases there is little escape from accompanyinig the data
with a LICENSE.txt. On the positive side there are many compound formats
where it should be relatively easy to embed enough mechanics *in* the
document. I can think of:
* XHTML
* XML; various XMLs (MathML, CML, SVG, etc.)
* DOCX
* PDF (XMP)
* Excel as .XSLX
* PPTX

There is then an implicit assertion that everything in the container is
DATA. For me this works - it's a good way of a scientist asserting that any
text is not a creative work but a necessary part of the data.

If others like this idea then I can see us creating a number of "howtos" for
common formats. I am particulartly keen on embedding this in images (PNGs,
etc.)

The folks at CC have been trying to help but it does not look like we can
make it work on Wikispaces - for now I'll just put in the CC0 license tag
without the metadata

Don't give up so easily. What is the problem you are experiencing?  
Note that you have to have the correct DOCTYPE... below is the correct  
DOCTYPE to use

<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML+RDFa 1.0//EN" "http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/DTD/xhtml-rdfa-1.dtd 
">

Per Nathan's validation example, you might also want to use

<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en">
  <head>
  <title>Title</title>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="application/xhtml 
+xml;charset=utf-8" />

The issue isn't with the doctype (although that *would* be an issue if
we were able to get that far).  It appears WikiSpaces white-lists
certain [X]HTML attributes for HTML you insert into the
sidebar/template, and that list doesn't include the attributes used for
RDFa.

In which case the solution would be easy... add the RDFa attributes to  
the WikiSpaces whitelist. Also, Jean-Claude, don't forget Nathan's  
earlier suggestion -- include CC0 metadata, but hide it with CSS. The  
following should suffice --

<div style="display: none;">
CC0 meta data here
</div>

Of course, now we have another project on our hand -- informing and  
encouraging the various content management software makers (such as  
WikiSpaces) to modify their software to accommodate CC RDFa attributes.

Puneet - I did put that line in - see attached screenshot. If anyone wants
to play around with different ways to make this work feel free to join this
wiki http://onsarchive.wikispaces.com/ - you can put in arbitrary HTML by
doing "insert-widget-other"

"""
Ready for a rapid, radical reboot of the global innovation system for
a truly free and open 21st century knowledge economy? Join us at the
first Open Science Summit, an attempt to gather all stakeholders who
want to liberate our scientific and technological commons and enable
an new era of decentralized, distributed innovation to solve
humanity=92s greatest challenges.

It is trivially true that Science and Technology are the most powerful
drivers of progress and prosperity. However, there is a tremendous and
tragic gap between what is possible, and the shameful scenario that
prevails today.

The well known =9310/90=94 gap references the fact that only 10% of
biomedical spending goes toward conditions that affect 90% of the
world=92s population.  Under this regime, =93diseases of the poor,=94 such
as Malaria, are neglected, while companies focus on =93blockbuster=94
drugs for conditions that affect citizens of the wealthiest nations.
This situation, appalling though it is, actually grossly understates
the systemic flaws of the prevailing biomedical innovation paradigm.
Framing this as a tradeoff of Market vs Social Values or the need for
balancing commercial interests with public health, implies that the
bio-pharma industrial complex works for what it purports to do.  If
only we could find some way to engage or tweak existing mechanisms,
we=92ll make it through.  Wrong!

In fact, despite billions of dollars invested and decades of research,
there has been little to no progress in recent decades even for
extremely =93lucrative=94 conditions like depression or  =94lifestyle=94
applications such as hair loss. Millions of =93wealthy=94 patients in
developed countries suffer from horrific chronic diseases, poorly
understood and difficult to treat auto-immune disorders, and
degenerative conditions such as Parkinson=92s and Alzhiemer=92s.  In the
United Sates, a silver tsunami of aging baby boomers threatens to
overwhelm an already strained healthcare system.  Simultaneously, life
expectancy for the youngest generation is falling for the first time,
as an epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and associated preventable
conditions mocks the notion that we=92ve made progress.  The world lacks
rapid response capability to emerging pandemic viral threats, and
bacteria such as Tuberculosis and MRSA have out-evolved our
antibiotics, leaving humanity vulnerable to an age old foes once
thought conquered.

There is plenty of blame, shame, and pain to go around.  Governments,
Academia, and Industry alike, are all implicated.  Certainly, it is
tremendously difficult to develop and deploy new therapies, but the
hideous expense ($1 billion+ for a new therapeutic) and long timelines
(17 years to market) are unsustainable.  Its not all doom and gloom.
Game changing new technologies, genomic medicine and regenerative stem
cell therapies among them, can cure, not just treat, some of the most
intractable diseases that plague humanity today.  Expending more
resources without deep organizational change will not bring progress.
The broken business models of the 20th century are not adequate to the
challenges we face.  We can and must do better.

Just as disturbing as the innovation shortfall of recent decades, is
the barometer of public opinion. Appallingly large numbers of people
ascribe to the =93anti-vaccine movement.=94 Vaccination is the single
greatest tool ever devised for public health, responsible for triumphs
such as the eradication of Polio and Smallpox.  To arrogantly dismiss
public fears as hysterical or uneducated, even if there is some truth
to this, fails to acknowledge the greater truth that we have not
provided the transparency, education, and honesty (in the form of
disclosing potential conflicts of interest where they arise), the
public requires if it is to trust the global scientific and medical
establishment.  When scandals such as =93Climategate=94 occur, the
integrity of Science itself is undermined at precisely the moment we
need it most.

With the falling costs of basic enabling technologies, we could choose
to embrace a new golden era of citizen science, an era in which
amateur investigators have ever more powerful tools with which to
investigate themselves (via personal genomics), and their
environments.  Such a participatory paradigm shift can make all the
difference.  Only a renegotiation and reaffirmation of the social
contract for science can open the path to a successful future for us
all.  The Summit attempts to chart that course.

Students interested in attending the conference can contact us
regarding discounted student rates.
