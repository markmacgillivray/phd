a case of corporate powers blocking open scholarly, by simple tweeks of
interface. I wonder if there's something to be done.
e.g. can we campaign for an academic boycott of bibliographic indices that
do not provide a BibTex interface?

By the way, I personally much prefer Bibsonomy to Zotero, but that's beside
the point.

-----Original Message-----

There was discussion on this list last year on the law suit that
Thomson-Reuters were taking against George Mason Uni to try to shut down
Zotero, the F/OSS alternative to EndNote. See
http://dltj.org/article/endnote-zotero-lawsuit/ or
http://www.zotero.org/blog/offical-statement/

Yesterday I was updating my teaching presentation on the use of on-line
bibliographic resources. In the course of doing so I discovered that T-R
have re-jigged the ISI site so you it no longer presents its result in a
form readable by Zotero.

This seems to me morally, if not in law, an abuse of T-R's growing
monopolistic power over key resources essential to the academic
community and something we should regard with the deepest suspicion.

I hope that list members will make this abuse widely known.

Subject: [open-science] Call for articles: deadline extended. User-led,
	P2P Science
Message-ID: <20090514171523.721g3j17kk8c808s@webmail.sissa.it>

Call for articles:
User-led, P2P Science - A special issue of JCOM, Journal of Science  
Communication

Deadline: June 1st, 2009
http://jcom.sissa.it/call

Science is increasingly being produced, discussed and deliberated with  
cooperative tools by web users and without the istitutionalized  
presence of scientists. "Popular science" or "Citizen science" are two  
of the traditional ways of defining science grassroots produced  
outside the walls of laboratories. But the internet has changed the  
way of collecting and organising the knowledge produced by people -  
peers - who do not belong to the established scientific community. In  
this issue we want to discuss:

- How web tools are changing and widening this way of participating in  
the production of scientific knowledge. Do this increase in  
participation consist in a real shift towards democratizing science or  
on the contrary is merely a rhetoric which do not affect the  
asymmetrical relationships between citizens and institutions?

- The ways in which both academic and private scientific institutions  
are appropriating this knowledge and its value. Do we need a new model  
to understand these ways of production and appropriation? Are they  
part of a deeper change in productive paradigms?

We would like to collect both theoretical contributions and research  
articles which address for example case studies in social media and  
science, peer production, the role of private firms in exploiting web  
arenas to collect scientific/medical data from their costumers, online  
social movements challenging communication incumbents, web tools for  
development.

Interested authors should submit an extended abstract of no more than  
500 words (in English) to the issue editor by June 1st, 2009. We will  
select three to five papers for inclusion in this special issue.  
Abstracts should be sent to the JCOM's editorial office  
(jcom-eo at jcom.sissa.it) by email.

Please help us and spread this call in your mailing lists, blogs, websites.

Just in case anyone hasn't seen it, EMBL has used CC0 for some of
their data. Great news!

I've entered the material in CKAN at:

EMBL puts data in the public domain via CC0

May 7th, 2009 by Kaitlin Thaney

EMBL - the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, has made part of
their SIDER Side Effect Resource available to the public free of
restriction via CC0, placing it in the public domain.

The database, SIDER, contains information on marketed medicines and
their recorded adverse side effects and drug reactions. Included in
this dataset is information on the frequency of these drug reactions,
other drug and side effect classifications as well as links to other
relevant resources. To date, 888 drugs are listed in the database, a
tremendous resource for research and drug discovery.

The mapping of labels and euphoria-related side effects are now public
domain, with some other side effect information available for download
under a CC-BY-NC-SA license.

Have you made your information available using CC0? We?re love to hear
about it. Drop us a note.

For more information about our data policy and reasoning, see our
Database Protocol or ?Freedom to Research? available for download over
at our Reading Room.
