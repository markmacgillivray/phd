Subject: [open-science] Hargreaves Report - urgent call for help with draft
	response
Message-ID: <CABPM+wove01gRLWC-wMTqTp8pf8-R2BrEUsVW4M2avhuhs6EmA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

A while ago, the working group started a response to the Hargreaves Report
http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ipreview
This report could lead to substantial changes to UK copyright law,
particularly with regard to text mining of the scientific literature and we
feel that a response is both necessary and urgent.

You can contribute to the draft response here http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-
hargreaves and we would be grateful for any and all input, particularly any
data and hard figures as well as personal experience surrounding access to
the literature for text mining or the possible contribution that text
mining could make to scientific discovery and the economy.

If you wish to discuss points in detail, you can use either this email
thread copying both open-science and open-access, make notes within the
text on the Etherpad or in the chat window on the right of the pad.

Thank you very much in advance for your help!

Jenny

Hi Jenny,
 
It's not clear from email, or from the links you cite what the deadline is,
or by when (presumably earlier) you need comments.
 
Thanks

Thanks Diane!

So we need to have something together by 21 March, but essentially as soon
as possible. Peter Murray-Rust is currently collating publisher policies to
text mining for the response so may have a better idea what time scale
would be reasonable to try and collect all our material.

My timescale is roughly (I would appreciate help on some areas)
* draft a set of principles and protocol before the weekend. (Elsevier have
asked me for a telcom to discuss my textmining requirements. I replied that
my requirements were the same as everyone else's and that I would make the
results of the conversation Open. I offered them 2200 today but I suspect
that's too early. So I'll have a base by Sunday.
* Mail all the reps of publishers by Sunday evening announcing what we are
doing and inviting comments. Invite them to join the list. NOTE: This is
NOT a negotiation. This is a clarification or our rights and a request to
the publishers to agree them or to publicly disagree. I am NOT giving up
any territory.
* announce that we want their comments by <date>. My guess is that
2012-03-14 is a good date. If they are well-intentioned they can easily
answer YES. If they huff and pff then they aren't trying. After all they
set the conditions and they can remove them

* in parallel draft our submission
* collate the responses into the submission.

NOTE: The submissions will be further edited by Ben Hawes at IPO. He is
required to be objective. The intention is that the responses will be read
by the public and also by legislators. The legislators can change many
things without legislation. Legislation is heavier and will take a long
time but may be necessary.

NOTE: It is Europe who imposes NC on textmining. Nonetheless it is worth
making the cases for CC-BY

NOTE: I am meeting Neelie Kroes (Digital Economy, Europe) next month, I hope

Thanks Anthony for flagging this up it was an excellent programme! It's
still available for a few days if people want to listen.
If you're short on time I've blogged some highlights on the Open Science

I have copied this to the open-science list. It is not a trivial task. We
are just at the start. The funders are starting to require data to be open,
to put in place an infrastructure for data citation, etc.

It will be highly valuable if someone or some organization wants to do it.
But it's a moving target and will need revising at least annually

Yes that would be great if we start working on Open Hand Book of Research
Data. I would like to be part of the team. Science commons is working on
open access to scientific data.

Thanks & Regards

Peter ande Sridhar

I have recently completed some research related to open access, still
wrestling with some of it a bit, but hope to be sharing findings publicly
soon.
Yes, interested to contribute to Handbook, what are the options? scientific
commons? independent? :-) P

Dear All,

I agree with Peter that writing the Open Research Data Handbook is not an easy task. Not only is this a complex issue but also a moving target, that would require regular update.

I also agree with Carolina and Sridhar that writing this handbook might be useful, and should include experts from different research areas.

However I think before we continue we should discuss the scope, target group of the handbook. We should also look what is already out there to avoid re-inventing the wheel and make sure we strengthen existing initiatives.

I am willing to help coordinate this effort if we did it, but I am not en expert in open science / open research so I guess the handbook would need someone else to take a lead.

What do people think?

Daniel

Science is very varied. We can easily imagine:

   - high-energy physics (etabytes)
   - astronomy - highly multidisciplinary with many images
   - bio-informatics very multidisciplinary with very many distributed
   sources
   - long-tail science - where individual labs capture much data without
   coordination
   - environment and geoscience - where authorities collect data
   systematically
   - climate data


I know enough to tackle 3 slightly and 4 and people to contact in the
others (but not necessarily OKF). We need at least 10 people to get a
reasonable overview. Alternatively we might split into subdisciplines like
this.

I have been invited to speak in Rome (where Neelie Kroes is also speaking)
so it's valuable to get something underway!!

I think this is a very exciting idea. If we can gather enough momentum and
enthusiasm at the start, we could produce something of real value at a
moment in which it is really needed. I'm definitely +1 !

I would also be happy to help coordinate. Like Daniel though, I'm not a
scientist. I think we would need someone with scientific knowledge (perhaps
from either the open-science or open-access groups?) to take a lead. Does
anyone feel that they would like to do this?

In the meantime, perhaps we can make a list of people who might be
interested in contributing, and their area of expertise. I have begun a
list below, please add names & details.

* Daniel Dietrich (general coord; OKFN Germany)
* Laura Newman (general coord; OKFN UK)
* Sridhar Gutam
* Carolina Odman
* Paola di Maio
* Peter Murray-Rust (?)

I also copy Peter's list of types science data for reference, and to check
we have most bases covered. Please do feel free to amend/extend:

   - high-energy physics (etabytes)
   - astronomy - highly multidisciplinary with many images
   - bio-informatics very multidisciplinary with very many distributed
   sources
   - long-tail science - where individual labs capture much data without
   coordination
   - environment and geoscience - where authorities collect data
   systematically
   - climate data

Lets see what kind of response we get. If there's enough enthusiasm, we can
explore how best to go about putting something together.

All the best,
Laura

OK, I seem to be the only one here :/

So, it's Wednesday *7* March, I guess?

Dear All,

I am doing advocacy on Open Access in my organization (Indian Council of
Agricultural Research, India) and I also see lots of data being collected
by various scientists involved in research projects. Only a part of the
data goes into publication and rest is left un-touched for any of the
analysis!!

Now the challenge is how to get that data locked up in Data Books/Computers
to see the light and would be used for meaningful analysis!!!

I see a big hurdle in this... none of the researcher wants to share the
data (raw data) and what is published is in pdf/print formats. Collating is
very big problem.

In this month at Bangalore, India on March 24th there is going to be a one
day unconference on Open Data <http://odc.datameet.org/>. I am going to
place the same before the group how to get the Research Data out into
Open/LinkedOpenData.

I can share the view of the Scientists in Agriculture Research as myself
being a Scientist working in Agriculture Research Service in India
(ICAR-ARS).

Please comment.

Thanks & Regards
Sridhar

If we can move that deadline a bit earlier... because right now, I'm
staying late at work, just for this meeting... I actually left early
yesterday, to take the call from home :(

We have 3 more on the call so we'll go ahead at 17:30. Please anyone else
join in on the Etherpad if you are around.
(Sorry about the date confusion there Egon, I have another event tonight
which was originally on 6th so i think that threw me)

Subject: [open-science] text-mining restrictions redux
Message-ID: <D1C3095F-3863-4AF5-820F-6E16693ED6FC@ad.unc.edu>

Hello all,

When text mining was a hot topic on this list last year, Jenny Molloy started an open Google Doc to keep us track of what publishers did and did not allow their subscribers to do: http://bit.ly/zyyR98

The spreadsheet lists, for each publisher: 
- a link to their standard license agreement, where possible
- whether that agreement explicitly prohibits text/data mining or not (or the language is ambiguous, as in the case of Wiley)
- the relevant quote upon which that interpretation is based

In response to the recent discussions around Elsevier's text-mining policy, it has become apparent that for those publishers with standard license agreements that disallow text-mining, there may also be language added *allowing* text-mining for those customers who have specifically negotiate (or demand?) it.  

So a column has now been added to include the existence or ideally the language of such additional agreements, where known.  Unfortunately, Elsevier has expressly asked that this language not be shared.  We currently lack information on whether equivalent "over-rides" are available for subscribers to other publishers.

Regardless of how one feels about the legal and moral standing of publishers to control the use of their content in this way, it would be valuable to keep this resource current as documentation of the obstacles that are put in the way of effective use of the literature.

So this is an open invitation to review the document and please fix any errors or add any information that you may have.  It will be instructive to compare the responses from PMR's enquiry with this information that was available a year or so ago.

NPG language that appears to disallow text-mining is particularly interesting in light of the editorial that appeared in the latest issue of Nature: "Publishers and scientists should do more to foster the mining of research literature by computer" [1] 

For last year's thread, which had some interesting and still relevant points, see the subject "text-mining restrictions - a plea for more information" from April 2011.

cheers,
Todd

In relation to text mining:


What do people use for converting PDF to text? My default was/is 
'pdftotext' but it has some issues, e.g., ligatures, greek characters, 
whitespaces. I have looked at pyPdf which might be promising as it is 
easier (for me) to modify the extractText method. A-PDF GUI program 
didn't work on my Ubuntu Wine. Adobe Acrobat had the same issues as 
pdftotext and also there is a two-column issue and it is not a CLI 
program. I have some notes here: http://neuro.imm.dtu.dk/wiki/PDF


Following Todd Vision's "text-mining restrictions redux" email:

What about abstracts from full text papers? Does anyone know how 
publishers feel about their abstracts? Can we republish them? Is that 
fair use? Are they CC-BY-NC or perhaps even CC-BY? I cannot find any 
explicit remark about that from the publishers.

awesome, i didn't know about PDFbox.

imagine how great it would be to combine good content extraction with the
annotator tool

Perhaps sooner rather than later we will not be limited to abstracts.
There is work being done to extend what it is that publishers will
make available.  A paper to which I contributed is found at

What is the nature of the authority that the Minister has in this regard?  Is he claiming power under some munitions regulation or from something else?  Is there some specific research that led to this reaction?

It originates from the research at Rotterdam where the mutated a flu
virus, showing how little is needed for a flu to mutate to become
dangerous. The international scientific community is dealing with this
properly already, but that is apparently not enough for underminister
Bleker.

But the problem is that means the Dutch underminister picks up...
"publishing is export an requires a permit".

*That* applies to all science. And that threat is really badly picked
by the underminister...

Unbelievable.

This is similar to the US restriction on software. You may not sell
computational cheistry software to the axis-of-evil (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil Iran, North Korea, Cuba etc. -
the list changes). The American Chemical Society does not accept papers
from authors in these countries (I think this is a legal restriction and
may be true of all US publishers).

And the Netherlands has also produced Neelie Kroes who is fighting for
knowledge liberation in Europe.

If Bleker meets Kroes then we we might have a knowledge - anti-knowledge
explosion

awesome, i didn't know about PDFbox.

imagine how great it would be to combine good content extraction with the annotator tool

Perhaps sooner rather than later we will not be limited to abstracts.
There is work being done to extend what it is that publishers will make available.  A paper to which I contributed is found at

What is the nature of the authority that the Minister has in this regard?  Is he claiming power under some munitions regulation or from something else?  Is there some specific research that led to this reaction?

It originates from the research at Rotterdam where the mutated a flu
virus, showing how little is needed for a flu to mutate to become
dangerous. The international scientific community is dealing with this
properly already, but that is apparently not enough for underminister
Bleker.

But the problem is that means the Dutch underminister picks up...
"publishing is export an requires a permit".

*That* applies to all science. And that threat is really badly picked
by the underminister...

Unbelievable.

This is similar to the US restriction on software. You may not sell
computational cheistry software to the axis-of-evil (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil Iran, North Korea, Cuba etc. -
the list changes). The American Chemical Society does not accept papers
from authors in these countries (I think this is a legal restriction and
may be true of all US publishers).

And the Netherlands has also produced Neelie Kroes who is fighting for
knowledge liberation in Europe.

If Bleker meets Kroes then we we might have a knowledge - anti-knowledge
explosion

It's an EU regulation. EU Dual-Use Regulation (also known as Council Regulation (EC) No 428/2009).  The UK has implementing legislation and it's own Axis of Evil list. It extends to documents and plans, as well as equipment.

The reaction of the under-minister is also comparable to the reaction that
open access to scientific literature is dangerous because terrorists can
use it (one of the arguments in the debate around SOPA)
The u minister thinks he can do this because he is u minister of the Deprt
of Economics in the Netherlands but we have to see if he can pull this off.
Meanwhile I think we should strongly protest this move

Do suggest something like this to be looked at during the Open Science
hackday!
http://science.okfn.org/2012/03/07/open-science-hackday-31-mar-2012-london/

Clearly not something to be solved quickly but it may get a good group of
people discussing it and lead to a PDF focused group. These kind of tools
are useful across the range of OKF activities so I've copied in the
okfn-discuss list.

We have a table transcription tool from a previous hackday which it was
hoped could be turned into an automated tool

Dear All

Do spread the word about a meeting on open science in Oxford next week -
details below!

---------------------------------------------------

Oxford Open Science - a group for anyone in Oxford interested in projects
related to open science. Maybe you're looking at ways to share scientific
data more effectively, planning a project involving citizen crowd sourcing,
want to make your research as accessible as possible or maybe you're just
interested in how openness and transparency could change the way we do
science.

Come and join us for our first meetup at the Oxford Hub for lightning
talks, discussion and planning. The group will focus on creating useful
tools, apps and guidelines for open science and also building a community
in Oxford, with both discussion based meetups and hack sessions planned for
the future.

When: Wednesday 15th March 2012, 7pm-8:30pm ***Note change of time from 6pm

Subject: [open-science] open science hack day (was Re: Text mining,
 PDF to text conversion, and permissions on abstracts)
Message-ID: <CA+bBsEm7ZJDTd1tNDBm3ALUG+barUu2Dc10Q+bjTEpRQRipupg@mail.gmail.com>

hey jenny/all,

i'm based in SF, and have been on the lists for a while but usually more of
a lurker.

i just added a few ideas i've been thinking about to the open science hack
day pad, hope that's cool (and happy to explain any of them more if they
are not clear).
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-mar12

it turns out that on the same day in palo alto we're having super happy
block party <http://www.superhappy.be/>, a block party/hackathon for the
50th super happy dev house <http://shdh.org>.

i was thinking it would be cool to advertise the open science hack day to
this crowd and coordinate with others who might want to participate here at
devhouse. the event is 1pm - 1am pacific time, so i guess we'll be rather
behind you all but might overlap for a few hours with some of the latebirds
in IRC...

All,

Oxford University have just uploaded a video of the recent public debate about open science.

http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/evolution-science-open-publishing-video

        Open Science    
          In
 this series of podcasts we consider the impact of opening up science: 
allowing both the research community and the public to freely access the
 results of scientific work. Individuals can be fully informed about 
medical or environmental research, students worldwide can get access to 
the latest work, and software agents can roam the vast scientific 
knowledge base seeking patterns and correlations that no human has 
observed. Ultimately, it may profoundly change the way science is done.
A distinguished group comes together in Oxford's Rhodes House to 
publicly debate 'The Scientific Evolution: Open Science and the Future 
of Publishing'. 

Panelists include Fields Medal winning mathematician 
Tim Gowers, molecular biologist and TV personality Lord Robert Winston, 
and representatives from publishers Nature and Elsevier. Together they 
ask "Is there a better way for scientists to communicate their work?". 
The event was chaired by quantum physicist Dr Simon Benjamin, and 
sponsored by Oxford's Materials Department.

I just saw the video at
http://podcasts.ox.ac.uk/evolution-science-open-publishing-video
and was very disappointed to see it had been put under a -NC license.
Where did that idea come from? Can we correct this, or at least
prevent it from happening with future shindings?

I can email the organisers and ask if they could explain and possibly alter
the license.
This event was independent to OKFN so ultimately it is up to them but I'll
see what I can do.

A pure guess, but in the present case I suspect either the organizers don't
know the problem or that it's a University facility that uses this because
it looks good  and "stops people taking advantage" (or similar).

FWIW some University IRs use CC-NC. And some refuse to change.

Benjamin Simon replied to my inquiry and said that CC BY-NC-SA is
Oxford University policy.
Anyone in for talking to them?

My guess is that most academic rights policies were made by people who
didn't understand and/or think about the issues at the time and find it
more trouble than it's worth to them to change them. It's very tedious to
have to keep fighting this lot but we have to. There is also a tradition in
academia of re-invention and reinventing the same wrong solution.

They will be submitting a response to Hargreaves on this point but there may be some data in the report that we can cite in our submission.

It was a very lively one.  David Baker (JISC) talked about how big data is simply too complex for individuals to process by hand.  Diane McDonald (consultant) reviewed the methodology and findings. Mark Walport talked about the advantages to researchers.  Martin Hall (Salford) spoke on how it helps HEIs.  Doug Kell (BBSRC) reiterated how hard it is to determine what permissions are available and how time-consuming it is to secure them across nearly 1000 publications and (I think it was Kell) cited a study showing that 66% of a researcher's time would be required just to process that many permissions.

The only person who admitted being anti-open mining was Richard Mollet of the Publisher's Association.  Privately he claimed that Elsevier said that it had only had a handful of requests to data mine and all had been allowed so Mollet asks why a blanket exception is needed with so few needy.  When pinned, it turned out he was only referring to requests that came through university subscriptions (i.e., not individual inquiries).  Publicly, he whined about how the study had not looked at the economic impact on publishers.  Some fellow from (?Nesta) immediately presented a series of cogent arguments about how open data benefitted publishers directly and then Walport summed it up by saying that open data is the future and publishers should just get with it or die. 

Kell mentioned (his?) article Nature 483 (March) "Trouble in the Text Mine".

Please don't. They are not direct quotes but rather my paraphrasing and not for publication.

That version wouldn't be as much fun.  I can't recall his precise words, but he warned that researchers who are providing free peer-review services to publishers now might very well end up offering those services directly to their own institutions (under a Gold system) instead of to commercial publishers, therefore publishers would do well to start looking for different business models.

approach publishers with requests for text-mining. I am publishing their

Yes. I am very conscious that we pay the publishers (through subscriptions)
who then employ staff to prevent us doing things. The publishers make an
apparently persuasive case - "always being helpfule". In fact they aren't
and part of our task is to pull together evidence to show that they have
prevaricated, flannelled, and in some areas are incompetent (not knowing
the difference between copyright and contract - BTW it is the contracts
that current stop me working - the libraries have signed many of our
current rights to the publishers.

This is my weekend's fun - fighting the publishers rather than doing
science.

Subject: [open-science] the early-career guide to doing open science?
Message-ID: <874ntoh9lq.fsf@pobox.com>


summary: are there guides to, e.g., archiving and enabling access to
science inputs and outputs? esp for the under-resourced, early-career
scientist-in-training.

details:

I'm a former software engineer, now a graduate student in atmospheric
modeler. My products as a computational scientist will continue to be
"soft" (whether, e.g., code, documents, graphics), and will therefore
have needs similar to those of open-source software (OSS) projects:
e.g., version control, backup, public access. (Hence I still consider
myself very much a software engineer, though my colleagues seem to see
themselves as scientists who just happen to work with software--but
that's a separate matter.) As a coder I have worked, and continue to
work, on several OSS projects, and am fairly familiar with the various
distributed version-control systems (DVCS, e.g., git) and cloud-based
platforms for OSS development.

I'd like to learn more about best practices (and, frankly, cheap
practices :-) for similarly maintaining and (for want of a better
term) "opening" one's scientific products, whether finished or under
development). Ideally I'd like to also

* keep one copy of important data on my cluster, and another in a
  cloud repository

* version important data as it's received and processed

* version analytics (e.g., plots that take more than a minute, or that
  require significant setup, to produce) as they are updated

similar to the manner in which one uses syncable local and cloud DVCS
for the code that processes and analyzes that data. I could then

* point colleagues at the cloud repository for collaboration

* reference a branch of my project as supplemental information for
  publications

* do "automated build" of publications out of the repository, in the
  manner that installable software is built from sources

* incorporate branched data from others' repositories as needed

I am currently hosting a small part of my current project on free OSS
sites. But, unlike most straight-code projects, data (whether raw or
processed) must also be managed, in volume. Unfortunately, the free
sites of which I'm aware usually

- provide what are, for me at least, small filespaces (scale ~= 1 GB).

- disallow versioning of large files and binaries (e.g., netCDF data) 

Given my status, and the state of science funding in the US, free
repositories are all I can afford for the foreseeable future. I would
hope that one or more of the institutions with which I am affiliated
would provide functionality suited to open-science workflows such as
the above, but that does not seem forthcoming. (They seem much more
interested in keeping all but officially-approved content "inside the
firewall," which is partly understandable, but greatly restricts
collaboration and openness.)

I find the open ethos compelling in both domains--science and
software--both normatively (esp for more policy-relevant science) and
positively/pragmatically ("more eyes make shallow bugs"). Hence I'm
hoping that there is already support for the type of workflows sketched
above (and to solutions for other problems for open scientists of which
I am as yet blissfully unaware :-), and that folks out there can pass
pointers to sites, groups, or docs describing their use.

TIA, Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

Have you approached your university's institutional repository? While
many are not as feature rich as we've become accustomed to with
enterprise solutions, many do provide the option of versioning and, in
some cases, will provide large-scale file storage for free (no matter
the file type). They can be a great place to find preservation-quality
data storage, and the librarians who run them are generally more than
happy to work with folks who wish to make their data open.

What field of research are you in? Are you strictly computer science,
or does your research overlap with a subject area that has its own
subject repositor(y/ies) (such as astrophysics)?

Greetings Tom,

I understand and empathize with your problem. Although I am in an
institution this isn't a huge amount of help. My own "solution" so far has
been to run my own server (financed by grant money, for sure). But the main
problem is that maintaining this oneself is costly in time and expertise. I
am very lucky in the people I have had in my group. They have implemented,
for example, a Jenkins (Hudson) Continuous integration system (
http://hudson.ch.cam.ac.uk) But, since I have closed down my group its will
inevitably decay.

Universities aren't the best places for this as they are increasingly
predicated on competition. For example in most of my infrastructure I can
get this from the OKF - wikis, etherpads, etc. And there is a group of
volunteers who will help with the technology.

Data is a real, objective problem. I just heard that Tranche (U Mich) is
finding difficulty staying alive. Bioinformatics has huge amounts of public
money and uses it very well. Outside that there is Dryad (but coupled to
publications) and Figshare.

I am not a supporter of Institutional repositories for data. They are
library-oriented and extremely scattered. I favour national libraries (e.g.
the British Library in the UK).

This triggers me to ask whether the OKF might not seek public funding for a
data repository for science, maybe in conjunction with a national library?

I disagree (somewhat). IRs may not have been equipped to handle data
in the past, but that is changing. Libraries are (slowly) moving away
from the "I know what's best for you" approach and starting to build
services that researchers need (not just those that serve the library
and administration). Good IRs (such as IU, if I may say so) have
started partnering with uni Research Offices and IT to provide large
scale storage services for researchers. For researchers who are simply
looking for free storage with versioning capabilities, I think it's at
least worth exploring if your IR provides what you're looking for.

That being said, subject repositories might be the way to go, as many
build services specific to what is needed/standards for your field.

I'm not sure what national libraries in the US might have to offer. If
anyone has guidance to that point, I'd be interested to hear it.

Respectfully, Peter: does the OKFN need to build a new repository or
would time/effort/money be better spent partnering with various
libraries and IRs to improve existing repositories, to better serve
the needs of scientists? There's a large gap, as you pointed out,
between what purpose library IRs serve and those built by scientists.
What if the OKFN were to create "common sense guidelines" (and then
instructions for implementation, written in partnership with libraries
using various IR platforms) for what scientists need/want out of IRs
(in terms of data), so that IR managers could go about making changes
to existing repositories, to fit that need? There have been a few
posts/papers/presentations made, but no solid, widely-used guidelines
(written by scientists, for librarians) for implementation. Better to
use less resources and improve the existing tools than create (yet
another) repository, IMHO.

If you and the rest of the group agreed with this strategy, I'd love
to move from "lurker" status to a participating WG member to help make
such guidelines happen.

You mean arXiv? I'm not aware of anything like that in "environmental
science" or modeling. I would dearly like to know of one: please pass
pointers to any candidates of which you are aware! 

BTW: arXiv only does preprints, not data, no? (I am vastly ignorant

I'll definitely start looking for local e-science workers. A quick
google is finding only presentations and statements of intent, but
there is a Library Science program, which I'll ping.

I'd say, "the" problem in this domain, since the other functionality
you describe (e.g., CI, wikis) can be gotten from the free providers
(examples above) ... *except* "the big disk" for archiving "big data."

Given my admitted ignorance, there may be problems with the following
proposal, nonetheless: I'd suggest partnering with one or more of the
free DVCS/devsites above. AFAICS they provide most of the required
services (what am I missing? probably a lot :-) except "big data"
archiving. (And they provably scale.) So why not provide the latter
service(s) and tie them to an existing frontend and set of services?

Your assistance is appreciated! Tom Roche <Tom_Roche at pobox.com>

Hi Tom,

It sounds like you know you're way around tools and webservers, and
capacity/cost is your primary challenge?  Not sure where you're based, but
I would contact <http://www.nersc.gov/about/contact-us/> a computing
resources center like the US Dept of Energy's NERSC center.  They can have
great support for sharing
data<http://www.nersc.gov/users/data-and-networking/sharing-data/>and
the best
capacity/backup security/support
<http://www.nersc.gov/users/data-and-networking/hpss/about/>you'll find.
They have grants that award computing time and access, so I would write to
them to discuss your needs.  As a graduate student and with your goals, I
suspect you'd have no trouble getting a system.  I've found their support
to be responsive and helpful.

I'd also recommend looking at the Merritt
Archive<http://www.cdlib.org/services/uc3/merritt/>provided by UC
digital libraries.

My own system is based largely around github for sharing/collaborating on
code, figures, etc.  I don't tend to put raw data files under version
control systems, and rather try to follow the recommendations of Software
Carpentry for data <http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/data/mgmt/> (briefly:
version manage the readmes). I could imagine you might want to keep a copy
of all your code on github, and just link the data files to a
larger-capacity server (such as I mention above) from the README.md files,
which are also version managed on github and nicely displayed. This gives
easy access to the data.

If you go the github route, I'd write to github support and discuss what
you envision -- they are very invested in promoting this kind of thing and
have made allowances in the past for more space, managing binaries, etc.

Figshare.org also has excellent support for archiving data and figures, you
could link to them from the version-managed github readmes.

While we could always improve on the technical end, I believe there's
reasonably good infrastructure to support what you propose to do at minimal
cost -- the primary challenges are finding people with a will to do it, and
to a lesser extent the knowhow.

Thanks for your question.  It sounds like you already bring a lot of
expertise from your previous experiences, so I'd be curious to hear what
solution you settle on.

-Carl

I don't understand what figshare.org's value offer is... just hosting?
but only for my graphs/charts? Why would I use this instead of my own
hosting?

Puneet, That's a great point re: general IRs. Too often, the things
that scientists need out of a repository are too specific to their
field for most IRs at universities to find sense in implementing them.

What if an existing IR were to receive a grant (to get that
all-important funding) and work with scientists to build special tools
that would serve needs specific to your field but would fit onto an
existing platform (ePrints or DSpace, the two main open source
platforms in use)? The outcome would be a module that would work with
any repository running those platforms. To play devil's advocate,
though: should we be making plugins for decentralized repositories
when most scientists seem to find use in subject repositories?

What if such a uni IR had a particularly robust _subject
sub-community_ that anyone could upload to, and that included tools
that were useful to researchers in that subject area (imagine the
possibilities if our platform had the search, browse, data viz, etc
capabilities that Geologists needed --
https://scholarworks.iu.edu/dspace/handle/2022/448)?

Just thinking aloud, mostly. Sorry to have taken this discussion
slightly off-topic, but I find it more useful to talk out these issues
with (open) scientists rather than librarians. I'm also keen to raise
awareness of the possibilities if scientists partner with libraries
towards a common goal.

Hi Bryan,

A related question would be: why do many people use github when they could
just host there own git?

probably lots of reasons:

DOI links for data
Social discovery / centralized discovery
shared public repository -- I can explore all content without having to
discover each researcher's site.
How about scientists without there own hosting, or the knowledge or money
to set it up?
easy to use interface
unlimited capacity for public data?
idea sounds good / supports the open data concept more visibly then hosting
themselves?

The fact that it is 'only' for data and code isn't a big barrier in the
case that it's open, since I can link/embed those figures or data next to
my code or in my lab notebook, etc, so 'location' doesn't matter so much?

-Carl

This is a really valuable discussion. Some quick points:

   - Not everyone is in a University. Those outside are immediately part of
   the #scholarlypoor. The solution "talk to your institutional repo" is no
   use for people in an institution
   - Some IRs are suitable for data. Australia has got its act together
   (TARDIS, etc.) But in (say) UK there are probably 100-300 institutions and
   what they offer is very variable.
   - I suggested OKF because (a) they have several years of running the
   CKAN repo (b) they have good relations with funders in Europe, especially
   things like Europeana. (c) they have good relations with gov.* I wasn't
   suggesting a huge data fortress in Panton Street - that's why I suggested BL
   - Dryad deals with some aspects of evolution
   - Sourceforge and its descendants have made software available to the
   masses. We need the same attitude and provision for data. Not all software
   is created in universities and nor is all data.

I am not suggesting etabytes but I can certainly see the value of public
storage for data in - say - amateur (in the bestb sense of the world)
astronomy, ornithology, land use, meterology, oceanography - whatever.
Whether it's from the national purse or commerce - who knows.

And if the country is crying out for data mungers (as OKF suggests) then
this is a really cost-effective investment in on-th-job-training. After all
we are running a virtual course on data , aren't we?

True.  Maybe using arxiv instead of putting on your personal website would
be a better comparison -- there's value in a central archive.

True again, but there's no reason for the data to be in just one place, if
you're trying to share.  I wouldn't rely on github alone for the future of
my code, but it's easy to maintain copies there, on my servers, my laptop,
and still use figshare to facilitate getting the data to others.  This goes
back to Peter's comments -- no doubt we need a variety of solutions for
these different challenges.

hey guys,

this doesn't solve the repository problem, but is in response to the
original subject line: "early career guide to doing open science."

as some of you know the peer to peer university <http://p2pu.org/> is
currently experimenting with peer-based learning using teams (study groups,
courses), challenges, and badges. there's been a lot of discussion around
open research and open science at, as something that a) p2pu is trying to
encourage for research done about p2pu initiatives, b) we would like to
encourage more open research BY p2pu community and others (not necessarily
about learning) and c) involves but also has some different elements from
peer-based learning alone.

we've started working on a core set of "open science
challenges<http://pad.p2pu.org/p/opensciencecontent>"
that we would incorporate into the challenges infrastructure at p2pu (or
anywhere really, it's just what's available :)). my hope is that they could
capture some of the core processes and activities of basic research,
provide links to useful tools and initiatives, and incorporate open
practice in a way that "just makes sense." it would aim to provide a clear
place to get started practicing open science, based on the experience of
others, without having to re-derive that process every time. and finally,
with enough help, we can have some mentorship in that process too.

this would be great, as tom said, for newish grad students and researchers
- but IMHO also for opening up the actual core elements of the scientific
process, with the idea that anyone can participate - even the so-called
#sholarlypoor.

i would love it if people had ideas and suggestions to improve, rip apart,
clean up, extend, etc. these challenges. i was actually planning to email
this list as i know that people like carl, peter, cameron etc. are all both
practitioners and thought leaders in this area.

for example, a great one to add from this discussion would be one on
repositories and open data. there are currently two relevant challenges
already started: "develop a documentation plan" and "make your results,
data available to others" that could really be fleshed out.

i am happy to volunteer to take any raw notes people put in there and
incorporate them into prose for challenges. and we are also very interested
in general feedback, ideas and participation

thanks!
jessy

Peter, you're absolutely right re: universities and their resources. I
was definitely looking at this is a uni context, when it's much
broader than that.

Many unis, though, are becoming increasingly interested in creating
tools and programs for the larger community/ies. Perhaps a strategy
similar to one that Puneet suggests--larger IRs backing smaller, more
agile teams that create a data repo serving a niche community--could
be the way to move forward (and with the OKF providing strategies for
doing so).

I'd advocate strongly for partnering with "public trusts" such as
gov't bodies, national libraries, or universities to provide the
infrastructure for any kind of amateur data storage utility, though,
as leaving it in the hands of commerce to provide solutions could lead
to "closed" data. Look what happened with the scholarly journal
system. :)

This is part of the crux. Public libraries look to their community.
National libraries look to their community. University libraries ought to
and generally don't. You mentioned IU - I know IU very well - we have even
had joint grant applications with David Wild, Geoff Fox, etc.

So shouldn't IU have a responsibility to look after the needs of the state
of Indiana? (the same could be said of Cambridge, I suppose, as it's in the
Albertian tradition). But universities look inwards when they should be
reaching out in a digital age. Why should I get to read the STM literature
and not most of the people at the OKF Data group in the Panton two weeks
ago. Some really powerful intellects and experience could be liberated.

So a C21 model would be for Nation (libraries, funders) to combine with
Open expertise (maybe univs, but much outside) to make these resources
available for all. The robber baron Carnegie built the public library
system in the US - we have enough robber barons now who might have
consciences? But, unfortunately, companies don't have consciences.

On other points - yes, we let commercial orgs like Figshare, Google,
Mendeley manage our resources at our peril. But that's the Faustian
bargain. Universities SHOULD have a role here but they are gazing at their
hIndex navels instead of building the C21. The orgs I trust are public ones
with momentum, funding however small, and democratic DNA. They will be the
successes of our time.

Assuming we aren't all subsumed into a SOPA-like Ministry of Truth.

Hi All, apologies if you get this twice, it bounced back from the diybio list originally,


Bryan, I'm Mark I set up http://figshare.com. Figshare allows you to make all of your research outputs available in a citable manner with persistent identifiers and usage metrics as well as 1GB of private staging space for free.

I set it up when I was having a similar problem looking for somewhere to host videos I wanted to include in my PhD thesis and to put my negative data somewhere other than my labbook. Understandably the title confuses people but we can accomodate, spreadsheets, code, media etc

We allow pretty much any filetype to be uploaded and shared and we are looking to visualise as many filetypes as possible in the coming months. There is also version control on the public data which we are working on improving as we speak, as well as an api which we will be testing in the next 2 weeks.

I'd be happy to answer any questions or concerns around the project. Feel free to email me privately if you want to discuss things off the lists.


Thanks a lot,


Mark

I don't understand what figshare.org's value offer is... just hosting?
but only for my graphs/charts? Why would I use this instead of my own
hosting?

Perhaps worth a look:

especially their data publication toolkit:

yes, preprints only.

Hi all,

If you haven't yet heard, this year's Open Knowledge Festival will take
place in Helsinki in September. See: http://okfestival.org/

Plans are currently being developed, and it would be great if we could put
an exciting Open Science and Open Access stream together. We have begun to
outline potential topics and suggest speakers we may wish to invite at
http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest. Please do add your thoughts!

The organising committee have requested that individual streams should have
one or two main contact people, plus a small organising team [see email
below]. I am happy to act as one of the main contact people if you would be
happy with that, and would love a couple of people to join me!

Please let me know if you would like to be involved with the planning at
this stage. To stay in the loop with the organising committee, you can also
join the okfestival-coord mailing list here:
http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/okfestival-coord.

Finally, please do reserve the dates in your diary. We hope that many of
you may be able to join us in Helsinki in September!

All the best,
Laura

To: okfestival-coord at lists.okfn.org



Hello everyone,

About developing the streams further -

Some streams (like Open data in Aid and Development and GLAM) have already
several people involved and some concrete ideas about the format/content of
the stream. Some streams are currently just ideas suggested by someone on
this list.

To get a better overview of the current situation, could you please update
the info about your stream at our Etherpad page:
http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/**helsinki<http://okfestival.okfnpad.org/helsinki>

The format could be something like this:

*# open GLAM / Open Cultural Data
*
short-description-here
Responsible persons (1-2): NNN, ZZZ
People who are willing on be involved in organising this stream: NNN, ZZZ
People interested in this stream: NNN, ZZZ

- - - -

Or alternatively for the streams that are just ideas:

*# name-of-the-stream*
short-description-here
I'm looking for more people to get involved in this - please write your
name + email here, or give a shout on the email list!
Suggested by: NNNN

- - -

It would be great if each stream could nominate 1-2 people to be the main
contact persons, this will make programme planning and various
organisational matters more smooth. And yes, it would be great if each
stream would have one person from Helsinki (or from elsewhere in Finland)
involved.

The programme planning will happen as a dialogue between the organising
committee, advisory board and the groups of people responsible for the
streams. We are currently not sure if we set up a separate programme
planning list, or whether we use this list for the planning discussions.

The OKFest Call for Proposals will be published soon, in the call we will
ask people to give a more concrete suggestion about the format/content of
the stream. When we send out the call we will also give you more
information about the venues we have, and some suggestions of possible
programme formats (we hope that people would suggest some non-traditional
programme formats). Me and other members of the organising team will help
you to make these suggestions, and we can talk about them here.

Best regards,

Juha.

OKfest coordinator / Helsinki

Hi Laura,

I would love to be involved in the planning of the openScience/open access
topic for the OKFest.
Please add me to your list of candidates

Hi All

Some of  you might know of people who would be interested in participating
in the following project - please do circulate!

Jenny

---------------------------------------------

A new Oxford Open Science project is seeking a web designer to create a
visually exciting, dynamic, and easy to use front-end to our online system.

There are presently many exciting projects being pursued worldwide in the
general area of open science: tools for text mining the scientific
knowledge base, bibliographic and referencing systems, citation and impact
analysis tools, project planning systems etc. Our project is based around
creating a common platform where many of these emerging ideas can be
simultaneously presented to users (scientists primarily).

We currently have a team of six individuals including four "back end"
programmers. We are rapidly reaching the point where our system requires a
front end in order to be alpha tested.

You should be familiar with modern web standards such as HTML 5, and be
keen to experiment with new packages.

The project will seek funding from a number of sources, but in the present
phase all project members are working voluntarily. You should have the time
to commit about 5 hours per week.

If you're looking for something to bulk up your CV, or if you're just
interested in getting involved in Open Science, then join us.

Email simon.benjamin at materials.ox.ac.uk to arrange a meeting.

Looks like a good candidate for a Google Summer of Code project, if
you can find a participating organization wanting to take it on.  So a
student could even get paid (by Google) for doing this work.
http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2012

The Climate Code Foundation is taking part in GSoC this year, but this
project looks too far removed from our goals to really fit for us (but
if you know any students interested in climate science, send them to
http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2012/climatecode
).

We must think *strategically* and not *academically*.

It isn't helpful to frame the text mining debate in copyright terms. 
Text mining is a contractual problem, not a copyright problem, but 
because publishers insist on layering text mining prohibitions on top of 
copyright licenses, they have conflated the two in a way that libre open 
access can untangle.

Here's an example of how elsevier does this, but they're hardly alone.
http://www.mpdl.mpg.de/nutzbed/MPG_Elsevier.pdf

Either they have to stop bundling prohibitions on text mining with 
licenses, stop using DRM to enforce prohibitions, and stop chilling bulk 
downloading by text miners without threatening lawsuits (which then we 
can use your arguments to defend, in court, against their army of 
lawyers, using our massive financial advantage as an open movement 
against a bunch of multinational corporations with arms-dealing 
resources), or we need libre OA to include text mining as a strategic 
goal of the overall OA movement.

For me the choice is pretty clear. Expecting publishers to unbundle text 
mining from their licensing agreements and eliminate DRM is magical 
thinking, and the primary legal use arguments for text mining are only 
good as defenses *after* one has been sued, not prospective rights one 
can claim to prevent injunction. See lessig: fair use is the right to 
call a lawyer and nothing more.

We need explicit rights to text mine that obviate the language 
publishers use to prevent it. Leveraging copyright law to prevent them 
from adding those preventions is better strategy than planning to beat 
back the copyright cartel in court, IMHO.

IANAL, YMMV, etc.

Agreed. It is university contracts and publisher robots that stop me
textmining.

Agreed. My own feeling is that we need more than libre OA - we need a
realisation that this is an area we-the-commons, not the publishers,
regulate and I believe we need a clear demarcation of what we can and
cannot do and enforcement when we do what we are allowed to.

We need a political solution where the power is in the hands of the
commons. Quis custodiet ipsos custodes? Certainly not the publishers. But
we manage this in many other areas, medicine, water, education, etc. Not
always as well as we might but a great deal better than the unregulated
digital land grab we have seen.

You betcha. I am involved in a project whose primary product is a collaboratively created database of "things." We are grappling with how to "license" this data. My recommendation is to put it all in the public domain (CC0), but one important db contributor feels that anything more open than a NC-BY equiv will be a non-starter with at least one other important db contributor. Rats!

Well, we can mark each contributor's contributions with their preferred license, and send the license back with every db query, and think our job is done.

Except, we have now passed the burden on to the users, and lumped everyone from a casual user, enthusiast, scholar, a 99 cent mobile app developer and evil-multinational-data-aggregator-reseller all into one big hairball. Because, now when you search for the records using a spatial extent, you are going to get back some records that are going to BY, others, BY-NC, a few others do-whatever-you-want, and god only knows what else.

If I can't convince the team to go CC0 (I will try, but my chances of succeeding are low to none), I need a license that allows me to make distinctions between different users, thereby making it very easy for potential users to understand what they can do with the data.

But, the bigger point is -- I *am* the bloody publisher in this case (whereby "I" I mean, the team of scientists I am working with), and I wish there were some rules to stop me from adding these restrictions. Just saying "nope, you can't restrict your data use" would be so much easier than to try and convince them.

Seriously, sometimes the most difficult players in the game are the scientists themselves.

Not at this time, partly because there aren't any juicy details to share that would shed more light on the issue any more than I have already described, and partly because I might have to go into the witness protection program.

There are very few cases where sharing doesn't make sense, particularly in publicly funded science, and most of them are well-documented (national security, and privacy & security of subjects). This ain't any either one of those.

Suffice it to say -- it is not the evil publishers to be blamed always. Most of the times the enemy is us, the supposedly enlightened ones.

Puneet's story reminds me very much of http://www.morphobank.org/ 's situation.

I've blogged about it before, here:
http://www.science3point0.com/palphy/2011/11/29/research-data-should-be-appropriately-licensed-with-re-use-in-mind/

First, I pointed out to them that need to provide explicit licence
details for the data they provide to avoid confusion.

My recommendation to them was CC-BY or CC0, but it was felt that many
of the 'best' museum institutions that could/ought to contribute data
to their database absolutely won't contribute *anything* under such
permissive licences. [Why this is the case, I do not know, but I
suspect it is true to a certain extent]

So they have adopted a system whereby data depositors can choose from
a range of licences when they click 'publish' (to make the data
publicly-accessible on the site). The trouble is - data depositors may
have misconceptions and misunderstandings about some licences and so
may make an, overly-conservative licence choice.

Given time, it might be interesting as a bit of research to see what
licence each user chose for their data - I'd like to think everyone
would choose CC-BY or CC0 (and some have already) but it'd be
interesting to know percentages...

Best,

Ross

Nope, Scientific Reports fails every single definition of OA. Non 
commercial restrictions = FauxA, not OA. Just because Nature calls it OA 
doesn't make it so, and when an author retains copyrights but not actual 
rights to do stuff, the copyright status is not relevant. Usage is what 
matters, not who the owner is...when the owner has signed away rights to 
allow usage.

The community knows this, which is why SR has just over 300 papers after 
a year and plos one has 14,000+ per year.

NPG has also committed to contributing $20 to Creative Commons for every article CC licensed, which strikes me as a very good role model. So, too, is offering authors a choice of license. Much as I like PLoS, as an author when I get around to publishing I would likely consider Scientific Reports over PLoS ONE because of the license choices.

A related myth is that evil entities will take our noble data, add value to it, and then charge others to use it.

1. If they have indeed added value worth paying for, then all strength to them, and they should be able to charge for it. Looking at it from the other end, no one will add value to it if they don't believe they would somehow benefit from it.

2. If they haven't added value worth paying for and are still charging for them, well then caveat emptor and all that aka "a fool who can't search the web is soon parted from his money."

3. And, finally, the original is still available for free for anyone to use, so no one has been cordoned off from anything.

This myth was possibly what caused OpenStreetMaps to create its original restrictive licensing that they are now trying to shed.

It happens all the time -- we get religion, and we start wanting others to do as we do, little realizing that we end up being no different from those we don't want to be like. It is all the more galling for us in higher research who are most always paid a rather comfortable salary and expenses anyway for our work.

Which is why I decided to go with nothing

Puneet

only partially following this thread however,
your reasoning is acceptable only if the open data set can
be meaningfully queried when published, and it is publishing using a logic
designed to deliver value

 If the open data is dumped in a messy state on the web, nobody can get any
value from it, without being a programmer or knowing what to do with it or
without paying for a third party to make sense of it

Not if the original is 'not usable'  in the first place, (lots of issues to
drill around usability of data) without technical skills, and if the only
usability can be derived from the paying for a third party service -

I can?t tell if you are agreeing or disagreeing with me, and if so, with which point. 

If my original data weren't usable, and you took it, cleaned it up, and offered it for a price, I would be doubly stupid to stop you from doing that. If I were smart, I would get inspired by your work and either entice you to join me, or try to make my original data even better so folks would continue to come to my source. 

And, if my original data were usable to begin with, you would have to offer some *really* good added value for someone to pony up money for your version.

Competition is good for everyone, even for those offering stuff for free.

the point here, without a minimum standard requirement for
usability/usefulness of open data, public authorities can publish
rubbish datasets, all paid with public money, and be proud of it (which is
what we are seeing right now)

I am not trying to stop anyone make the data more useful, but I am trying
to stop public administrations making publishing open data
that is not useful at all to anyone  in the first place, and then boasting
that they are avant garde

Appropriate design considerations should be made

this is such an ego centric stance, I am very very cautios when someone
insists I depend on their private service to make sense  and use of public
data set (red flag here). It looks like your motive here is not the public
good, but to show how smart your are.

I do not appreciate this CC-BY bashing. I do not think that we need a
copyright - at least in scholarly context - which gives an author the
absolute control over his text in order to prevent all uses he
dislikes. CC-BY is the only BOAI/Berlin/Bethesda compliant license.
Does anybody have an estimate how many scientists worldwide have
published at least one article in a CC-BY journal from PLoS, BMC etc.?
I would guess: more than 50.000.

People like Ms Morrison or Mr Thatcher have few understanding of the
CC license. May I remember my blog entry on the "Greener Journals" at
http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/64979561/ and the legal code of CC-BY
which reads: "Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or
as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of
any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation."

I'm going by the BBB declarations.

Budapest: only role for copyright is attribution (not commercial 
restriction as in CC NC licenses, and one might even argue, not 
share-alike to compel behavior in derived works either, though that's 
more debated).

Bethesda and Berlin: The author(s) and copyright holder(s) grant(s) to 
all users a free, irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual right of access to, 
and a license to copy, use, distribute, transmit and display the work 
publicly and to make and distribute derivative works, in any digital 
medium for any responsible purpose, subject to proper attribution of 
authorship[2], as well as the right to make small numbers of printed 
copies for their personal use.

Note: "all users" doesn't include permission to say "no commercial users".

I have personally bought text mining services from multiple companies, 
both in my commercial startup days (would have been a violation of the 
NC clause) and while building the initial corpus behind the Neurocommons 
(see corpus at http://neurocommons.org/page/Text_processing_pilot built 
using Temis commercial software and services, of which the latter would 
definitely violate NC clauses).

I also know that for-profit companies like pharmaceutical organizations 
fall under assertions of commercial use under BY NC all the time, and 
based on personal conversations I have had around the adoption of 
scientific reports, I know that the restriction of text mining is one of 
the specific reasons for the adoption of the NC clause.

Scientific reports is free of cost, but it is far from an open access 
journal. Copies of the papers may be deposited in repositories, and 
those copies qualify under Berlin and Bethesda as green / gratis OA, but 
that doesn't make the journal itself OA any more than being allowed to 
archive out of a toll based journal makes that journal OA itself.

This is why it's important to keep the definitions clear. Gratis OA is 
about archives, not journals. Journals are adopting the rhetoric of 
gratis OA and co-opting the libre OA in the definitions. I personally 
think that's bad. Your mileage may vary.

Thanks John, [and Klaus] and so am I.

I'm happy to see robust discussion on this list - we should avoid flame
wars.

It's somewhat unfortunate that there seems an operational division between
science and humanities. It would be nice to have a one-size-fits all for
"Open Access" but the reality may evolve to be different. The
Harnad-Morrison-Thatcher approach could be summed up as:
* the primary goal is that humans can somehow find a Gratis copy of the
work to read with their eyes. It is of secondary importance whether the
community has any rights.

The science community on the other hand wishes to make complete use of the
complete scholarly literature using modern technology to discover, index,
extract, re-use, recompute, re-assemble in whatever way their imagination
and technology runs to. (I wish to build an artificially intelligent
chemical amanuensis by semantic analysis of the complete literature, for
example).
* ANY licence other than BBB-compliant prevents this ABSOLUTELY. Any
publisher's contract prevents this absolutely.

It is profoundly unhelpful to this cause to have people pontificating about
absolute author's rights and quasi-religious approaches to solving the
problem. Harnad and Morrison know nothing about high-throughput textmining,
data extraction, eigenvector-based indexing, etc. If they wish to publish
their own work under NC I shan't fight it.

UK/PubMedcentral is crippled by the lack of explicit full-libre permission
to re-use it. 20 million scientific articles of which about 1% are legally
minable and those are extremely difficult to discover. I spent my
"research" effort trying to find these, rather than actually DOING the
science from them. Last week my tools read 500,000 chemical reactions from
the patent literature, better as well as infinitely faster than any human
on the planet. Those reactions can help to find new drugs, new ways of
making drugs, new insights into chemistry.

The reality is that science can operate extremely well with CC-BY. I am yet
again preparing a clutch of articles for Biomed Central (a special issue
with 17 APC-based articles). BMC have been running for 10 years. As far as
I know there have been no serious misuse of the literature so there is no
need to "protect" CC-BY.

On a related point, institutional repositories are almost completely
useless for modern literature analysis. They do not carry explicit
machine-readable libre licences so we cannot by right use any of their
content. They are fragmented - instead of the UK having ONE repository (say
in the BL) which would be the rational thing that any scientist would do
they are fragmented over 200 universities at great additional cost.

Al that leads up to me thanking the RCUK for insisting on CC-BY and - with
other scientific organizations such as Wellcome, and the Libre science
publishers - making BBB-OpenAccess a reality. There is a great deal more to
do, but at least we have a model that works and that politicians are
listening to.

I realize that I didn't make my point clear enough actually.

And I don't lump Heather in with Harnard. Heather asked a good question 
that I answered obliquely. For that I apologize.

I do not just want the ability for academics to text mine. I want there 
to be a robust market for text mining that includes companies who mine 
open access content for their own reasons as well as academics, and I 
want there to be a robust market of startups who provide those text 
mining services (and thus must make and distribute copies of corpuses as 
validation sets, as part of collaborations with academics that improve 
algorithms, and who also produce and sell the outputs of text mining). 
Right now text mining pretty much sucks, frankly, compared to what it 
ought it be.

Non commercial licenses are not just a way to prevent other publishers 
from reselling content, which is often the focus of the conversation, 
but a tax on startups and companies who want to treat the literature as 
data. Here's a short list of companies trying to do just that who are 
being hamstrung by closed access, and who would be blocked under NC 
terms: Personalized Medicine (providing auto-annotation of genotypes to 
doctors' offices), Selventa (providing auto-created hypotheses 
explaining high throughput experimental biological data), Ingenuity 
(providing large databases of assertions specific to diseases or 
tissues). Those three are simply the first ones that jump to mind in 
startup land. There's ~20 more I know of, and many more that I don't.

The uncertainty around content chills venture investment, to boot. If 
the web had been NC licensed, we would not have google, and pagerank 
would have remained where it started as an academic theory experiment. 
That would suck, in my opinion. And the big publishers know this, which 
is precisely why they add clauses that ban mining to existing licenses 
and want commercial restrictions. I don't think they're worried about 
resale. I think they're worried about getting their lunch eaten by new 
entrants who see the market differently, as Apple did with music, as 
Google did to Microsoft (and in turn Facebook did to Google). That's why 
Elsevier has an entire unit devoted to this stuff, run by extremely 
smart people.

Then there's all of big pharma and biotech, who all maintain libraries 
and subscriptions, but are often absent from these discussions because 
of their position on patents.

Non commercial restrictions have *side effects* that are bad for 
innovation and bad for science. We need entrepreneurs and not just 
academics.

This is not nearly as much of a problem in the humanities on first 
blush, but the reality is that as text mining gets better, faster, 
cheaper, and more subtle in the hard sciences, it will bring amazing 
tools to the humanities as well.

I was probably simplistic as well.  But, unfortunately, there is a large
section of academia that creates "Open Access" policy implicitly and
explicitly and very little of it is informed by scientists. There are 1000+
institutional repositories (Peter Suber figure) with ca 2 FTE per repo == >
2000 FTEs and very little of this investment is informed by scientist needs.

Exactly. The whole point is that a bright small group can create great
tools and information in months. 3 of our group have done this - but none
can be properly deployed as we have to fight restrictive practices.

Yes. It is a serious mistake to assume Elsevier is stupid or incompetent. I
suspect they are unprepared in some technical areas as they hope to avoid

And they lead to bad  decision making at all levels of science - the
information doesn't get through. People often need the literature to be
push'ed to them, not just pull'ed. You cannot push NC material and you
cannot push Green material. It's only used by those who know

FWIW: in the software world there is no such thing as an NC license.
At least no OSI-approved one. And for good reasons.

As obvious as this may be to those in the business ...

I agree: a single institutional repository is probably going to take
at least 2 FTEs.  But essentially all of the technical work being done
by those two could be shared by many, many IRs.  So the cost of the
IRs is a linear function of the capacity.  Consider: how many FTEs run
the arXiv?  How many would it be if every university had their own
arXiv?

I don't think that the remote possibility of something being
republished in dubious places is a justification for imposing any
restriction in addition to attribution.

Suppose your article from a CC BY journal is republished by some of
the predators. In that case, they have to obey the licensing
requirements and clearly identify the source and the license of the
source, in which case it would be clearly visible that that is just a
copy, and nobody would suspect you of taking the light road of
publishing your research there.

If they do not meet the requirements of the license, that would be a
copyright violation. Adding restrictions to the licensing of the
source would not change any of that and just add complexity.

May I again point to:

http://archiv.twoday.net/stories/64979561/

I think it is a very stupid argument that some misuse is discrediting
use. Is the existence of so called "predatory OA publisher's"
discrediting OA?

It's illegal to hide CC-BY contributions behind a pawywall. See the
legal code of CC-BY: "When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the
Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License."

If it's illegal the author can fight against it - in and outside the courts.

Who has ever said that CC misuses are'nt possible?

It remains a "remote possibility".

Some of these will be awesome and an improvement over what we have now - others will deserve to be on Beall's list.

You should read the whole text:

"You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
Section 4(b), as requested."

I cannot see that this legitimates a paywalled use. It's absolutely
not helpful to distribute misunderstandings of CC.

>>>>>>> My comments on this topic, from my response to the RCUK new draft open access policy:
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Kudos to RCUK for adopting a leadership position on libre open access. ?However, I would recommend against specifying the Creative Commons CC-BY license. While many open access advocates understandably see CC-BY as the expression of the BOAI definition of open access, my considered opinion is that CC-BY is a weak license for libre OA which fails to protect OA downstream and will not accomplish the Budapest vision of open access,. My perspective is that the best license for libre open access is Creative Commons - Attribution - Noncommercial - Sharealike (CC-BY-NC-SA), as this protects OA downstream (recognizing that the current CC NC definition is problematic, and noting that commercial rights should be retained by authors, not publishers). As one example of where open access might need such protection, because CC-BY allows for resale of open access materials: if all of PubMedCentral were CC-BY, a commercial company could copy the whole thing, perhaps add some value, and sell their version of PMC. They could not legally stop PMC from providing free access. However, I very much doubt that CC-BY could prevent such a company from lobbying to remove funding for the public version. If this sounds ludicrous and unconscionable, may I present as evidence that just such a scenario is realistic: 1) the efforts a few years ago by the American Chemical Society to prevent the U.S. government from providing PubChem on the grounds that this was competition with a private entity; 2) the Research Works Act, and 3) the current anti-FRPAA lobbying in the U.S., which, similarly to the Research Works Act, claims that published research funded by the public is "private research works" which should belong solely to the publisher.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> Another reason for avoiding CC-BY is that while the contributions of funders are very important, so are the contributions of scholar authors. Many scholars do not wish to see others who have contributed nothing to a scholarly work sell their work and pocket the money; I certainly don't. For example, Peter Suber recently posted this note to the SPARC Open Access Forum which expresses the distress of an author who published CC-BY in a BMC journal and then found a bogus publisher selling her article for $3. https://groups.google.com/a/arl.org/group/sparc-oaforum/browse_thread/thread/fc977cabd0d59bcc#. The more work that is published CC-BY, the more I believe we can expect ?to see this kind of scam, and this risks turning researchers off OA. Also, when faculty members develop their own open access policies (e.g. Harvard, MIT), they insist that articles not be sold for a profit. Links to these and other institutional repositories are available through the Registry of Open Access Material Archiving Policies (ROARMAP) at http://roarmap.eprints.org/.
>>>>>>>
>>>>>>> To illustrate how CC-BY does not necessarily result in the Budapest open access initative's vision of "sharing of the poor with the rich and the rich with the poor": those who give away their work for commercial purposes may not be able to afford the results. For example, if a scholar from a poorer area gives away their medical articles as CC-BY, images and other elements from these articles could be used to develop point-of-care tools that could be sold at prices that the health care professionals serving the scholar and their families could not afford. That is, despite the best of intentions, CC-BY could easily result in a one-way sharing of the poor with the rich. This is one of the reasons why I strongly recommend that the developing world avoid CC-BY.

Message-ID: <CACsOGbPLOYKooFMcFWXW7-XL-0hAucd+7MMGMo-Vcf9=Wkqv7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All, (xpost to okfn-labs)

I just deployed a online version of my new project notebook.js:
http://notebookjs.me/

If you want to get an idea of the finished result, check this
notebook: http://notebookjs.me/#load/examples/tut_web.notebook
(but you should really check all the tutorials).

The idea is to allow the creation of literate analysis in the browser
using code.

At the moment, the demo is set up to run entirely in your browser
using local storage and web workers.

I have tested with firefox & chrome, YMMV.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

It looks very impressive.  Any comment on IPython notebook?:

http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html
http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/mar-12/ipython-notebook-intro-screencast.html

Any way of sharing work to you think?

Best,

Matthew

I hope so, yes.  I think the ipython stuff is great, and they have a
solid approach.  I wanted to approach it from the frontend back and
hopefully reuse by connecting to an ipython notebook via websocket
(which they already provide).

I was heavily influenced by the development of codenode as well, which
I took part in.  I was focused on making a nice frontend for viewing
and sharing work that could hopefully use different backends.  So I
would be interested in seeing if we can find common ground in an web
socket engine protocol.  But the main challenge here was to define an
application which runs entirely locally - so you can run this program
without a server and therefore reproduce someones work on your
machine.

Yes, the normalization is not correct, I think!

Just to mention that I'm involved in IPython development, if anyone on
the list has questions or suggestions about the notebook (or any part
of IPython).

The messaging format that IPython uses is described here:
http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/development/messaging.html .
It's predictable enough that there are now at least 6 clients which
can connect to an IPython kernel - three maintained by IPython
(qtconsole, notebook, alternative terminal interface) and three
external (vim-ipython, PTVS, IDLE-X).

Hey James,
it looks pretty cool.

Just two quick suggestions:

1. Should be possible to delete a cell, especially if too many were introduced.
2. Make more clear the change between Javascript/Markdown changing
also the background of the label as well.

Nice work, I really like the idea of a local application, written in html5.

Ok,

I found out that is possible to remove the cell
http://notebookjs.me/#ed3fbe07-f31d-f917-2986-35628a1c82ae/view/

There is a typo in the tutorial s/remote/remove/

Cheers,
Michele.

Does not open for me either (chrome/firefox, California).

On this topic of interactive notebooks & open science, I recently came
across http://www.runmycode.org, which will allow readers to run code from
published articles and working papers interactively on the browser,
changing the input parameters, data etc.  This is aimed at the economics
community, but a nice demonstration that (a) it can be done (b) people will
take the time to use it.

not resolving.

Thanks, really useful link.  I had been reading the source to try and
grok the protocol, but this is good.

Is there a similar link for the notebook serialisation format?

Hi Jessy,

Thanks for trying.   Sorry to have let you down!

This could well have been a DNS propagation problem.  Could I ask you
if it is resolving today?  Does the site display?

Nothing like as detailed, since we're not currently prepared for other
implementations to use the files without going through IPython, but
there's a brief description:

http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/htmlnotebook.html#the-notebook-format

The code that handles the notebook format is here - note that the
format itself is versioned, and we're currently on version 3:
https://github.com/ipython/ipython/tree/master/IPython/nbformat

Message-ID: <0DBF2BD4A4CE9B45B8A90A65CD8338EA04B3EB2A@SEGBLOGR0008.springer-sbm.com>

Dear Open Science friends,

 

There are still a few days left to nominate an article for the 2011 Open
Data award. The winner will be announced on 17th May 2012.

 

More information here:

http://blogs.openaccesscentral.com/blogs/bmcblog/entry/countdown_to_the_
data_oscars

 

The criteria for the Open Data Award
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/researchawards/awardcategories#Open_Data>
are:
"Data sharing, its preservation and re-use, is an increasingly important
part of scientific research and the publication process but there are
many challenges associated with openly sharing scientific data,
particularly when sharing goes against cultural or community norms. We
recognize researchers who have published in BioMed Central journals and
have demonstrated leadership in the sharing, standardization,
publication, or re-use of biomedical research data."

 

The article must have been published in a BioMed Central or Chemistry
Central journal in 2011 to qualify.

 

Any suggestions please email me directly.

 

Best regards,

 

Iain

Thanks Diane.

Laura,

Could you please set up stage for working towards Open Research Data
Handbook.

What you say? we should post about this in various forums so that all
others who are interested in this activity would join us?

Thanks & Regards

Hi All

This sounds like a great idea and I think we need a few more people to get
it going, I'm happy to help coordinate so I'll add myself to Laura's list :)


* Daniel Dietrich (general coord; OKFN Germany)
* Laura Newman (general coord; OKFN UK)
* Sridhar Gutam
* Carolina Odman
* Paola di Maio
* Peter Murray-Rust (?)
* Jenny Molloy

We were discussing making this a sprint project at OKFest with people
adding to a handbook throughout OKCon, but it definitely wouldn't hurt to
start work beforehand!

I think it ties nicely into an earlier thread on an early-career guide to
doing open science (starting here
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2012-March/001427.html) and a
suggestion at the last wg meeting from Jessy Schlinger that we should get
people using open science tools and generating feedback, writing reviews
etc as part of an interactive session at OKFest but also more generally.

I've copied Jessy's email about what P2PU are already doing on this front
and I think we should definitely team up with them.

This could all be tied into one big handbook including reviews of the tools
available, with some edited highlights for particular groups of
researchers, including grads and early career researchers if there are
specific needs to address. With the rate of progress in open science, it
would need to be frequently updated living document.

Jenny

hey guys,

this doesn't solve the repository problem, but is in response to the
original subject line: "early career guide to doing open science."

as some of you know the peer to peer university <http://p2pu.org/> is
currently experimenting with peer-based learning using teams (study groups,
courses), challenges, and badges. there's been a lot of discussion around
open research and open science at, as something that a) p2pu is trying to
encourage for research done about p2pu initiatives, b) we would like to
encourage more open research BY p2pu community and others (not necessarily
about learning) and c) involves but also has some different elements from
peer-based learning alone.

we've started working on a core set of "open science
challenges<http://pad.p2pu.org/p/opensciencecontent>"
that we would incorporate into the challenges infrastructure at p2pu (or
anywhere really, it's just what's available :)). my hope is that they could
capture some of the core processes and activities of basic research,
provide links to useful tools and initiatives, and incorporate open
practice in a way that "just makes sense." it would aim to provide a clear
place to get started practicing open science, based on the experience of
others, without having to re-derive that process every time. and finally,
with enough help, we can have some mentorship in that process too.

this would be great, as tom said, for newish grad students and researchers
- but IMHO also for opening up the actual core elements of the scientific
process, with the idea that anyone can participate - even the so-called
#sholarlypoor.

i would love it if people had ideas and suggestions to improve, rip apart,
clean up, extend, etc. these challenges. i was actually planning to email
this list as i know that people like carl, peter, cameron etc. are all both
practitioners and thought leaders in this area.

for example, a great one to add from this discussion would be one on
repositories and open data. there are currently two relevant challenges
already started: "develop a documentation plan" and "make your results,
data available to others" that could really be fleshed out.

i am happy to volunteer to take any raw notes people put in there and
incorporate them into prose for challenges. and we are also very interested
in general feedback, ideas and participation

thanks!
jessy

Hi Jack,

I had a look on http://www.whatsmydns.net/#CNAME/notebookjs.me and it
seems that DNS is fine around the globe.

You can also get to it via the heroku url:
http://floating-fire-3719.herokuapp.com/

If you try that and it doesn't work, it's definitely not DNS.  In
which case, which browser are you using?

That link worked!
The other one still does not load. I've tested on chrome and firefox
on macbook and win7, and just now safari on macbook: no cigar!

But, now I can see the platform.

Many thanks
Jack

Now that I can see it and play with it, I am reminded of Ward
Cunningham's new project:

http://wardcunningham.github.com/

noteboookjs does literate programming. The only other LP interface
I've seen of late is embedded in HypergraphDB
http://www.kobrix.com/hgdb.jsp


Thanks!
Jack

It is true that a lot of IRs aren't currently equipped to handle some of
the very specific needs of scientists, but a lot of university libraries
ARE uniquely equipped to handle general long term data storage and
preservation. Further to that, they're staffed with librarians who have a
goal of curating and preserving data (not just for current but also future
generations) in mind, and who are really eager to work with researchers.

It seems to me that we should be collaborating to adapt the tools we have
to the needs of scientists (or providing the infrastructure for agile
platform development, like Puneet suggested last week), instead of
constantly reinventing the wheel within our respective silos. As someone
who straddles the IR Librarian/Scientist divide, it confounds me how often
librarians dismiss researchers as not wanting to put in any effort to help
shape the direction of the IR, while at the same time researchers dismiss
librarians as not building tools that they need.

One more point: I'd also disagree that 2 FTE could handle the needs of more
than one repository at a time. In working for repositories that have both
enterprise platforms (BePress) and open source platforms (DSpace), I can
tell you that in both cases it takes a lot of administrative personpower to
manage an IR, in addition to developer hours. Hearing Oya Rieger
(arXiv.org/Cornell Libraries) speak at the RDAP meeting last week about
sustaining arXiv drove this home for me.

Let's not forget that though arXiv was started by a scientist and
originally housed at a national lab, it is through the support of the
Cornell Libraries that it remains alive today.

They won't allow that, because they know someone would just torrent it
immediately. There are ways to detect and remove watermarks. I don't think
they'd go for that. DeepDyve is not really a solution... they just post up
images of all their papers, and then charge you per-paper accessed anyway.
But on top of that, they go ahead and make it into an image (rather than a
file with words), which makes it even more useless without OCR or
something. blah

I'm a big fan of librarians, and I agree that the skills and expertise
of librarians may be valuable to a repository.  But: how many FTEs run
arXiv?  Hosting how many papers, increasing at what rate?  How do the
per-FTE numbers for arXiV compare to the IR at your institution?

As for "general long term data storage and preservation", the key
motto for more than a decade has been "to keep it, keep it spinning."

Hi everyone,

I agree that this is a really great idea with lots of potential. In
particular, I really like the idea of linking up with P2PU.

I have a busy couple of days ahead, and need to do a bit of 'mental
cooking'! In the meantime, I suggest we start brainstorming ideas. I have
booted up an etherpad. Please do add specific content suggestions, useful
resources, links, ideas - anything really!

http://science.okfnpad.org/researchdatahandbook

Jenny and I had discussed creating material for this Handbook at OKFest in
September - but if we can begin earlier, that would be even better!

Great to see so much enthusiasm here, I'm really excited about this concept
:)

All the best,
Laura

Subject: [open-science] OKFest - Call for Proposals
Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMYbf9sN6X0oWzBdp9jZ6W7nJdibP_+pyT_Nk9m1RW9z=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

As many of you may have spotted, the Call for Proposals for OKFest was
officially launched today! You can read's Kat's blog post here:

http://blog.okfn.org/2012/03/28/okfestival-call-for-proposals-released-with-a-twist/

We should definitely propose an Open Science stream. The deadline for
proposals is 20th April. You can see the format our proposal will need to
take here:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGY5bTNkT05wd2ZkUS1EZktJVFE4UGc6MQ

The etherpad we began planning on is actually looking pretty healthy. Many
thanks to everyone who has contributed already. It would be great to get as
many ideas down there as possible before we submit the proposal though, so
do take a minute to have another look. In particular, they are keen for
sessions to take place in various formats, not just the traditional talk /
panel. We've had a couple of ideas for hands on drafting and tool-testing
sessions, but do keep thinking and suggesting! The etherpad is here:

http://science.okfnpad.org/OKFest

I have rearranged the original text to fit the form for the OKFest Call for
Proposals. Please add, comment and edit away!

I have included the formal text for the Call for Proposals below this email.

Thanks everyone!
Laura



OPEN KNOWLEDGE FESTIVAL - CALL FOR PROPOSALS*

First Round Deadline: April 20th 2012
Second Round Deadline: June 1st 2012

*OPEN KNOWLEDGE FESTIVAL*

We are delighted to announce that this year?s Open Government Data Camp and
Open Knowledge Conference are joining to form a week-long celebration: the
*Open Knowledge Festival*!

This pioneering event will include an action-packed week of lectures,
seminars, workshops, hackathons, coding jams, and interactive sessions that
will bring together individuals and organizations from a wide variety of
backgrounds to exchange ideas, make things and meet new people. OKFest will
also highlight the diversity of Finland?s open knowledge communities to a
new international audience, with a specific effort to encourage the
participation of representatives from Nordic nations.

Join us in Helsinki, Finland on 17-22 of September 2012 for a week of open
knowledge and global inspiration.

*THEME: OPEN KNOWLEDGE IN ACTION*

The 2012 theme of OKFestival is *Open Knowledge in Action*. We will focus
on the /value/that can be generated by opening up knowledge, the ecosystems
of organisations that benefit from and participate in sharing, and the
impact that open knowledge can have in our societies. What kinds of new
professions, ideas and community initiatives can emerge within our
governments, markets, networks and neighbourhoods as a result of these
engagements?

The exploration of this theme will not only be visible in the festival?s
content, but also in its implementation as the first global event of its
kind. At OKFestival, we will experiment with new forms of collaboration,
new workshop formats and new forms of participation. We?ll bring together
civil society representatives, programmers, data wranglers, designers,
students, members of government and local communities for a week of
building new things and sharing great ideas.

*CALL FOR PROPOSALS*

We have *two submission deadlines*this Spring based on our venue capacity
at the *Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture*in
Helsinki. We suggest applying as soon as possible in order to ensure
adequate venue space, support and funding for your proposals.

First Round Deadline: April 20th 2012
Second Round Deadline: June 1st 2012

We are looking for proposals related to specific open knowledge and open
data topics, but also new viewpoints and cross-cutting issues which may
help us to understand how open knowledge is working in our society.
Examples of such topics are the well-being of communities, civil society
and citizen empowerment, democracy, entrepreneurship, smart cities,
sustainability etc.

Unfortunately not (or not without digging into the DB directly which
would be pretty painful).

hey all,

some ideas on the open science front specifically, riffing off of the
"experimental" format a bit:

open notebook practitioners - workshop and feedback session
- required to have an open notebook or commit to creating one to attend :)
- discuss form, content, composability, discoverability, lessons
learned, etc.
- how can we better link together/leverage work being put in the open by
open researchers?

research statement video booth!
- get open science practitioners to record a < 1m video of their research
interests/research statement, and put them online.
- can also talk about value they derived from using x,y,z open science
tools/practices.
- get people excited about playing with open science tools, humanize and
make science approachable

science markup - design session (or maybe a debate style?)
- using RDF(a)/microdata to make science on the web more discoverable.
- what structure would people find useful
- what efforts have been attempted and failed/petered out and why?
- how/would they use such things?
- what authoring tools and plugins could exist to support it.

just brainstorming... not sure if any of those pique others' interests...

Jessy, list,

These sound great to me, you've piqued my interest.

I'm continually evolving my open notebook system (which of course I
try to document
in the notebook<http://www.carlboettiger.info/archives/category/ons-thoughts>,
in between the science posts) and would love to bounce ideas off of other
practitioners more often.  I'm particularly interested in how to keep
content clean enough to be intelligible, complete enough to be
reproducible, while also keeping the process simple/automatic enough to
actually be doable (i.e. save time instead of take extra time).

I think it's also a good platform to experiment with the science markup
concepts you mention.

-Carl

Dear All

A good while ago the idea was floated that we should change our name from
our official title of the 'Working Group on Open Data in Science' (
http://blog.okfn.org/2009/03/13/working-group-on-open-data-in-science/) to
the 'Open Science Working Group' to reflect our expanding membership and
broadening scope.

I think the time has come for this switch as it's reached the stage where
Open Data in Science, while very much at the heart of the group, is by no
means our sole focus anymore.

Most of our online presence is already using Open Science because it's
shorter for URLs so this shouldn't cause too much confusion!

Does anyone have any objections?

Jenny

And Jenny is already promoting the Open Science meme in Oxford with monthly
meetings.

Certainly no objections, as long as it's made clear that Open Data is one
of our core topics.
We don't want to become, or more importantly, be seen as *yet another Open
Access advocacy group *

Which is why we have @ccess http://access.okfn.org/ to focus on OA :)

Definitely open data will still be key, but open science means we include
those people interested in citizen cyberscience, open collaboration
projects, open notebooks, open scientific code and the many other open
science topics members are working on.

Besides, we're not just an advocacy group because we also make cool stuff...
That is a nudge for everyone to join in the hackday
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-mar12 :)
