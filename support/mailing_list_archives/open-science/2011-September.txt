Hi Peter

There isn't currently any preparation underway but we certainly could.
Would anyone else be interested in contributing?
We can set up a pad and perhaps arrange a Skype call if there are takers!

I had a long talk with Stuart Dempster of JISC and I may be asked to
contribute something there. However I think OKF should have a submission
even if it's quite small. I'd be OK to be called this evening -

Message-ID: <CABPM+wqf4Yj=oE=-Z-r1VmvMOYioG85Rk9sj7O7A9=nXWpSWaA@mail.gmail.com>

Good news!

You may remember there was a conversation on the working group list
regarding proposing an open data session at ESOF 2012.

Well, a few of us put our heads together at OKCon for a last minute
submission http://okfnpad.org/esof2012proposal * and I'm pleased to
say we've been shortlisted :)
As I say, this was pretty last minute so I'm sure it can be improved
upon and now is the opportunity to do so before the final decision
round. Any comments on the pad/list or offers of assistance from those
who might be at ESOF are very welcome!

We're hoping to make some cool drawings as per the Open Metadata
workshop described in this blog post
http://blog.okfn.org/2011/06/24/notes-from-open-metadata-workshop-hague-15th-june-2011/
so if you know of anyone with advanced doodling skills and an interest
in open data in science, let me know!

Jenny

* this was a draft, I'll update with what was actually put on the form
asap but it wasn't much different.

To: "jenny.molloy at zoo.ox.ac.uk" <jenny.molloy at zoo.ox.ac.uk>


Dear Jennifer,

Thank you for submitting a proposal for the ESOF 2012 Science
Programme under the following title:

Hands off my data! Is science ready to open up?

?Our call for proposals was a huge success and Dublin is now shaping
up to be the biggest and best ESOF to date.? Due to the fact that we
received an unprecedented number of high quality proposals, over 400,
the review process has been quite lengthy and we appreciate your
patience during this time.

I am delighted to inform you that following an initial review by the
International Programme Committee your proposal has been shortlisted
for the ESOF 2012 science programme.

A second review of the proposals on the shortlist will now take place,
from which around 70 proposals will be selected for inclusion in the
ESOF 2012 programme.

You now have the opportunity to make amendments to your proposal
before the next review. If you wish to do so please log on to your
account on the ESOF database at www.esof.eu/hub

Please take note of the following when considering changes to your proposal:

????????? Would the proposal benefit from a sharper focus?

????????? Does the proposal need to be broadened to include another
dimension? Either discipline or country perspective.

????????? Does the format allow for audience interaction?

????????? Is the proposal balanced in terms of speakers? gender and nationality?

????????? Is it evident from the abstract how the topic will be
presented? (e.g. what perspective, what format)

????????? Are there too many or too few speakers on the panel? (note 4
speakers is optimal)

Please also take this opportunity to update your speaker profiles.

If more than one proposal from your institution has been submitted on
a similar topic please consider merging them into one proposal. It is
unlikely that two very similar proposals will be accepted on to the
programme due to the large number of high quality proposals that have
been received.

After you have made your changes please click on the green button
?submit to programme committee? on the right hand side of your screen.

The deadline for amendments is September 15th at 12 noon GMT.

It should be noted that revising your proposal at this stage does not
guarantee acceptance on to the programme. You will be informed of the
Programme Committee?s final decision in mid-October.

If you no longer want to be considered for review please email the
project team directly: info at esof2012.org otherwise we will assume that
you still want your proposal to be considered for review.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact us at
info at esof2012.org or call +353 1 6073044

We look forward to seeing you in Dublin for ESOF 2012.

Kind regards,

Emma

Hi All

Diane kindly drafted a response to the Hargreaves Report which Peter fleshed
out at Science Online London (Peter - I made your text third person, hope
that's OK!)
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hargreaves

Does anyone else have any experiences they would like to share?
Particularly, your own experiences of trying to use data/text mining in your
research and barriers due to copyright, along with any points that address
Cameron's request for evidence below.

From:  <cameron.neylon at stfc.ac.uk>
Date: Fri, Aug 12, 2011 at 9:20 AM
<>
I've been approached to see if we can pull some more concrete evidence
together to bolster the case. In particular we need any evidence of
_specific_ damage. Things not done that could be done (ideally even under an
NC regime) and things that _very clearly would_ happen if the proposed rules
go through. Also any economic modelling on the benefits under either an NC
or fully open regime would be very useful. Comments from highly successful
overseas researchers or professionals who would shift their operation to the
UK if such a system were brought in would also be useful.
<>

If any working group members have an objection to the position we are taking
or take issue with some of the points and would like to encourage
discussion, then do send your views to the list!

Many thanks

----Draft
Open Knowledge Foundation['s Open Science working group] strongly supports
the Government response to the Hargreaves Review of Intellectual Property
and Growth and encourages follow through on it's many excellent proposals.
As scientists and scholars, we are both creators and users of intellectual
property.  Our creations, however, only expand in value when they are shared
with other researchers.  Our data becomes exponentially more useful when
combined with the data of others.  It is this benefit to science that is the
core value which copyright law is intended to protect but which currently
delays effective re-use of research results in the current digital
environment.  We encourage adaptation of the law to benefit the progress of
science and we feel that the ability to freely use research data will
benefit science as well as creators of scientific work product.

In particular, the [OKF] Open Science group strongly urges implementation of
Recommendation 5 to allow specific exceptions in copyright law for data and
text mining.  We agree with the Government's opinion that regard it as
inappropriate "for certain activities of public benefit such as medical
research obtained through text mining to be in effect subject to veto by the
owners of copyrights in the reports of such research, where access to the
reports was obtained lawfully."  Nor are we persuaded that restricting such
transformative use is necessary or in the UK?s overall scientific, much less
economic interests.

[Insert quote from PMR or OKF explaining why data mining helps researchers,
e.g., negative cost, burden of permissioning, metrics/examples of data
mining uses in research]

I have nipped through fixing typos.

Niggles which I haven't fixed:

"It is this benefit to science that is the core value which copyright law is
intended to protect"
Is it?

Should "Murray Rust" be hyphenated?  Should "Group" be capitalized in
"Murray Rust Group"?

This sentence isn't a sentence: "The results of this analysis can be highly
valuable for drug design but extending the dataset ."

"prevented by contract, on top of any copyright." -> "on top of any
restrictions imposed by the copyright holder."

 "proprietary APIs"might be slightly too technical for the audience.

Hi All

Just a reminder about tonight's meeting! It should be a good one, we
have Joseph Jackson (organiser of the Open Science Summit) joining us
to discuss the launch of the Open Science Alliance and how we could
work together with this new initiative. They have some exciting
projects planned including a hackathon, developer competition and
documentary!

Beijing timezone allowing, Francois Grey from the Citizen Science
Centre at CERN will also be joining to discuss increasing activity on
open-science-dev, a citizen science hackfest and the possibility of a
project involving the WHO.

Do drop in if you can (instructions below)

Dear all, dear Jenny,


Daniel Mietchen, Adrian Pohl and me answered  the consultation on behalf 
of the German OKFN chapter. As the consultation closes tomorrow anyone 
seeking inspiration might have a look at our results. The answers differ 
a little from Daniel's draft.

Our proposal can be found here: http://wiki.okfn.de/OA_EC


best regards


Uli

This could be interesting for us. We should get rights defined in this.

P.


Data Intensive Science Request for Ideas
http://dis.ideascale.com/

The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation's Science Program is seeking the
community's feedback on where to invest in the area of data-intensive
science. We would appreciate your good ideas, and your thoughts on other's
ideas, from now through the middle of September, 2011. The Science Program
will review these ideas and incorporate them into this year's strategic
planning.

The increasing volume and complexity of scientific data are overwhelming
current research practices, and create additional barriers to an already
challenged science infrastructure, workforce and funding landscape. Many
agencies and foundations are looking at ways to best combat the growing wave
of challenges caused by today?s data deluge, and the Gordon and Betty Moore
Foundation?s RFI on Data Intensive Science is intended to add to this
growing body of thinking. This RFI is being conducted in the open and for
the benefit of anyone looking to navigate these areas. The Gordon and Betty
Moore Foundation Science Program only funds natural and applied science
research, we request that ideas related to domain specific challenges stay
within these fields.

We welcome your participation in this effort. The intention in 2011 is to
create a focused strategy in data-intensive science that strongly
complements funding by government agencies, other foundations and private
industry. We are leaving the definition of "data-intensive science" open,
except to say that it is not intended to encompass "big data" exclusively.

To submit an idea, please go to http://dis.ideascale.com/, sign up, and
enter your idea.

Subject: [open-science] Open Science at the British Ecological Society
	annual meeting
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzTdyB53jdK13jj9uAOeYVQWGmugmsAn9A6=XWfY-sDRQ@mail.gmail.com>

I gave this talk at the BES annual meeting on Tuesday:
http://prezi.com/jpr3ltvez2d8/on-the-importance-of-open-science-and-open-data/

(session info: http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/meetings/current_future_meetings/2011_annual_meeting/other_events.php#online
)

I thought it might be worth writing a note on how it went...

Attendance (~interest?) was excellent. Despite there being many
parallel sessions on at the same time, the room was full-to-bursting,
every seat taken with 15+ standing around the edges of the room too.
Relative to attendance at an earlier session:
http://yfrog.com/ki4ughgj I think we did really well in getting this
many people interested in coming. The session organisers (excellent,
btw) had already 'upgraded' our session to a larger room than had been
previously assigned to us, and I think the level of attendance clearly
justified this move.

Despite the level of attendance, there weren't many tweeters. I've
made a storify of the tweets I could find here:
http://storify.com/rmounce/besdigital-workshop-panel-discussion-talks
I noted many of the audience were taking notes with pen & paper... bit
ironic for such a 'digital' session IMO.

Near the start of my talk, I asked how many people (in the audience)
had heard of the Panton Principles: I saw one or two hands raised in
the audience and some from the panel. Now perhaps some people were
shy, but still, I think this shows there's clearly still much to do
wrt to raising awareness in the wider research community. It's better
that they simply aren't aware, rather than aware but wilfully ignoring
the principles I suppose...?

Unfortunately, our talks over-ran quite a bit, so we had less time for
audience/panel discussion than anticipated, and I sense there were
certainly more questions out there in the audience by the time we had
to stop and leave. But overall I'd say it was a resounding success,
and I'm sure they'll repeat such 'digital science' sessions in future
meetings (hopefully in bigger capacity rooms too!).

Props too to the 'next-generation ecologists' (INNGE)
http://innge.net/?q=node/19
They're also promoting open data / data sharing principles in their
subject domain.


Finally, as I discussed with Jenny Molloy at the DryadUK workshop - I
think there's definitely scope for developing a nice pretty / slick /
presentable 'template' version of the Panton Principles for people to
present at other conferences / institutions  / labs  c.f. Mendeley's
promotion strategy. If anyone wants to remix / reuse / rehash my Prezi
please feel free to do so. (Although I'm aware it's perhaps slightly
ironic to use a Prezi as it requires Adobe Flash to be able to present
it...)

Best,

Ross

Not entirely a fair comparison - the online science talks were a lunchtime
workshop, so there were only a couple of other things running in parallel,
while the regular talks had 9 sessions running at the same time.

I chatted to one person about your talk later in the day, but she wasn't
convinced. Essentially, the concern was 'What if we want to get further
analysis & publications from the data?' I know this has come up before, but
as you noted, your message was largely new to this audience. I think the
'Citation' section of the talk was probably the part that resonated most
with the audience.

> I noted many of the audience were taking notes with pen & paper... bit

Pen & paper haven't stopped working. ;-)

Thanks for your talk,
Thomas

I would guess it was more to do with a fear of being scooped - of handing
over the data you may have spent a lot of time collecting to someone who
could beat you to some key analysis and publish the interesting result. But
I should stress that it was an off-hand discussion. I vaguely defended it on
the grounds of reproducibility, but I didn't have any good answer for how
not to get scooped.

Thanks,
Thomas

Cool. Thanks for the feedback.

You're right about the number of parallel sessions; things were more
spread out in the morning, but still I count that the 'digital
science' session was competing/overlapping with at least 4 other
different sessions on offer, namely:

'National Ecosystem Assessment'
'ML & Bayesian workshop'
'Biodiversity and ecosystem services sustainability'
and
'Forest Ecology & REDD'

Given this - I was pretty thrilled to see a packed room.


I'm saddened, but equally not surprised to hear that someone wasn't
convinced on 'Open Data' principles.

The 'What if we want to get further analysis & publications from the
data?' is the classic worry, everyone speaks about, and I understand
why.

The key to this is valuing your data being re-used by someone else
(data citation).
At the moment people see this re-use as bad [scooping], rather than a
good thing [my data was re-used, I got a citation for this re-use, win
for me, win for them, win for science]

For some reason, a lot of academics don't seem to take any pride in
their data being re-used by others. But isn't this the whole point of
science? Science isn't just about generating hypotheses and
conclusions. A large part of science is about generating new data (and
then testing it, re-testing it, adding to it, testing it again,
evaluation...).

The inference I think I draw from your friends' POV is that academics
are only rewarded for producing papers and NOT datasets. I think with
the increasing acceptance of data citation - producing excellent
datasets will be seen on a par with producing excellent papers.

Perhaps next time I shall elaborate more on this during my talk, and
less on the (high) standards of open data one should aspire too.

Many thanks for your comments Thomas.

I think this depends heavily on the nature of the reuse. For meta-analyses
like those you're doing, I expect people wouldn't have a problem with
contributing their dataset, because it's something they're probably not
planning to do themselves. What I think worries people is that someone else
could just pick up their dataset and do the same analyses they want to do.
Also, I think that even people who're happy to share data may feel more
comfortable if re-users have to get in touch with them and request the data,
than if it can just be downloaded freely.

I'd love to see better ways to give credit to people assembling good
datasets (not least because that's what I'm currently trying to do). But I
don't think that's the whole story. Data collection tends to be slow and
tedious, and regardless of the career implications, scientists don't want to
be the one doing the hard graft of collecting data for someone else to do
the relatively interesting work of drawing conclusions. Perhaps ecology is
particularly affected by this - data collection can be particularly slow,
and the statistics are often very complex, which might lead to fears that
someone who knows the stats well will overtake the first researcher on the
analysis.

Well,  if one plans to do further analysis with some data, one should
reserve a time window , say one year? two years? and then do it
To sit on a dataset indefinitely and then after one year, two years
nothing has come out, sounds wrong

What about an option to preserve confidentiality of the data, provided
analysis is published on a quarterly basis. If and when publication of
the results does not occur, the dataset should be opened to others
(nice incentive to publish:-)

Other obvious reasons for people not wanting to share their data. The
first that comes to mind is (pardon the cynicism) their data is
'no good', therefore not presentable. The general public may never
know (and science administrators may have forgotten) how messy things
are in the lab. Or even worse (double forgive pls) The data does not
exist, or it has been completely fabricated. Therefore cannot be
shared. I dont know any reputable scientist, unless they have a patent
in mind, who wouldnt be happy to open the doors to their science,
likewise, I know many fabricators of science who pose as scientists,
who are horrified at the thought of someone looking into their
business


Other considerations
- its the way that science is done (competitively) that makes one
suspicious of opening up their data. Scientific journals compete for
original results, and research funding bodies instigate this
'competition' by means of rewarding 'exclusivity' of scientific
knowledge.  So
if people could get, say, more funding, for making their datasets
available, surely they would do it.

-  a few more rules perhaps? for example, when publishing results, one
must also publish the underlying data upon which the results and
conclusions are drawn, otherwise its not science, but fiction

- when not publishing datasets for everyone to use, one should come up
with further analyses within certain timeframes, not just hoard

- journals take ages, eons, to publish research results. not
necessarily because it takes time to 'check' the data. sometimes is
just red tape and holding back new knowledge. Reputable journals could
publish 'submitted papers' for everyone to see and openly review, then
also publish the 'accepted for publication' ones, based on their own
peer reviews, which would also make the peer review more transparent
and accountable.

Bottom line: its the whole system  that needs to change
not just 'access to knowledge' but also how scientific knowledge is
generated and produced, funded, disseminated, validated, reviewed,
replicated etc

(not expecting personal popularity rating to go up with these
suggestions. just to instill some ideas...)

...probably more.....

I had a meeting with Olive Heffernan, editor of Nature Climate Change.
 Among other things we discussed open science issues.  She asked a
question for which I had no good answer: are there science journalists
in the mainstream media who are covering open science?  The best
answer I had was Charles Arthur (whose name escaped me in a senior
moment).  I know Glyn Moody (who might be on this list too, hi Glyn),
but Glyn's writing really focuses on technology and software rather
than science.  So who else?  Anyone at the big papers? At the BBC?

gamers, but its science section is quite good -- and as for its press
cred, it's owned by Conde Nast.

David Dobbs (Atlantic, Wired &c) is both generally sympathetic and wrote a nice general piece on Open Science a while back (focussing on Jon Eisen). I think there is much more general coverage in the US than in the UK. I would guess we have a relatively limited number of science journalists working professionally in the UK and open science would be a small part of what they are trying to cover.

Cheers

Agreed, and even less in the rest of Europe

As a former London based foreign correspondent for Science and Technology
(1995-2000) I must say that, in my experience, the lack of coverage is
'political', and not due to the lack of journalists willing, or able to
produce coverage. Au contraire,  the classical excuse for lack of coverage
 'we do not have room in the next issue' does not apply to online versions,
yet coverage of critical issues, including science, remains limited.

As as researcher, today I can ask the question 'why'  do we have a limited
number of journalists reporting on science?

Hypotheses welcome :-)

Interesting question. I'd also go with David Dobbs, and the Guardian
journalist who wrote that piece on open science a month or so back was
Bobbie Johnson: http://twitter.com/#!/bobbiejohnson. Feels like Carl Zimmer
and Ed Yong are sympathetic, but have not written specifically on the
subject (?)

I sometimes wonder if open science seems so obvious to those outside science
(i.e. people not actively practising it) that they think the issue doesn't
need pushing. It's only if you're doing science that you see the barriers
and disincentives up close?

Cheers,

Mat

Hi all,

I'm looking for contacts interested in open data / text mining -
particularly related to scholarly publishing, particularly in the UK.

Any suggestions (off list) would be most gratefully received!

All the best,

Jonathan

Public Enterprise"
To: Open Knowledge Foundation discussion list <okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org>


The Royal Society is currently conducting a study to do with openness
within science, Science as a Public Enterprise (SAPE). The society is
requesting participation from interested parties. Submissions are
invited via the completion of a web form:

https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?pli=1&formkey=dGdTbnh2a1NickhkQkdOdjJUbll0MEE6MQ#gid=0

About the study. "[SAPE] aims to identify the principles,
opportunities and problems of sharing and disclosing scientific
information and asks how scientific information should be managed to
support innovative and productive research that reflects public
values."

Here are the questions for reference:

1. What ethical and legal principles should govern access to research
results and data? How can ethics and law assist in simultaneously
protecting and promoting both public and private interests?

2 a) How should principles apply to publicly-funded research conducted
in the public interest?

2 b) How should principles apply to privately-funded research
involving data collected about or from individuals and/or
organisations (e.g. clinical trials)?

2 c) How should principles apply to research that is entirely
privately-funded but with possible public implications?

2 d) How should principles apply to research or communication of data
that involves the promotion of the public interest but which might
have implications from the privacy interests of citizens?

3. What activities are currently under way that could improve the
sharing and communication of scientific information?

4. How do/should new media, including the blogosphere, change how
scientists conduct and communicate their research?

5. What additional challenges are there in making data usable by
scientists in the same field, scientists in other fields, ?citizen
scientists? and the general public?

6 a) What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data for
the productivity and efficiency of scientific research?

6 b) What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data for
new sorts of science?

6 c) What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data for
public policy?

6 d) What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data for
other social benefits?

6 e) What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data for
innovation and economic growth?

6 f) What might be the benefits of more widespread sharing of data for
public trust in the processes of science?

7. How should concerns about privacy, security and intellectual
property be balanced against the proposed benefits of openness?

8. What should be expected and/or required of scientists (in
companies, universities or elsewhere), research funders, regulators,
scientific publishers, research institutions, international
organisations and other bodies?
