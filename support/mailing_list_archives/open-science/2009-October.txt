Message-ID: <54ca21750910130611m3331555fpa7498503194d5121@mail.gmail.com>

For anyone that hasn't seen this:

  http://opendata.si.umich.edu/index.html

Overview:

> Students with research interests in scientific data management, sharing and reuse have a unique opportunity to participate in the Open Data fellowship program. Open Data is an Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) sponsored by NSF. Open Data fellows engage in a vibrant set of research activities at the University of Michigan in the conduct of responsible data-intensive science and engineering involving faculty and doctoral students from SI, Computer Science and Engineering, Bioinformatics, Materials Science, and Chemical Engineering.

> The Open Data fellowships are designed to build a new community of practice around open sharing and reuse of scientific data through inter-disciplinary collaborative research, campus-based seminars and forums, and travel to research conferences.

Anne Fitzgerald and Kylie Pappalardo recently pointed out this book,
which has just been published under a CC-BY-SA license:

"Increasingly, scientific breakthroughs will be powered by advanced
computing capabilities that help researchers manipulate and explore
massive datasets. The speed at which any given scientific discipline
advances will depend on how well its researchers collaborate with one
another, and with technologists, in areas of eScience such as
databases, workflow management, visualization, and cloud computing
technologies."

In particular, there is an article on "The Future of Data Policy" by
Anne Fitzgerald, Brian Fitzgerald and Kylie Pappalardo at, Queensland
University of Technology that might be of interest to list members.

Best wishes,

Subject: [open-science] NIH: Notice on Development of Data Sharing Policy
	for Sequence and Related Genomic Data
Message-ID: <15d850bd0910270840s18dd0d39xaa8dba72e8e9a6ff@mail.gmail.com>

The NIH is updating its data sharing policy:
http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HG-10-006.html

The page seems to be a warning to those seeking NIH support to guess
correctly what the policy will be, but it does invite further contact
to discuss things.

Thanks, Jonathan.  I think the whole book looks interesting.

Open Source Science? Or Distributed Science?
Posted on: October 30, 2009 8:58 AM, by John Wilbanks

I was asked in an interview recently about "open source science" and
it got me thinking about the ways that, in the "open" communities of
practice, we frequently over-simplify the realities of how software
like GNU/Linux actually came to be. Open Source refers to a software
worldview. It's about software development, not a universal truth that
can be easily exported. And it's well worth unpacking the worldview to
understand it, and then to look at the realities of open source
software as they map - or more frequently do not map - to science.
