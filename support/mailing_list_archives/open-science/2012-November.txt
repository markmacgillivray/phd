Message-ID: <CABPM+wpoVvZFvFSvzhTOX0E+_ZCZ1mP=TuKGwjUTXcYRXGrqWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

I've had a request from a grad student via the Oxford Open Science group to
run a hands-on workshop on data/content mining from the scientific
literature, which sounds like an excellent idea.

This would be a physically attended event in Oxford sometime Jan-Mar 2013
(get in touch if you or someone you know might like to be involved in
organising or contributing tools/data/exercises!).

However, as well as providing the resources that are prepared for the
workshop online, I thought that it would be great to use the opportunity to
compile a list of tools and tutorials for those interested in finding out
about content mining, what is technically possible and whether it could
assist their research. Does anyone know of a site like this already in
existence? There is some info on the NaCTem site
http://www.nactem.ac.uk/teaching/ and various resources from individual
courses dotted around the web.

It would be a good tie in to the recent work by the working group on a
Content Mining Manifesto and could be hosted alongside this.

Thoughts on either the workshop or website very welcome!

Jenny

I think this is a really good idea - I'd been thinking about suggesting it
to OKF. People getting into this area spend a lot of time hacking about
with substandard tools and ending up inefficient. I might be in UK end of
Feb onwards and would certainly want to help.

The vital need IMO is to list all the current tools and comment briefly on
them. There are several levels (off the top of my head):
* discovery - where is the content
* scraping - getting it onto your machine (or relevant cloud)
* extracting into "readable" form (e.g. PDF2Foo) - I am blogging about this
* finding tables
* searching for the bits you want (e.g. OSCAR for chemistry)
* linking to known ontologies (e.g. PubChem)
* fiinding somewhere to put the results

and, of course we need to touch on legal aspects and other procedural
matters.

I can contribute chemistry (which although it may not be immediately
relevant to everyone shows many of the aspects and most people know
slightly what it is about - they have heard of molecules and chemical
structures.

Likewise I think the workshop/meeting is a splendid and timely idea.

I've already had a few inquiries about textmining from
*palaeontologists*(and why not?) after I talked about mining in a
recent conference talk in
North Carolina (one of whom is in Oxford actually, John Clarke might well
be interested in this, I've cc'd him into this message).

As John and I were only just discussing earlier today, the scope and
potential for mining techniques is massive and would be useful in so many
different fields. e.g. anyone wanting to do a systematic
(all-literature-encompassing) review on a broad topic

I'll definitely try and be there if I can. I can't do Feb 11th-15th though
(at another conference).

Best,

Ross

Thanks Ross - it was in fact John's suggestion - I should have thought to
cc earlier (sorry John!)

Great, I'll boot up a planning pad. Keep the suggestions coming!

(Wish I could be there).

When the workshop is done, please package up the proceedings and any tools/presentations you demonstrate or develop so they may be reused. I can well imagine conducting one here State-side, for paleo as well as neo folks.

Dear All

You might be interested in an open data campaign being spearheaded by the
British Medical Journal to hold pharmaceutical company Roche accountable
for failing to deliver promised clinical trial data on Tamiflu, a drug
which countries have spent billions of pounds stock piling.

Some of the articles supplied below give a more general overview of the
problem of closed and missing data about clinical research.

More thoughts.

No one else is doing this (coordinating resources), but I feel there is a
large hidden collection of people who want to do content-mining. They need
a community and we are well placed to do this. The objective drivers are:
* introductions to what is technically possible
* overview of protocols
* lists of existing software (crawlers, parsers, semantics, machine
learning...)
* lists of existing online resources (mining sites, name servers,
geotaggers, etc.)
* how to link results

There are some out-of-the-box solutions but many require research and
customisation for each source / domain. It may be necessary to train
Natural Language Processors and Machine Learning. This can strongly benefit
from community - there are many opportunities for annotation and we should
be exploring annottaions tools(including the OKF's).

Also this overlaps with the "lefthand end" of the School of Data and we
should be exchanging information on a regular basis.

For myself I am currently developing a PDF2SVG toolkit (under AMI2). This
has the goal of completely transforming all PDF to a simpler and more
uniform representation. I am blogging this semi-regularly ,
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr. Again there is great scope for involvement
to alpha test and this could be a useful way of people getting into the PDF
area.

It would be nice to have a list of research questions/projects that involve or could benefit from content mining. A heavy-duty example is below, but I am sure there are several research topics that could benefit from commonly available tools and techniques as well as perhaps crowd/community participation.

Here is an example of a content mining project some of my colleagues are working on

I had a request today asking if there was anywhere simple that people could
start reading about content-mining. I think the answer is no. I don't even
think there are good community sites for specialised text-mining and
data-mining. So this makes it even more important to create some.

The important thing to realise is that many aspects are not deeply
technical. A lot requires us to collate fragmented knowledge. Here's one
where I would welcome input from anyone.

 So one of our first tasks in building AMI2 (intelligent reader of STM
literature) is to find a recent paper from each publisher that is "Open
Access" - i.e. labelled in some way as Open. Anyone can help in this. This
will give us a corpus of papers that we can develop and test on.In that way
we can develop a per-publisher technology. That's probably about 100. Then
we summarize the information. It would be useful to have something like:

Publisher name:
Provides HTML?
HTML figure format (PNG, JPG, etc...)
HTML table format (PNG, HTML, XL, CSV ...)
HTML References
HTML Bibliographic Metadata

BIBTEX metadata

PDF?
PDF fonts used (this will come out of AMI)
PDF non-Unicode fonts (this will come out of AMI)
PDF has Vector Graphics (also out of AMI)

How are math equations provided (GIF, TeX, MathematicalPI, ...)

Supplemental data?
Supp outside firewall?
Supp data formats (CIF, XL, Word, etc)

Licence and or restriction for Open publications

Crawling URLs and strategy (i.e. how do we find papers).

If we summarize this it makes it much easier for anyone wanting to find
information in a lot of journals. For example if we are looking for
geological terms we may want to crawl Nature, Science, Amer. Mineral, etc.
It's very useful if people have done the exploration and listed it. already

Pro-iBiosphere is a European Union  FP7 funded project to develop an outline of a future European open biodiversity knowledge management system. The Pro-iBiosphere project has been launched on September 1, 2012 for the period of 2 years addressing technical and semantic interoperability issues and challenges that will ultimately lead to a more efficient system of the management of biodiversity information.  For practical reasons and to demonstrate the functionality of the proposed ideas, the test beds are primarily the production of floras and faunas produced at the partner's institutions, how they can be linked to external datasets, and how the new information can be made more widely accessible. 

A series of open workshops will be help to discuss, challenge and improve the specific tasks in the envisioned system. Pilot studies will play a pivotal role in demonstrating the advantages, as well as the gaps in current technology, legal aspects and the sociology of the proposed system.

 

Consortium partners are the Naturalis Leiden, the Royal Botanical Garden Kew, the National Botanic Garden Belgium,  the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem, Sigma Orionis, Pensoft and Plazi.

Dear All

As we have grown to over 400 people on the mailing list and activities have
expanded it would be great to form a committee with a few more people on
board to make sure the working group is as effective as possible in
achieving our mission of opening up science and scientific research outputs.

If you'd be interested in getting more involved in running the group and
our activities and projects, get in touch!
It would also be great to have representatives in local areas willing to
act as open science champions in their own countries or cities.

The types of roles we'd like to fill are below, as well as a reminder of
some of the projects we've got on the go. The time commitment will be
flexible and relatively low, but it will make a big difference to have
someone keeping an eye on specific areas! If you know anyone not on the
list who might be interested in getting involved, please forward this
message to them.

Thanks for your responses everyone, I think it's clear we've identified a
need.
I'm in the process of planning the next Open Science Hackday and I think it
would be good to focus on content mining to try and get some of these
resources off the ground, particularly as there are non-technical aspects
to which many people can contribute. So in terms of next steps:

1) Organise content mining themed open science hackday, to include a sprint
on content for community sites [early Dec]

Topics for inclusion:
* introductions to what is technically possible
* overview of protocols
* lists of existing software (crawlers, parsers, semantics, machine
learning...)
* lists of existing online resources (mining sites, name servers,
geotaggers, etc.)
* how to link results
* a list of research questions/projects that involve or could benefit from
content mining

2) Crowdsource AMI2 development corpus - please contribute!
(Peter - I've copied your fields into a googledoc with the publishers from
Ross' open access spreadsheet)

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtV3tIqIu0UZdFI5U3hRZVl0S05ZM0hNS3NYYTdFYnc

3) Organise content mining workshop and make content available online
[planning from Jan, run Mar/Apr]

I hope this sounds good, I'll let you know as soon as I've sorted a date
for the hackday and start booting up some documents for people to
contribute to remotely or in their own time.

Jenny

Hi Jenny,

May I suggest that you run such an inquiry in DebateGraph [1] rather
than email? It's a structured conversation mechanism for organizing
facts, opinions, links, and so forth. People can subscribe to get
emails of changes to the conversation.

Where can I find a description of AMI2 (bigger than the parenthetical
expression above)?  Has it got a project page?  A Github repo? A search of
the OKFN site gives one hit implying that it's a "large software framework"
but otherwise offers no clues.

I may have said this before, but I find it dizzying trying to keep up with
the stream of projects & TLAs that OKFN creates, renames and abandons.
 It'd be great to have a page on the web site which lists all the projects,
their current names, their previous names, what they're about, etc.

I strongly support this , Jenny.
(For those who don't realise it Jenny has put a HUGE amolunt of work into
this).

There must be post of people out there who hace skills that can be
contributed. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A SCIENTIST. Much of the needed work is
gathering resources and making them available on the web. A good
Sunday-afternoon/evening activity!

I am absolutely sure that any resource in this area will be highly valued.
Your effort will be valuable and recognised.

Dear Jenny and Others,

After a long time gap I am sending a (reply) mail to this Open Science. I
would like to get associated and would love to work on the following:-

- Open Research Data Handbook

- Open Access Index (@ccess and Open Bibliography)

- Who Needs Access? (@ccess)

And I would like to join with others who are working for the Access to
Materials (Biological like Plants/Seeds - onlines of Open Source
Software/Creative Commons Licensing)

Thanks & Regards
Sridhar

Dear all,

*Registration for OpenAIRE?s conference closes next Sunday, 11 November. 
*Participation is free but seats are limited.

To register please visit: http://www.openaire.eu/en/conference2012

*OpenAIRE Conference "Enlightenment in the Knowledge Society"*

Date: 21-22 November 2012
Location: G?ttingen State and University Library, G?ttingen, Germany
Hashtag:#openaire12
Follow us:www.twitter.com/OpenAIRE_eu <http://www.twitter.com/OpenAIRE_eu>

The conference will present the results of the OpenAIRE project which 
supports the European Commission?s Seventh Framework Open Access 
Pilot.^It will feature a picture of the open access & supporting 
infrastructure landscape in Europe and offer views ranging from 
researcher?s views on scientific information, to the role of data 
infrastructures, research institutions and funders. This will offer a 
fitting context to Horizon 2020, where open access will be a general 
principle for all European researchprogrammes. The programme will also 
give insight into the OpenAIREplus proje ct, which will link 
publications to research data, enabling seamless access to scientific 
knowledge.

The agenda includes:

?Introduction to OpenAIRE?s Achievements and Challenges

?Services on Top of Repositories ? Enhancing the User Experience

?Policies and Practices on Data and Publications ? A Legal Perspective

?International Collaboration on Research Data Infrastructure (iCORDI) & 
Research Data Alliance

?Panel Discussion on Opening Access to Publications & Data ? Making the 
Vision Reality

The meeting is organized by OpenAIRE and OpenAIREplus, with the support 
of the Directorate Generals for Communications Networks, Content and 
Technology(CONNECT) and Research and Innovation (RTD). Invitees are 
decision makers and other stakeholders in research from all EU Member 
States and further Associated countries. The event is co-hosted by 
G?ttingen University, founded in 1734 during the Enlightenment. 
G?ttingen?s spirit of learning has been transferred to the 21^st century 
by the promotion of open access successfully both in Europe and 
internationally. The Conference will send an appropriate signal to the 
European community at a time when the Commission?s Communication & 
Recommendation on Scientific Information are being discussed in European 
member states.

We look forward to see you in G?ttingen!

On behalf of the OpenAIRE team,
Birgit Schmidt, OpenAIRE Scientific Manager

Hi All

OpenAIRE are looking for short video statements on open science by 14 Nov
to play at OpenAIRE Conference 2012 (hopefully they'll also make them
publicly available under an open license so we can play them at other open
science events)

If we make them we can set our own licence - I iamgine you mean the ones
they make and the collection. Yes, we should press for this.

Will,

Just to confirm I just merged in Katie's edits, and pushed them to the
git repository. Mainly spelling/grammar fixes. Look forward to seeing
your changes.

This looks interesting.

The Denton Declaration calls itself "An Open Data Manifesto" - but suspect
it is more of "An Accessible Data Manifesto" (there is no explicit mention
of data licensing, legal status or reusability).

http://openaccess.unt.edu/denton_declaration

Has anyone been in touch with them?

Subject: [open-science] is open access for rich countries? invitation to a
	discussion
Message-ID: <50AE1609.3020801@ajantriks.net>

Participate now in an online dialogue on open access and the developing 
world

You are invited to take part in an online discussion on Open Access (OA) 
from the perspective of the developing world.

Funded by DFID, through the Mobilising Knowledge for Development (MK4D) 
programme in the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, 
and managed through the African Commons project in South Africa and the 
Centre for Internet and Society in India, the discussion will be hosted 
on UNESCO?s WSIS Open Access Community Forum. This open access dialogue 
will provide a valuable space to discuss different perspectives on what 
open access means for the developing world and what it can offer.

There is compelling evidence which indicates that OA has finally entered 
mainstream discourse. Yet, in the developing world context there remain 
specific challenges and untapped opportunities for OA. A series of open 
access discussions aimed at developing world critical thinkers, 
activists and academics, seeks to explore insights and articulate 
opinion on OA in the developing world.  Join us for stimulating debate!

Register here: 
http://institutefordevelopmentstudies.createsend1.com/t/r-l-kuxltt-jluthukldd-j/

Setting the context

Open access has enjoyed a great deal of acceptance and growth over the 
last decade, with a particularly strong spurt in the adoption of open 
access policies by major agencies and governments in the last 12 months. 
With open access policies and initiatives now being taken up by UNESCO, 
the World Bank, the FAO, the European Commission, and the governments of 
the United Kingdom and the United States, among others, it is clear that 
open access has entered the global mainstream. These policies stress the 
human rights potential of open access in providing access to scientific 
and cultural knowledge, ensuring its impact and ensuring public access 
to publicly funded research.

We now know that open access can work in the immediate and short term in 
providing better access to the research literature, whilst some of the 
longer term consequences and effects are still emerging. This is 
especially so in the developing world, which has been badly served by 
the publishing system we have inherited from the 20th century, which has 
marginalized research from developing countries. New opportunities and 
possibilities are created by open access, and, at the same time certain 
pitfalls need to be noted and avoided.

A foundational report prepared to inform this dialogue shows the risks 
posed to all scholarly communications, discourse and practices by the 
publish-or-perish system, and indicates that in the developing world, 
the detriments are potentially much deeper and more damaging.  As 
researchers are incentivised to publish in overseas-based journals - 
mostly unavailable in many developing world contexts - this research 
?brain-drain? risks widening the gap between research and policy [1].

Read more here

Get discussing!

The first debate will kick off on Tuesday, 27 November 2012.

A general topic will be complemented by two sub discussions.  The 
discussion will be hosted on the WSIS Knowledge Platform's Open Access 
group. To take part you will be required to register on the platform.

KEY TOPIC: Production, publication and consumption of scholarly 
knowledge and OA.

This will focus on the greater concern of scholarly research in the 
developing country context debating the questions: What does OA imply 
and offer the developing world in terms of production, publication and 
consumption of academic materials and research activities? What are the 
specific challenges and opportunities for access to knowledge in 
developing countries?

Within this topic the following sub-themes will be introduced:

Sub-theme 1: Considering the issues of 'translation' of research for 
development impact; co-production and increasing access to academic 
materials; and the importance of OA in producing and sharing of 
non-state-supported educational materials; and

Sub-theme 2: OA in academia and the search for global prestige; the 
perverse impact of metrics and rankings; scholarly knowledge production; 
and sharing and consumption challenges in developing countries.

We will keep you posted about the second debate which will take place 
early in January 2013.

In the meantime you are also encouraged to tweet about the discussions 
using hashtag #developoa or follow the debates on Facebook here

Subject: [open-science] Crowdcrafting.org powered by PyBossa
Message-ID: <CAGS_vfoeennoOMeohhRqGGWMVep+ty4xeEEh=B_4ZPvtPoYW7g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

In the last weeks we have been really busy working on PyBossa and our new
web site crowdcrafting.org.

As most of you already know, PyBossa is a joint effort between the Open
Knowledge Foundation and Citizen Cyberscience
Centre<http://citizencyberscience.net>,
so we have been in two scientific applications using
PyBossa<http://dev.pybossa.com>
.

We would like to share with you the *latest news* *about the projects* that
we have now up and running and that *you may be interested* in *participating
as volunteers* (an extra hand is always welcome!), *giving feedback* (we
want to know what we are doing wrong), and if you like the platform and you
have a project or idea that could use PyBossa *asking questions about how
you can use PyBossa <http://dev.pybossa.com>* :-)

Currently we have been working in two scientific projects:

   - *ForestWatchers.net:* the goal of this project is to build a global
   network of volunteers to monitor forests across the world with limited
   means of self monitoring using a web application.
   - *Feynman's Flowers <http://crowdcrafting.org/app/feynmanflowers>:  *this
   CrowdCrafting.org application is using PyBossa to extract new information
   about the subtle ways that molecules (at nano scale level) interact with
   the surfaces they are stuck to, and how this affects their magnetic
   properties.

Those applications are using the *basic template apps* that we have created
to help new users and developers to create their own applications for the
PyBossa platform (you could deploy it in your own server or if you prefer
use crowdcrafting.org <http://CrowdCrafting.org>):

   - *Flickr Person Finder <http://crowdcrafting.org/app/flickrperson>*: a
   simple pattern recognition image application. You can use it for
   classifying objects or features within pictures, figures, photos, etc.
   (this template was used to bootstrap Feynman's Flowers).
   - *Urban Parks* <http://crowdcrafting.org/app/urbanpark>: a geo-coding
   app template where you need to use web mapping tools to solve a problem
   (this template was used as a starting point for ForestWatchers.net)
   - *PDF Transcribe* <http://crowdcrafting.org/app/pdftranscribe>: a PDF
   transcription template that could be used for transcribing full PDF
   documents one page at a time including scanned images.

We have also launched a new developers site for PyBossa called:

http://dev.pybossa.com

where we will be posting as soon as possible more information about
projects that are using PyBossa, better documentation, specific tutorials,
etc.

For the moment we have one
tutorial<http://docs.pybossa.com/en/latest/user/create-application-tutorial.html>and
a full documentation site:

http://docs.pybossa.com

If you need any help with the framework or you want to know a bit more
about it, do not hesitate and send me directly an e-mail. We can arrange a
Skype or G+ Hangouts meeting if you prefer to talk instead of type :D

Best regards,

Daniel

Subject: [open-science] Pybossa 101 Online Course
Message-ID: <CAGALA3SvEU9Y4==Neen=r_W4UWKv20AkwQ=joQXzDz6MXdcfzA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

recently, the Pybossa team has been working very hard which has led to
Crowdcrafting.org, a free, open-source crowd-sourcing and micro-tasking
platform. It enables people to create and run projects that utilise online
assistance in performing tasks that require human cognition such as image
classification, transcription, geocoding and more. Today I have published a
blog on OpenGLAM about PDF transcription:
http://openglam.org/2012/11/28/using-pybossa-for-transcribing-cultural-works/

It is a very easy tool to create your own application, but getting started
can be a bit tricky. Therefore I am very excited that Daniel Lombrana
Gonzales of the Citizen Cyberscience Center has kindly offered to give a
lecture via Google Hangout. We will start here with the absolute basics of
installing Pybossa on your machine and creating a first simple app. We will
start in the afternoon and work for 2-3 hours.

I have set up a Doodle to find a good timeslot in the coming weeks for
this. If you want to join, please indicate your availability.

http://doodle.com/ewt478fpbsmienhn#table

Hope that some of you can join and that we can see the first apps appearing
soon!

All the best,

Hi there,

Thanks for announcing this idea Joris and for contacting so many people :-)
Few quick notes:

1.- Google Hangouts+ only handles 9 people at the same time, so how do we
do if we end up more than 9? IRC?
2.- Zach, I already created some materials to learn PyBossa in P2PU.org:
what about if I update the course? [1]

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi All

This may be of interest to you or your contacts!

Jenny

** **

*Open PhD Competition in Extreme Citizen Science*

* *

*Duration* ? 3 years****

* *

*Funding* The scholarship covers UCL tuition fees and provides a stipend of
?15,590 per annum tax free. Travel expenses and research equipment will be
provided to the successful candidate****

* *

*Funding Body* EPSRC****

* *

*Vacancy Information*****

This is an open call for a prospective PhD student to propose a novel and
exciting project to develop new methods in Extreme Citizen Science, or
which addresses a particularly interesting or unusual problem.****

The Extreme Citizen Science (ExCiteS) group at UCL is a collaborative and
interdisciplinary research team, with the vision to challenge the way we do
traditional science and engineering. While existing Citizen Science
practices assume that educated citizens can participate in scientific data
collection, but not in formulating research questions and/or in the
analysis of results, we believe that the greatest future impacts of science
are likely to be gained when almost everyone is empowered to participate in
research and use scientific tools to improve their environment locally and
share the knowledge globally.****

Extreme Citizen Science is essentially science by citizens, where people
take real ownership of the issues that concern them. Regardless of their
level of literacy or education people can collect scientifically valid data
to evidence, illustrate and frame the issue, then visualise and analyse the
results to subsequently develop strategies in order to address it. Our team
is working together to develop tools and methodologies that facilitate this
process in which anyone (from individuals to groups and communities) can
start their own scientific investigation. ExCiteS tools are developed and
expanded directly with people in their communities allowing for co-created
knowledge to be shared and used in a process of empowerment and action. In
a technical sense, in ExCiteS we engage in a process of creating new
languages which we technologically facilitate and which enable communities
that are not in conversation to engage in a conversation, which has results
and changes what is happening in that particular context ? whether it is
the airplanes flying over Isleworth or the activities of Eco-guards in
Congo.****

To find more about us you can visit our website
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/excites/ , read our blog
http://uclexcites.wordpress.com/category/articles/  and look at
presentations by our directors, Muki Haklay (see
https://povesham.wordpress.com/tag/citizen-science/  ) and Jerome Lewis (
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXPfryZxUs0 ).****

** **

*Studentship Description*****

** **

We are looking for applicants who have research proposals that fall within
and complement our aims and objectives. You should be able to provide a
clear research idea that will contribute to or extend ExCiteS activities,
but which will be theoretically sophisticated and methodologically novel.
Your research proposal needs to explain what your contribution will be, the
methods that you will use, an estimation of further support (beyond the
studentship) that you will need to complete your studies, a timeline of key
activities and also show how your work could complement our vision and
other activities of the group.****

* *

*Person Specification*****

** **

Applicants should possess an honours degree (1st Class or 2:1 minimum), and
a Masters degree in any discipline that contributes to the development of
ExCiteS methods and theories. Currently the ExCiteS group consists of
several PhD students and researchers from a multiplicity of backgrounds and
skills: artists, planners, anthropologists, computer scientists, and
geographers with knowledge in community development, electronic
engineering, and conservation. Your application will not be limited to a
specific discipline. Non-academic experience that relates to or contributes
to your research is an asset but not a requirement. You will also need to
demonstrate experience in project management and demonstrate that you can
set yourself long term goals and achieve them, and be able to work with the
diverse, multidisciplinary group that ExCiteS is. Language skills beyond
English are desirable.****

* *

*Eligibility*****

** **

Applications are invited from UK and EU citizenship holders. Unfortunately,
we will not be able to cover the difference in tuition fee costs for people
from outside the EU, though you are welcome to apply if you are non-EU if
you can self-fund the difference in tuition fees.****

* *

*Start Date*****

** **

The PhD studies will commence between February 2013 and October 2013, at
time that is suitable to the candidate.****

* *

*Application Procedure*****

** **

Applicants should send a cover letter, 4 pages research proposal, examples
of academic writing (e.g. Masters dissertation), outputs from past work, 2
reference letters and CV to Gail Austen-Price (g.austen-price at ucl.ac.uk ).
The cover letter should include a personal statement explaining your
interest in citizen science, why you are interested in our project and how
you would see your work integrated into ExCiteS vision and activities. You
are welcome to contact Gail, Muki, Jerome and other members of the group
with queries about your research proposal or if you would like to have an
informal call about it.****

* *

*Closing Date*****

** **

26 January 2013****

Subject: [open-science] Launching the Open Sustainability Working Group
Message-ID: <CAChagOA6fx31GRUJBU6VnKG8TH1KeOo3y4QB576K3EH7+V=0eA@mail.gmail.com>

*Dear all,*

We would like to announce the launching of the Open Sustainability Working
Group<http://blog.okfn.org/2012/11/30/launching-open-sustainability-working-group/>of
the Open Knowledge Foundation and invite you to join the Open
Sustainability Mailing
list<http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-sustainability>.


...

*Sustainability is one of the most important challenges of our time. We are
facing global environmental crises, such as climate change, resource
depletion, deforestation, overfishing, eutrophication, loss of
biodiversity, soil degradation, environmental pollution, etc. We need to
move towards a more sustainable and resilient society, that ensures the
well-being of current and future generations, that allows us to progress
while stewarding the finite resources and the ecosystems we depend on. *

*Data is needed to monitor the condition of the environment and to measure
how we are performing and progressing (or not) towards sustainability.
Transparency and feedback is key for good decision-making, for allowing
accountability and for tracking and tuning performance. This is true both
at an institutional level, such as working with national climate change
goals; at a company level, such as deciding the materials for building a
product; and at a personal level, deciding between chicken and salmon at
the supermarket. However, most of the environmental information is closed,
outdated, static, or/and in text documents that are not possible to process.

*

*For instance, unlike gross domestic product (GDP) and other publicly
available data, carbon dioxide emissions data is not published frequently
and in disaggregated form. While the current international climate
negotiations at Doha
<http://unfccc.int/meetings/doha_nov_2012/meeting/6815.php>discuss joint
global efforts for the reduction of greenhouse gas emission, climate data
is not freely and widely available. *
*

?Demand CO2 data!<http://blog.okfn.org/2012/09/21/demand-carbon-dioxide-data-says-hans-rosling-to-open-data-advocates-at-okfestival/>?
urged Hans Rosling at the Open Knowledge Festival in Helsinki last
September, encouraging a data-driven discussion of energy and resources.
?We can have climate change beyond our expectations, which we haven?t done
anything in time for? said Rosling in outlining the biggest challenges of
our time. Activists don?t even demand the data. Many countries, such as
Sweden, show up for climate negotiations without having done their CO2
emissions reporting for many months. Our countries should report on climate
data in order for us to see the big picture.

Sustainability data should be open and freely available so anyone is free
to use, reuse, and redistribute it. This data should be easy to access,
both usable for the public but also accessible in standard machine-readable
formats for enabling reuse and remix. And by sustainability data we do not
mean only CO2 information, but all data that is necessary for measuring the
state of, and changes in, the environment, and data which supports progress
towards sustainability.  This include a diversity of things like:
scientific climate data and temperature records, environmental impact
assessment of products and services, emissions and pollution information
from companies and governments, energy production data or ecosystem health
indicators.

To move towards this goal, we are founding a new Working Group on Open
Sustainability, which seeks to:


   - advocate and promote the opening up of sustainability information and
   datasets
   - collect sustainability information and maintain a knowledge base of
   datasets
   - act as a support environment / hub for the development of
   community-driven projects
   - provide a neutral platform for working towards standards and
   harmonization of open sustainability data between different groups and
   projects.


The Open Sustainability Working Group is open for anyone to join.  We hope
to form an interdisciplinary network from a range of backgrounds such as
academics, business people, civil servants, technologists, campaigners,
consultants and those from NGOs and international institutions.  Relevant
areas of expertise include sustainability, industrial ecology, climate and
environmental science, cleanweb development, ecological economics, social
science, sustainability, energy, open data and transparency.  Join the Open
Sustainability Working Group by signing up to the mailing
list<http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/open-sustainability>to
share your ideas and to contribute.

Creating a more sustainable society and mitigating climate change are some
of the very hardest challenges we face.  It will require us to collaborate,
to create new knowledge together and new ways of doing things. We need open
data about the state of the planet, we need transparency about emissions
and the impact of products and industries, we need feedback and we need
accountability. We want to leverage all the ideas, technologies and energy
we can to prevent catastrophic environmental change.

This initiative was started by the OKFestival Open Knowledge and
Sustainability and Green
Hackathon<http://openeconomics.net/2012/10/06/okfestival-sustainability-stream-recap/>team
including Jorge Zapico, Hannes Ebner (The Centre for Sustainable
Communications at KTH), James Smith (Cleanweb UK), Chris Adams (AMEE), Jack
Townsend (Southampton University) and Velichka Dimitrova (Open Knowledge
Foundation).*
