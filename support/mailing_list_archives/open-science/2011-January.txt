Dear All,

I've started a question on Quora to discuss the topic of whether scientific
texts (rather than data) should be put into the public domain rather than
licensed under CC-BY, as it seems an important issue which hasn't been
extensively discussed. The discussion is at
http://www.quora.com/Should-scientific-writing-be-put-into-the-public-domain -
I'd be grateful for any thoughts, particularly from people with legal
backgrounds.

Best wishes,
Marius

Dear Marius,

Good point. However, legally speaking, there are jurisdictions where
authors cannot waive all rights or put a work in the public domain,
mainly continental european jurisdictions. In fact, there are some
rights, called moral rights, that last forever. Among those rights
there is the right of attribution.

Best,

Ignasi

Hi Graham, hi all,

> Just a wee (further) reminder re. tomorrow's discussion.

good idea :-)

recently added the following possible topics:

2) how keep track of emerging thematic overlaps between PPs? (which may actually be useful) - how build a network among the PPs as we go along and publish them (make a concept?)

3) ? start a list of "best practise" sites/people with short summaries on "why best" - keep updated

4) ? create a common pool of PP references in bibtex (which we intend to use in our PPs)

see you later, cheers,
Claudia

I'd be very pleased to present some of this at our symposium
http://www-pmr.ch.cam.ac.uk/wiki/Main_Page - if we can have a page about PP
then we can include that in our distributed material.

Jenny - were you going to come on Monday - we'd love to see you and there's
several people that you should meet. If so please mail smb28 at cam.ac.uk

The ccZero waiver (and I think PDDL?) try to cover this by saying firstly
that you give up any rights that you have, and that you are able to give up
and you commit to not pursuing legal redress for any rights that you can't
give up. As was pointed out to me you can't in a legal sense actually "put
something into the Public Domain", it either is or it isn't. What you're
doing with PDDL/CC0 is making something interoperable with the public
domain. It's usually not a terribly important distinction but there are ways
in which you can get tripped up at least in theory.

Peter Murray-Rust sent me this message, which has an interesting point that
I had not considered - that licenses serve mainly to incentivize publishing
organizations to share science in an acceptable way. I think this
is debatable however; Green Open Access may rise, for example, as well
online self-publishing, blogs, etc. Moreover, CC0 brings so much clarity to
the scientific re-use process at so little cost (a blurb and a link) that it
seems a shame not to use it.

I tried to post an answer to the blog but couldn't - feel free to add it:

=========
+1 for promoting CC-BY. There are two cases:
* the community functions (or wishes to function) as a community. Many
subdisciplines work like this. Norms are far more important than legal
contracts (which is what CC is). Breaking norms can lead to public
criticism, termination of funding and more.
* the community is dysfunctional and purely competitive (there are many of
these). They won't be bothered by CC-anything - they won't do it.
CC-* is a legal contract whose main current function is to require third
parties (mainly primary and secondary publishers) to honour the wishes of
the authors. It is regrettable that we even have to do this - it's because
many publishers are working for their own self interest anjd not the
community. Publishers, being leagl entiaties, cannot afford to openly break
the law. CC-* is a blunt, but not completely ineffective instrument to
prevent the digital gold rush.
In short - do not use CC-* to try to influence the behaviour of other
scientists. It wasn't designed for that

The other point that I feel is worth making is that many of the reasons that
the Panton Principles and Open Biblio give for using the public domain apply
equally to scientific texts - why should open scientists advocate a
confusing two-tiered system of public domain for data and bibliographic
records but copyright licensing for papers and books?

No, my point was that a licence could stop a publisher from appropriating
and restricting work that was not their own. I don't think it acts as any
incentive. Licences may gently help to change academic culture if people see
enough of them - but there are other ways of spreding the word.

I'm having trouble seeing the advantage of CC0 over CC-BY for writing. For
data, a few dozen lines of code can pull in data from a large number of
sources, potentially making it tricky to keep track of all the attributions.
Writing is generally done by humans, so it's hardly onerous to point to
sources.

The scientific search engine example you give (on Quora) would most likely
be exempt under 'fair use' or equivalent provisions, and in any case, I
would consider the links it provides to be attribution. After all, Google
provides 'snippets' of all-rights-reserved works without much trouble. Even
if we can produce software intelligent enough to read free text, and
synthesise interesting summaries from it, we'll undoubtedly want links to
the originals (would automatic summaries actually infringe copyright?).

What could we do if all scientific writing was CC0, that couldn't be done if
it was all CC-BY?

1) You said it yourself - "a few dozen lines of code can pull in data from a
large number of source, potentially making it tricky to keep track of all
the attributions". One day not very far from today, scientific texts will be
the raw data of natural language science knowledge engines, and then the
situation for text will be exactly the same as that for data. Using CC0
today will make this easier in the future, for all the same reasons that you
support CC0 for data.

2) Using CC0 simplifies the science IP landscape; it would allow us to tell
unconverted scientists to simply use the public domain for all works, rather
than a hodgepodge of CC0 for data, CC-BY for PLoS One, CC-BY-NC for Nature's
Scientific Reports, etc etc. Much simpler to say: publicly funded science
belongs in the public domain.

Best,
Marius

A footnote: Google did not provide snippets of copyrighted books "without
much trouble" - they fought a long, protracted legal battle that cost them
more than $100 million (

It may be worth posting on this to the JISC repositories list. The 
argument I've seen put forward by open access advocates there is that 
authors should retain copyright rather than comply with publisher 
requests to hand it over. Even if they could legally give up their moral 
right, are you saying it is in the public interest for researchers to 
give up their right to be attributed?

hm, this holds true for legal traditions in countries that have a copyright law similar to the UK or the USA
in the legal traditions of continental Europe, authors will always keep their moral right (unless they publish anonymously) - as far as I know, this is certainly also an issue to be addressed in the Panton Papers: legal traditons may be different and we can possible gain some interesting ideas for, e.g., Open Data, from each if these traditions :-)

Thanks for all the feedback. A few points:

Lance: I think the issue is to settle what the correct legal distribution
mechanism is for 'normal' or 'baseline' science; that is, studies which are
wholly publicly funded and do not involve sensitive data or data with
ethical ramifications. For these studies, I think the consensus is that all
of the restrictions except for the first, 'Attribution', depicted in your
diagram are inappropriate (at least for taxpayers of the country that funded
the research). There also seems to be consensus that for data generated from
these studies, Attribution should not be compelled legally (cf. the Panton
Principles). What I am proposing is that the texts describing the studies
themselves - ie. papers, articles - be treated the same way. Attribution can
and should still be compelled through traditional means - community
standards and norms, with censure, loss of tenure, etc, for offenders - as
Puneet pointed out, but, I suggest, not legally.

Angus and Claudia: According to Wikipedia, moral rights are not necessarily
always assigned; in various countries authors can agree not to enforce them
(some European countries) or waive them (Canada), and in some countries they
are not assigned unless the author 'asserts' them (eg. the UK) (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights_(copyright_law).

Angus: Yes, I am suggesting that it would be in the public interest for
researchers to give up their legal rights to attribution. The arguments are
set out in the Quora page, but they boil down to the fact that researchers
don't use those rights today (cf. the lack of copyright infringement
lawsuits by open science academics), that publicly funded science should be
a public 'good' subject to no restrictions, and that it would help with
future technical challenges in knowledge processing.

Puneer: I agree with almost everything you say, but I think it would be
optimal for the open science community to advocate one legal tool, rather
than many, both for interoperability and for simplicity in disseminating
open science practices. If the community chooses the public domain, I would
envision a website, say www.publicscience.org, that gave a rationale and
easy-to-follow instructions (eg. use CC0 on everything you do) for would-be
open scientists, similar to the Panton Principles but for all products of
scientific research (papers, code, etc) rather than just data.

Angus: I will post it on the JISC repositories list; thanks for the
suggestion. I'm interested to hear what they say.

Best wishes,
Marius

Copyright on writing protects an arrangement of words. If this hypothetical
knowledge engine reuses enough of that arrangement in some response to
potentially infringe copyright, there's no reason it can't include a link to
their source (attribution), and I would want it to. What use would it be
without pointing to its sources? If it doesn't reuse that arrangement of
words, it can't infringe the writer's copyright. I can't see a situation in
which you'd want to copy text verbatim without referring to the source.

I don't think "CC-BY for writing, CC0 for data" is too complex.

Google did get in trouble over the books, but the snippets in their web
search, from copyrighted web pages and PDFs are generally uncontroversial.

Puneet:
> What could we do if all scientific writing were CC-BY that couldn't be
done if it were all CC0?

To play devil's advocate: sue anyone who distributes it without attribution.
To put it plainly, CC0 potentially leads to:
- Some unwanted potential outcomes (people are free to rip your work off
without giving you any credit)
- Possibly some desirable outcomes, but I've not yet heard any ideas that I
agree would be obstructed by CC-BY.

I'm willing to be convinced, but I don't yet see the upside that not
requiring attribution for writing would bring.

I don't have especially strong feelings about this, but a few 
observations:

(1) Attribution amongst scientists is currently enforced normatively, not 
legally.  Those norms aren't perfect, but they are very, very strong: as a 
scientist one of the worst accusations that can be made against you is one 
of plagiarism.

The implication is that it's perfectly possible to (normatively) require 
attribution, but to release things into the public domain, where 
attribution is not legally required.

My understanding is that a large number of written scientific works from 
the US Government are already released into the public domain.  Yet this 
hasn't caused an outbreak of people copying them without attribution.  So 
I think it's a mistake to think that adopting CC0 means not requiring 
attribution.  It merely means not LEGALLY requiring attribution, which is 
quite different.

(2) I can easily imagine a future in which a thousand-word piece of text 
has (a) tens or hundreds of thousands of authors; and (b) goes through 
hundreds or even thousands of public iterations, possibly involving many 
quite different sets of authors.  I don't know of a case where both these 
things have already happened, but point (a) has arguably already happened 
in the case of Galaxy Zoo and Foldit, where tens or hundreds of thousands 
of people contributed to the analysis.  And point (b) is seen in projects 
such as the Matlab programming competition.  I like a term I've heard John 
Wilbanks use to describe the problem with attribution that arises in this 
kind of situation: it creates an attribution stacking problem. (I've heard 
John mostly use it for data, and don't intend to imply that he agrees with 
what I'm saying here.)  Personally, I'd be in favour of developing tools 
to handle the attribution stacking problem in these kinds of situations. 
But I am a bit uncomfortable with the notion of legally requiring 
attribution.  What happens as the community fragments?  Maybe some authors 
will disagree with later versions of "their" paper, and want to rescind 
authorship?  Or they'll agree with only parts of the paper?  Perhaps 
managing authorship legally in such a complex environment will turn out to 
be more trouble than it's worth, and it would be better instead to focus 
on coming up with flexible normative solutions.

This is really exciting and I'd like to encapsulate some of this for
potential discussion on Monday.

I agree with what Marius says. For me CC-* is not as powerful as community
norms. The very fact of CC-* is that it has been published and the act of
making public is more powerful than legal mechanisms.

If I publish an idea in a paper and someone else rapidly does the
experiment  then the mores of that are giverned by community norms not the
llicence (it may be good or it may be bad). If a referee reads a manuscript
and then does the experiment that isn't protected by law but it's rightly
castigated by the community (though often undetected). CC-* ONLY protects
against lifting text and that is very easy to detect and can be dealt with
by better means.

Note that giving up one's legal right to be attributed [*] is not the 
same as giving up the right to be attributed, according to the norms of 
the relevant community.

[*] In fact, I'm not at all sure researchers currently have a legal right 
to attribution.  Anyone know?

<furious applause>

We've gotten far too used to equating freedoms with public licenses. 
Public licenses scale in their adoption to the extent they are in line 
with the norms of the communities that adopt them. It's one of the 
reasons those licenses are so hard to integrate into business cultures 
with closed norms - not because of legal complexity, but because they 
violate the norms of enclosed communities.

Sort of. Collections of US gov't works are regularly sold to collections 
outside the US, and getting unambiguous marking of PD works as such 
without territorial information can be complicated to achieve. But yes, 
no observed outbreaks with horrible results.

Yes, this is precisely the sort of stacking I do mean, and I do agree 
with you here. The reality is that attribution - from a legal 
perspective - emerged from the world of one author, one work (or perhaps 
two or three, but not the sort of collective authorship made possible by 
the network). I try to distinguish the legal obligation of attribution 
from the normative concept of citation to help with this problem. But 
there are some nice emergent technical solutions that may hold the 
promise of squaring at least part of the circle.

A few clarificiations....

Copyright protects works that are fixed and independently generated. That 2 paragraphs are identical is evidence of copyright infringement if it can be shown that one author had access to the other work, for example. Two works may be virtually identical but independently generated (the longer the text, the far less likely this is) in which case both are protected by copyright.

Coyright arises automatically (registration aids in litigation, but that is all), in which case as soon as your write the paper, even a draft manuscript it is protected by copyright. No formalities are required under international treaties. If there is no waiver, then all rights granted under copyright exist for the copyright holder (here need to be careful as this may be the employer in some contexts--employers generally require waiver of moral rights in employment contracts, it is also variable by jurisdiction as has already been stated, in sme jurisdictions it is not possible to wiave moral rights).

The US law you are referring to is called FRPAA which has been introduced in the US House of Representatives-- for information on this see http://www.arl.org/sparc/publications/articles/FRPAA-introduced-US-House-of-Representatives.shtml

My personal view is that while CCO or other waiver mechanisms are useful for data, especially on the issue of inter-operability of databases, but that the norm of attribution within the scientific community makes something similar to CC_By more appropriate for publications databases. Legal rules should ideally reflect or encode community norms. What is more important is public access. This may be negotiated with even non open access journals, say within 6 months, and this should be the focus of the debate, I think.

To play Devil's Advocate: if my database has been produced by data mining 
other people's texts, at what threshold level of use of their texts do I 
start to need to attribute?  How should my software decide?

I don't think this is likely.  My understanding is that much US Government 
research is released into the public domain (indeed, some of mine was, 
when I worked at Los Alamos National Lab).  But I've never heard anyone 
complain that this causes problems with plagiarism.  I'm sure there are 
cases scientists have sued one another before over this kind of thing, but 
I've never personally witnessed an instance.  On the other hand, I've 
personally seen dozens or hundreds of instances where community pressure 
has been brought to bear on issues around atttribution.

Well, clearly that's open to discussion, but software could naively decide
along the lines of "Am I reproducing a chunk of >n consecutive words", and
no doubt you could improve on that algorithm. But if you are going to
reproduce, say, two paragraphs of written work, you should attribute it
anyway, as per the community norms others have discussed. I don't think
having the community norms backed up by legal measures creates extra
problems for legitimate use.

I agree that it's fairly unlikely, but it is a potential downside, and I'm
still not convinced that there are upsides.

To those discussing the problems of multiple authorship: What about the way
Wikipedia deals with it? According to its terms of service (
http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Terms_of_Use), by submitting, you
license your contribution CC-BY-SA and GFDL, and you agree what attribution
will be considered sufficient (essentially a link to the page). Revision
history is, of course, recorded, so it's possible to see what each person
did, rather than a simple list of names. In fact, they do offer a list of
authors names as an option for attribution, but for obvious reasons, that's
probably almost never used.

Hi Tania,

Thanks for the clarifications.  I'm not referring to FRPAA.  As least as 
far back as 1995, I've frequently seen journals ask authors to transfer 
copyright in their papers to the journal, UNLESS the author works for the 
US Government.  In 1997 and 1998 I worked for the US Government, and it 
was explained to me that the reason for the exemption was because those 
works were in the public domain.  (An editor at a journal later confirmed 
this explanation.)  However, I'm certainly not an expert on copyright, and 
it's possible I misunderstood.

Legal rules should ideally reflect or encode community norms. What is more important is public access. This may be negotiated with even non open access journals, say within 6 months, and this should be the focus of the debate, I think.

[Only just catching up with this thread]

It's important to remember that the Panton Principles specifically
cite centrality of reuse and the *publicly funded* nature of work as a
reason for the PD-only approach. I should also point out that PP first
and foremost advocate 'open' data (as in http://opendefinition.org/)
with the PD recommendation being a further recommendation on top of
that. At least IMO (and I'm more of a social scientist than a
scientist) I really don't see much issue with Attribution in the
scientific area for data or publication.

As I wrote in a follow in a post last year:
<http://blog.okfn.org/2010/03/25/comments-on-the-panton-principles-and-data-licensing/>

<quote>
The Open Knowledge Foundation?s general position is one of supporting
open data where ?open? data includes data made available under
licenses with attribution and share-alike clauses, though
non-commercial restrictions are definitely not permitted (see
http://www.opendefinition.org/ for precise details). The reason for
excluding non-commercial is simple: share-alike is compatible with a
commons open to everyone but non-commercial is not.

Panton Principles 1-3 are, in essence, saying make data ?open? in the
sense of http://www.opendefinition.org/. Principle 4 goes beyond this
to specifically recommend public-domain only for data related to
published science, especially where the work is publicly funded.

The rationale for this ?stronger? position, at least for me, was that
a) science has existing (very) strong norms for attribution (and, to a
lesser extent, share-alike) b) science has strong up-front funding
support from society which reduces some of the risks that share-alike
addresses.

That said, I should emphasize that, in my view at least, the key
feature is that the data be made open ? public domain
dedication/licensing is ?strongly recommended? but if you end up with
an attribution or even share-alike type license that is still far, far
better than not making the data available at all, or licensing it
under non-commercial or other conditions.

 1. The chances of someone determined to rip me off my work without giving me attribution even if I require it via a contractual license? Greater than zero. 


2. The chances of me suing the person who indulges in #1 above? Zero (I have neither the time nor the resources to sue anyone).


3. The chances of someone deciding not to use my work because I contractually require attribution? Greater than zero.


4. The chances of a peer of mine using my work giving me proper credit because it is the right thing to do? Very high, because that is the community in which I live.


I will hedge my bets accordingly.


That said, in my view CC0 is perfect for most of my outputs, and CC-BY is alright for some of them, and both are better than either not putting my work out, or putting it out encumbered by requiring a more restrictive reciprocal obligation.

That is correct. If there is no copyright protection on a work there is 
no copyright to transfer to another entity.

Thanks everyone for the input!

Michael has put the argument for using the public domain to avoid
attribution stacking problems far more eloquently than I could have.

Michael and Tania: I believe the law you are talking about it is USC Title
17 Section 105, which specifies that "Copyright protection under this title
is not available for any work of the United States Government" -
http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/105.html - see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_status_of_work_by_the_U.S._governmentfor

Rufus, and all: Would you support a statement similar to the Panton
Principles but with a broader scope, directly addressing scientific text and
other communication mediums (audio/video of lectures, seminars) and pointing
to statements such as the Panton Principles, Open Biblio, and the Unlicense
for the other products of research? It seems to me that this would be very
helpful for the majority of scholars, who may have heard of open access
journals but haven't delved into the world of open science and the attendant
legal and technical issues; a clear statement and guidelines on why and how
to share scientific work, endorsed by the relevant organizations, might well
make them feel more comfortable 'opening up'.

Hence why I'm bringing up the public domain vs CC-BY - if the community
agrees that the public domain is as appropriate for writing as for data,
such a website should advise scientists to use the public domain in the
first instance and fall back on copyright licenses which meet the Open
Definition if they can't or won't use the public domain.

Best,
Marius

PS. I hope it's been clear that I use 'attribution' and 'citation' with the
same intended meanings as John Wilbanks outlined - attribution for the legal
requirement that is part of copyright and moral rights, and citation for the
non-legal standard of naming scholars when using or reproducing their work
or ideas.

Sorry, and I should clarify - if the community agrees that the public domain
is as appropriate for writing as for data _in the case of publicly funded
science_ (as Rufus pointed out above).

First of all I support this completely from the fundamental point of view. I
have some comments (concerns?) about the pragmatics

would see that the key thing was that the work was gifted to the
world/community with no intention of monetary reward (i.e. unlike a book -
there can still be publicly funded books which are sold and copyrighted).

The argument in the 1970s  (and I remember it) from some publishers is that
they *wanted* to protect authors from misuse of their work - they wanted
copyright transfer so they could act on the authors' behalf when others
starting ripping authors off. This IMO was either completely naive or
deliberately specious. However some publishers will claim that it is because
of their continued protection of authors (for which authors and readers pay)
that there is currently no rip-off - remove copyright and all hell breaks
out. This, of course, is rubbish but I expect this to be wheeled out to
policy-makers and we have to anticipate it.

The major problem is author apathy. Most hand their rights over without
thinking. They jump through absurd hoops to publish in the chosen brand.
This is an additonal requirement that they will not understand and will not
try to understand.

So if this is to happen it has to be through a funder-academia
collaboration. Given the low level of effective action by universities it is
down to funders at present. They are making progress in Open Access. We
would need to convince them that PD/CC0 was better than CC-BY. I'm not quite
sure how that will play. What is the single message I would give to a funder
to insist on CC0? (My position is that *if* we had CC0 I would be as happy
as with CC-By but it wouldn't make a lot of difference either way). I just
expect it to be difficult to sell for not very much additional benefit.

The academic/library/publishing system is besotted with copyright. We have a
huge culture to overcome.

I've been reading all the discussion and I have a point from the legal
part, althought I am not a lawyer.
In many European countries, basically the ones that follow the french
"droit d'auteur" system, two moral rights are "perpetual": atribution
and intergity. It means that when a work is in the public domain, i.e.
free to be used without restricions, those two moral rights are still
there.
I think CC0 is a good tool and I agree in defending norms instead of
legal obligations but in my opinion the use of CC0 in a work in some
European countries has the same effect that a CCBy because of those
two "perpetual" moral rights.
I think in the UK things are different, and of course in the US or Canada.

I am also playing devil's advocate because I support the defense and
the improvement of the public domain and in fact I have proposed to
change the Spanish law to include the possibility to dedicate works to
the public domain without wainting to the end of the copyright term.

Best

Ignasi

I think that in the next few years the institutions of science will  
conclude that most data should be published online with metadata and  
that the data should be discoverable, assessable, and *accessible  
according to terms defined in the metadata*. Today we have a narrow  
spectrum of options, but tomorrow we will have a broad spectrum of  
options, as in the attached figure from an article (http://www.geoconnexion.com/uploads/geo_rights_intv7i5.pdf 
) about how standards for Web service-based rights management of  
geospatial data are advancing in the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).

I think it's important to consider that two currencies of science are  
involved in the new business models of data curation -- money and  
recognition --- and both need to be managed in a Web services  
transaction environment. This cannot be accomplished without adequate  
Web service interface and encoding standards.

In my opinion, the discussion of CC0 vs public domain is good to have,  
but it is subordinate to the broader discussion of how we bring  
science into the Internet age. The broader discussion is most  
productive if it takes place as a discussion of requirements (the  
"Enterprise View" in the RM-ODP (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM-ODP)  
for technical standards. The standards can't be developed until the  
participants and stakeholder -- commercial and non-commercial -- agree  
on an overall vision. It can be done, as evidenced by the work of  
inclusive, consensus-based open standards development organizations  
like the OGC, W3C, IETF, OASIS and others.

Lance,
I agree with all you have said - I also agree that bringing science into the
Internet age is the most important thing.

I hope this is true. One of the aspects of geo-* is that it is required by
many other sciences and so there are multidisciplinary interests which
provide and urgency. As you point out we need to consider money - data is
not a costless operation - and in geo- there are many aspects of human
infrastructure which rely on geo- metadata.

Today we have a narrow spectrum of options, but tomorrow we will have a

> The problem is that every science is different (I'm simplifying them into
distinct areas but of course they overlap). They have different amounts of
history, practice, money-generation, regulation, etc. I like the spectrum of
categories you have such as "emergency". In the future I think we shall work
towards such a model for many disciplines.

"data" is not a simple or uniform concept.

Where it is possible to create organizations which are Open, non-profit (in
reality as well as name) which are distinct from practice , it can work.
Where the potential metadata creation is managed by a data provider which
thinks in a capitalist monopolist manner then the system is broken and
locked into dysfunction for decades. That's the case in chemistry - my own
subject - where there is no central community activity for metadata (there's
one small effort on identifiers) and where the major agggregators of data
see this as a monopolistic advantage. This holds in many scientific
subdomains and the primary challenge is to free this. It is unlikely to
happen through the process of managed consortia and workshops (there *are*
some slight indicators in chemistry, but I'm not optimistic).

Therefore we have to creatre an alterantive Open economy of data and
metadata. This is not easy as both of these may be attacked (without
justification but with corporate power). This is what Open Streetmap did -
they liberated much geo- data with 2-3 years. They same can happen
elsewhere, especially where government and non-profit depends on
interoperability.

That's why I see the OKF and related orgs as having a bottom-up role in
changing the world. Even if the first version is imperfect it change
people's attitudes. It hopefully changes the ideas of the large knowledge
corporates (though I'm an idealist).

So every power to OGC. I wish the model worked in every scientific
discipline. Unfortunately it doesn't.

So we are building Open Scholarship - Open Access, Open Bibliography, Open
Citations, Open Data. Some of these in some fields will give early results.
Others will take a decade or more

Hi All

This is a great discussion, I only wish there were better ways to capture
these things and present summaries. I just want to make two points:

First is that there is a diversity of opinion on what the important
principles are but those differences are primarily grounded in risk
assessment. In particular Rufus, John, Michael, and myself have subtly
different views on whether requirements for share-alike, attribution, pose
risks to the ability of people to re-use and redistribute derivative works
efficiently and how important these are in balance with concerns of free
loading (i.e. taking open content, commercialising and not giving back) as
well as the best pathway for persuading people to share more than they are
at the moment. 

I think we would all agree that in a perfect world everything would be in
the public domain and people would share constructively and contribute back
without needing any legal sticks to beat them. The world however is not
perfect, both people and legal systems are flawed. Our different views
essentially revolve around which of those flaws are more important to tackle
first and what the most important risks are to hedge against.

The second comment I?d made, echoing what I wrote in the answer on Quora and
what Rufus has written is that one place where we agree is that
non-commercial terms are a key critical area where we need to make progress.
Persuading the wider community to give up all rights is going to be really
tough. But making a strong united case against non-commercial terms seems to
me more tractable. So my advice (and my answer at quora) is fundamentally
one of pragmatic politics. The immediate battle we need to win is the one on
non-commercial terms so in my view that is the best place to expend energy.

Cheers

Cameron

The US Government example cited yesterday by Michael sounds quite a 
convincing argument that putting research texts in the public domain 
should not lead to plagiarism. I'd be interested to know about how it 
affects US research collaborations with industry considering shared 
interests in commercialising results and the freeloading issue Cameron 
mentioned. Its an interesting question whether authors using a PD 
licence would make life easier for open-access institutional 
repositories, with no short term adverse effects on authors - and 
benefits down the line from wider access.

It is good to hear that OKFN is a broad church!  I support the principle 
of a legal public domain and that many research products should be in 
it. I don't understand why such a sharp distinction is made here between 
legal rights and those normatively enforced by a community. Granted it 
should be clear what is a legal obligation and what isn't. But surely in 
practice this boundary evolves  in line with a community's view on the 
need for sanctions to enforce what they believe is the right thing? As 
far as I know (I'm an information scientists not a lawyer) researchers 
have a legal right to attribution as copyright holders, but no legal 
right as researchers per se (I've learned something about variations 
across jurisdiction from this discussion). I know researchers have a 
normative right to be attributed. But 'norms' only have effect to the 
extent communities orient their practices around them, and have the 
means to apply sanctions when they are not adhered to.  I believe 'moral 
rights' are so widely legally enforceable because it is a widely assumed 
'norm' that attribution is a good thing, across many communities and on 
a large scale- a point I think John Wilbanks is acknowledging in the 
point below.  For sure a 'public domain for everything' position has 
benefits in terms of clarity - which I think all researchers want, and 
in terms of computability- which some researchers want.

The point I'm getting to is why is it a good thing to replace one 
absolute position (everything is legally protected) with another 
(nothing is legally protected), rather than define in machine readable 
terms the policies that those with a stake in the research agree are 
right for the purpose, and leave the law as a mechanism of last resort 
for resolving differences?  You might gather I see the value of PP as a 
kind of manifesto to use in an argument for culture change, but think 
researchers should be forced to give up rights through mandates only of 
there is a strong consensus in their own community.

On another point...

Surely referencing practices embrace both attribution and citation, and 
generally work without a need for legal protection because they have 
been established by research communities that are cohesive enough to 
agree standards and work to them, rather than because attribution and 
citation have some essential property that puts them in separate spheres?

I'd like to better understand why citation standards are considered 
broken by the increasing numbers of authors on articles. Because they 
encroach on the page/screen space available for articles?  BTW I'm sure 
Galaxy zoo, which was mentioned as an example of collective authorship 
has an ethical code for citizen science that requires citizen 
contributions to be attributed, so it would be useful to know how big an 
issue it is there.

One final point of confusion for me - can anyone please explain why the 
need to cite research articles creates an attribution stacking problem?
confused!

Slightly off-topic question, although I believe it's in the same spirit.

How is CC0 waiver compatible with agreements one has with employer
concerning managing IP rights? Scientific texts are usually of little
interests to universities, but they often do care about educational
materials. In theory it should be easier to dedicate such materials to
PD/CC0 (or whatever is the proper phrase), as authors of
textbooks/courses don't rely on citations that much as scientists.

Any ideas?

In the United States (possibly elsewhere as well), your work-for-hire 
contract with your employer will likely preempt anything you can or may 
do. Check your employees manual, or ask your institution's legal 
department that should be happy to assist with such issues.

Many of us in OKF want to see Open Theses but the ground rules are different
(the copyright is normally the student's) and the challenge is with the
universities to address this rather than primary and secondary publishers.
So just as important but a different type of activity.

well, l tried my best and here we go:

CTT's first article in the Public Domain published today:

Gratwohl A.: Theoretical and practical issues of autologous versus allogeneic stem cell transplantation in multiple sclerosis, http://www.ctt-journal.com/2-6-en-gratwohl-2011jan14.html

Hi,

I applaud your gesture. I'd just like to point out that the language used on
the article is contradictory:
"? The Author. This article is provided under the following license:
Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain
Dedication<http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>
 "

The work can be copyrighted by the author or public domain, but not both.
Also, CC0 is only partly a license; first and foremost it's a waiver, and it
only uses licensing as a fall-back option.

In general, these sorts of issues are the sorts of things people need to be
educated about if the public domain is to become a normal venue for
publishing science.

Best,
Marius

I think this is a great example of the sort of information that the
community should agree upon - with the aid of legal specialists - and make
centrally available on a website. I know that the CC website has an
excellent guide to using their tools, including CC0, but I think at the
moment scientists will need a lot of hand-holding to use it - and rightly
so, nobody gets into science with the expectation of having to thinking hard
about the legal status of their work! A centralised guide for would-be open
scientists could prevent situations like this from happening in the future,
and easy life for everybody.

Consider the details of this particular situation: the CTT website has been
changed to read:
"? The Author. This article is provided under the following license as a
waiver:
Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication"

CC recommends the following formula, which avoids some of the problems we
have right now:
"To the extent possible under law, ___ has waived all copyright and related
or neighboring rights to ___. This work is published from: ___."

see http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/ for more details.

It seems to me that if even people who read this mailing list and fully
believe in open science are getting the legal issues around using the public
domain wrong, we shouldn't be surprised that "normal" scientists aren't
using the public domain! Hence, I maintain, the need for a user-friendly,
one-stop-shop website for opening your science.

Lastly, I hope it's clear that I fully applaud your efforts on this,
Claudia, and I don't mean to criticize what you're doing - on the contrary,
I think it's amazing news!

Best wishes,
Marius

? 
fine with me, Marius, and thank you very much for this opportunity, let us do some e-learning together :-)
some jump, me included

so this sounds like a good idea to me:

> I think this is a great example of the sort of information that the community should agree upon - with the aid of legal specialists - and make centrally available on a website. I know that the CC website has an excellent guide to using their tools, including CC0, but I think at the moment scientists will need a lot of hand-holding to use it - and rightly so, nobody gets into science with the expectation of having to thinking hard about the legal status of their work! A centralised guide for would-be open scientists could prevent situations like this from happening in the future, and easy life for everybody.

Hence, I maintain, the need for a user-friendly, one-stop-shop website for opening your science.

any idea for funding such an effort and whom to pay? 
?

here you might be able to help yet again: where exactly did you find the recommendation you quote above?

> Lastly, I hope it's clear that I fully applaud your efforts on this, Claudia, and I don't mean to criticize what you're doing - on the contrary, I think it's amazing news!

feels like it is amazing, yes,

looking forward to you next lesson, Marius :-)

... and of course we might take my jumps as step-by-step (from bad to better) examples elsewhere, too :-)

Claudia

Subject: [open-science] Minutes from WG Meeting Jan 12 2011
Message-ID: <AANLkTin2rXJveN1i-g1uZ9TM=aOPnLGFK-vbWbbDD2kc@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

See below for a summary of key points from the WG meeting on Jan 12 2011,
I've listed here the main updates, followed by a list of things you could
contribute to and any interesting events that are coming up. If you'd like
more detailed updates on projects or to view the full minutes, visit
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-meetings

-------------------
Updates:

Panton Principles:
- Panton Papers are still in progress, a first draft deadline of 15th Feb
has been set for those with authors assigned. To join the collaborative
discussion and drafting effort, have a look at the current papers and ideas
listed at http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers and contribute your
thoughts. We are hoping to publish these at BMC, so if you'd like to
formally contribute to writing a paper then make yourself known on the pad
or drop me an email so we can keep track of authors and progress.
- Once the papers are nearing completion there may need to be some thematic
linking between the various topics, and a list of Panton Papers relevant
references may be compiled to add to open bibliographies.
- A page on the Panton Principles website detailing case studies and best
practise in open scientific data was suggested. This will be discussed again
at the next working group meeting, so please add any ideas you have in the
mean time to the January meeting pad.

Public Health Research Data:
- A major joint statement from public health research funders regarding
sharing research data was published this week:
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Data-sharing/Public-health-and-epidemiology/WTDV030690.htm
If you have any feedback on priorities for implementing the statement, or
you'd like to get involved, see this link for contact details:
http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Spotlight-issues/Data-sharing/Public-health-and-epidemiology/WTDV030693.htm

Online Tools:
- A new tool was released this week by Science 3.0. FigShare - alpha
http://figshare.com/ allows users to share data by uploading figures which
would otherwise by unpublished, under a CC-BY license. For more information
see http://figshare.com/figblog/2011/01/12/figshare-alpha-release/
- CKAN http://ckan.net has many science data packages, but to maximise
usefulness it would be great to have somebody maintaining particular groups
of packages e.g. the chemistry group.


------------------
Things to Do!

1) Collaborate in drafting Panton Papers at
http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers
2) Volunteer to maintain some of the science packages at CKAN eg.
http://ckan.net/group/chemistry, this would be a small but very worthwhile
time commitment to ensure CKAN is as useful and up to date as
possible.<http://bit.ly/cFgi94><http://bit.ly/cFgi94>
3) The annual OKF conference OKCon will be taking place again next year and
we are looking for suggestions of speakers to invite for a science themed
stream - check the pad for current suggestions and add your own.
4) Make some Is It Open? requests! For more information see Heather's blog
posts at http://science.okfn.org/ and visit http://www.isitopendata.org/ to
make your request.
5) Upload figures to http://figshare.com/, and encourage your colleagues to
do the same!

I know that the CC website has an excellent guide to using their tools, including CC0, but I think at the moment scientists will need a lot of hand-holding to use it - and rightly so, nobody gets into science with the expectation of having to thinking hard about the legal status of their work! A centralised guide for would-be open scientists could prevent situations like this from happening in the future, and easy life for everybody.

while I am still interested in your answer, Marius, especially for the third part which I have not seem used so farit occurred to me that, in a journal and given our general article layout, we'd still need a place on an article's web page that signals "here you can read something about copyright"and that it would probably be easiest to find if there was an icon as expectedwhat is your take, everyone, wouldn't it make sense to replace the c by the inverted c of copyleft - a change that will be barely noticed, maybe, but yet do the trick ;-)so we could write:

 The Author has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this article - to the extent possible under law. [plus maybe the third sentence the significance of which I have not yet understood for our journal context]

has anyone seen the copyleft symbol in unicode yet?(the one above I found here http://www.tacticsarena.com/forum/showthread.php?40131-Copyleft-Symbol-in-Unicode - but is too conspicuous, maybe, for my purposes) btw, in LaTeX see: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=466051next lesson, please :-)cheers,Claudia

I'm not in any way legally-trained, only an interested scientist. However,
the wording, and also a logo you can use to signify a work's public domain
status, can be found by following the instructions at
http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/; an example, with made-up metadata,
can be found at
http://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/results?license-class=zero&name=asd&actor_href=asd&work_title=asd&work_jurisdiction=AE&confirm=confirm&understand=confirm&field1=continue&waiver-affirm=affirm.
The CC0 faq explains the significane of the 'This work is published from
___' clause (see
http://wiki.creativecommons.org/CC0_FAQ#Why_do_some_works_indicate_the_jurisdiction_from_which_the_work_is_being_published.3F
).

The practical approach to this, IMO, is authoring tools. If we can get to a
stage where there are Open Source llicence addins for all common tools
(Word, OO, LyX, etc.) then I think the scientific community will adjust. If,
for example, the tool advises to author that before saving the author is
recommended to make all appropriate components of the paper Open scientists
will do it. If they don't understand then the tool can present them with an
explanation of why they should use CC-BY or CC0, why they should not use
CC-NC, why they should stamp their data as Open Data, etc.

The problem is getting the addins into authors tools. If the tools also give
them other benefits  such as helping them manage their publication list,
manage references, etc. we might get take-up. Then it will grow
exponentially.

I don?t think there is a problem with including a copyright statement as
well as the CC0. The copyright is retained by the authors. It?s the fact
that they hold rights that gives them the ability to apply a CC0 (or PDDL)
waiver to this specific copy that they are releasing under those terms. So I
can?t see a problem with

? The authors. You are free to use any part of this article in any way
without restrictions. The authors request that where you use the article or
portions of the article that you cite it as follows:______

This web version of the article is made available under a Creative Commons
Zero Waiver. To the extent possible under law,?## authors##?have waived all
copyright and related or neighboring rights to?##title##. This work is
published from:?##address of journal##

As always IANAL, TINLA. Creative Commons did some work on ?norm badges? with
the idea that you could mark up what you were asking for in terms of
citation, referencing, re-use etc, without making it a legal obligation but
I?m not sure how far that work got in the end?

If anybody is interested in working on the "centralised guide" idea, I've
ported the Panton Principles to scientific writing here:
http://typewith.me/p4bdOCBD18. Feedback etc very much desired!

Message-ID: <AANLkTin=BVAGs2mwp9hgnVL5LFpCdhBfDR3W=qXgqVX=@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All

Our last meeting was very productive, and as the current Panton Papers are
due to be at first draft stage by 15th Feb (get collaborating at
http://science.okfnpad.org/PantonPapers!), we'll meet again just after that
deadline. This is quite advance notice so I'll send a reminder closer to the
date!

When:      Wednesday 16th February at 17.30 GMT
Location:  #okfn IRC channel on oftc.net (quick link http://ur1.ca/4fh) and
Skype (add your Skype ID to http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011)

Please add your name and Skype ID to the list of attendees on
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-16Feb2011
Add anything you'd like to be discussed or new ideas to the agenda (even if
you can't make it yourself, just make sure you add enough details).

Thanks very much, and I look forward to speaking to you all soon.

Jenny
