Subject: [open-science] toward a low-overhead fastpath for open-science
	"publishing"
Message-ID: <87r4royf2f.fsf@pobox.com>


summary: let's produce something like a fastpath (more below)
demonstrating an open-science "publishing" (more below) process
suitable for use by the very-early-career or #scholarlypoor
aspiring scientist. I sketch parts of one (below the line).

details:

Thanks all for your interesting talk today

http://ckan.okfnpad.org/meetup-2012-08-02

Since there seemed to be interest (at least, from me :-), and since I
think it's a fairly general usecase that might be useful for (e.g.)
tutorials/howto's/etc, and since I'd definitely appreciate suggestions
for improvement (esp of ease-of-use :-), here's some more detail about
what I'm trying to do, and how. (Got a better way to communicate/
collaborate on this particular topic? Please lemme know.)

What I hope will emerge from this (eventually :-) is a "fastpath" for
open-science "publishing" suitable for folks like me:

"Fastpath" (a term from my years coding for a massive three-letter
acronym) refers to a document for a demo. (Or the script for a demo
video.) A fastpath is one level below a howto--even more hands on,
with even less explanation: "type this, then click that, and you'll
get this thing." Fastpaths instill confidence (to the extent they are
completely replicable), and can convince the audience to learn more.
(Notably, to RTFM--which the fastpath's intended audience is usually
loathe to do.) Note that a fastpath doesn't need to be, and usually
isn't, the "absolute best way" to do something (which usually varies
by practitioner): it's just so drop-dead easy and robust (and is
therefore usually designed before, and developed with, the code it
documents) "even Marketing can run it." FWIW, one part of an
open-science publishing fastpath should definitely be

http://trac.ckan.org/ticket/2796

I put "publishing" in quotes because the domain I target includes many
activities (e.g., logging, collaboration) that terminate (more or
less) in generation of formally-structured content ("FSC"). The other
activities are unfortunately disrespected relative to that which gets
funding, tenure, etc--such is life.

And, in my own self-interest, I'm also definitely interested in
assistance and mentoring with my own effort in this space, which
follows; your comments/suggestions are appreciated.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

AUDIENCE: very-early-career science students (I'm a master's student)
and workers who

1 are reasonably "neterate," i.e., can work with fairly high-level
  descriptions of internet-available sites/services and the tools/
  protocols available for their access

2 must publish (if only a thesis) to "get ahead" (i.e., the
  second-lowest level of the precariat), but haven't yet (or not
  enough)

3 want to "be open," i.e., to have their project's plans, data, and
  artifacts publicly available (minimally, for collaboration). Extra
  credit for exaltation of "replication in computational science"

http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/replication-i.html

  (and thanks to Cameron Neylon for passing that pointer)

4 are #scholarlypoor in

- time, notably because they're so busy learning the domain about
  which they need to publish that they lack time to invest in
  optimizing publishing tools and processes

- money, to pay someone(s) to handle the more strictly publishing-
  oriented tasks which they might prefer to offload.

Note my audience is more early-career, and my task (below) more
individually focused, than would suit someone like Ethan Perlstein,
whose Journal Wordpress

http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2012-July/001754.html

I see as targeting the science worker at the next career level up: a
team builder who is necessarily more focused on team funding,
management, and marketing.

TASK: with minimum investment of (e.g.) time, money, effort,

1 make project content (e.g., plans, data, visualizations) publicly
  available *over time*: i.e., so as to be

* easily editable (including adding, subtracting, and linking
  artifacts) by authors and collaborators

* easily citable (from, e.g., webpages, email, blogs)

* secure (from vandalism and loss)

  at annual scale (e.g., 1-5 years, or however long a PhD takes
  wherever you are).

2 ease migration/transformation of project content from state="raw"
  (i.e., primarily consumed by one's team) to state="publishable"
  (i.e., suitable for formal submission to formal internal or external
  publishers or reviewers, in the formats demanded by the latter).

STRATEGY: I'm either doing or intending to do this now by

1 using a github wiki to maintain a group of pages and associated
  media relating to the project, including a top-level page (currently

https://github.com/TomRoche/cornbeltN2O/wiki/Simulation-of-N2O-Production-and-Transport-in-the-US-Cornbelt-Compared-to-Tower-Measurements

  ) from which one should be able to discover

* project intent

* project status

* find what one seeks within the project (provided it's there :-)

  Unfortunately github's wiki docs are (IMHO) relatively poor, though,
  since the wiki is a repo, one benefits from the generally-excellent
  git docs.

2 storing and processing data, and generating related products (e.g.,
  visualizations), with maximum automation and reproducibility. This
  entails

2.1 storing both raw and processed data and products in public
    datastores

    I'll need to keep local copies of processable data anyway (notably
    due to latency and processing requirements), and my organization
    has a capable-looking hierarchical filesystem, so I'm not so
    concerned about data security when evaluating public datastores. I
    also understand (better, after the talk) the costs associated with
    DOI minting and maintenance, and must accommodate that. But my
    datasets are fairly large (GBs, not yet TBs), so capacity is
    definitely an issue. So I'm thinking I will

  * publish DOI-worthy data and products at public DOI providers
    (e.g., pangaea.de (earth-science-specific), figshare.com), so as
    to stay within space limits for each provider.

  * publish raw-er data and products, for which DOIs are less
    necessary, at non-DOI-providers such as thedatahub.org et al
    (e.g., github), so as to stay within space limits for each
    provider.

    (datadryad.org also seems useful, but *much* too late in the
    process. Why wait to open-store your data until you have a
    published article? Am I missing something?)

2.2 processing data and generating products using open-source and
    publicly-available code and "engines" (e.g., compilers, VMs)

    I'm only partly compliant: I use mostly R for my own work, but
    generate the base-level data using legacy models which currently
    rely on proprietary compilers.

2.3 managing code with open-source SCMS and public datastores (aka
    repositories).

    git+github seems fine for this; but, as with previous, there are a
    lotta good tools and services in this space. (That being said,
    github has some excellent documents that could be easily
    incorporated into a fastpath.) I write R, but have not been
    packaging it: gotta start doing that.

3 managing references with open-source RMS and public datastores.

  Lotta range here, from all-the-way FOSS (e.g., zotero) to mixed
  public/proprietary (e.g., mendeley, IIUC).

4 generating formally-structured content ("FSC"--e.g., articles,
  posters, presentations) directly (with maximum automation and
  reproducability) from more process-oriented content ("POC"--in the
  above, wiki(s) and datastore(s)).

PROBLEMS: include, more-or-less in order from least to most severe:

1 Gollum, the github's wiki's rendering engine--at least, the
  publicly-deployed version--is butt-ugly. For aesthetics, I miss
  mediawiki, but the version to which I have access is behind a
  firewall, for which it's hard to enable access. (And MW does not
  support interaction via git repo, which I very much like about
  github's wiki. And backing up an MW is still a PITA, at least
  relative to backing up a git repo.)

2 Gollum does not currently support automatic table-of-contents
  generation, which

* makes page navigation *much* more difficult

* requires lots of manual internal-link generation

3 I am *quite* far from an FSC-generation solution--I've been putting
  it off to generate more POC (which make the bosses happy). I need to
  spend some time with Carl Boettiger's stack

http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2012-April/001520.html

  and look @ dexy (nominated by Cameron Neylon)

  before some upcoming conferences.

your assistance is appreciated (as is just reading this far :-)

I have read it. There's an awful lot and it will take a lot of coordination
as well as implementation. Can it be done in stages?

And not also that there are several groups thinking like you who are doing
bottom-up things. Much of this may be integratoin - and from my own
experience that takes time.

But good luck

... as noted in original

>> [A fastpath should] therefore usually designed before, and developed
>> with, the code it documents

But, as I should have noted in the original (but added above), a
fastpath just needs to be *relatively* drop-dead easy. I.e., for a
ginormous task like a scientific project, a fastpath need only be more
deterministic and much, *much* faster. And it can be assembled @
runtime from previously-prepared components:

> [A fastpath would probably be] an awful lot and it will take a lot
> of coordination as well as implementation. Can it be done in stages?

Yes. What follows is

* just one way to do this. YMMV. Alternatives welcome.

* based on my current service/tool choices, which may be waay
  suboptimal, but are known to work ... somewhat :-) See problems
  noted in original.

* based largely on my experience as a corporate coder (through late
  naughties), which worked then (but goes stale fast in IT-time):

  My previous gig was developing IDEs for other corporate developers
  (very "meta") working mostly with java and XML, but also legacies like
  SQL and COBOL. (aside: COBOL is not dead--there's GLOCs of it in
  production, everywhere--it's undead :-) So we had to simulate the
  automation of relatively-specialized tasks for folks working in
  (code-wise) quite built-up but very closed environments. (Notably,
  FIRE: that's "where the money is," but those folks *absolutely* don't
  want their code made public.)

  Salesfolk (prettier than coders :-) would demo our wizzy tool du jour
  (e.g., a drag-n-drop diagram editor allowing one to represent
  architectures at a high level and interact with them via wizards
  (i.e., sequences of dialogs) for generating/modifying/deploying code)
  using previously-written fake-but-realistic-looking (I'll call that
  "PWFBRL") components. We used these canned components because actually
  writing them at "demo-time" would have been slow and boring and not
  what the target audience was interested in. So a demo-er would
  therefore spend a fair amount of time saying/doing things like
  (just OTTOMH):

  "So here's your legacy for creating a global-economy-destroying
  derivative contract [click on diagram node opens PWFBRL COBOL in an
  editor]. As you can see [scrolling], it calls foo, bar, and baz
  [clicks in code navigator opening other PWFBRL sources]. And here
  [more navigator clicks] are your triggers in the customer database
  [scrolling more editors showing PWFBRL SQL, putting more nodes on the
  diagram]. And here's your website for your vampire-squid clients [more
  clicks, scrolling, nodes, PWFBRL java, HTML, XML]. Now we're gonna
  invert control [a major naughties buzzphrase] with callbacks in the
  [your framework here--java is all about frameworks :-] fa?ade [and
  about design patterns :-] [lots more clicks, drags, some typing]. Now
  let's recompile [click], and run this sucker [open browser, type a
  little]--et voil?!" [applause]

ISTM CKAN could do likewise. Here's an example (for convenience
only--nothing set in stone, noting caveats from first post in this
thread, and I may be missing something(s)):

1 Know/determine your target audience. (Always job #1.)

2 Imagine (better: copy/modify) a publication-oriented science project
  that is

* sufficiently generic to be understandable by the target audience

* sufficiently interesting to appeal to the target audience

Consider skipping ahead to step=7 (usecase generation), or just do
that in parallel with the following steps (3..6):

3 Project goal: formally-structured content (FSC):

3.1 Imagine (better: copy/modify) one or more FSC instances that the
    project owner(s) would want to generate (e.g., an article, poster,
    presentation).

3.2 Choose FSC generation (FSCG) tool/service(s):

    Probably your major design decision. You will be criticized--get
    over it !-) You want something that outputs pretty FSCs, for which
    inputs are easy/quick to author, that is easy to setup, that
    operates robustly, has good support/community, and <your criteria
    here/>.

    Test your choice: create simple input(s), feed to your FSCG,
    inspect output, loop until you're satisfied.

4 Project-oriented content (POC):

* Data: create/steal some project-relevant data, and decide how to
  manage it (e.g., with thedatahub).

* Code: create/steal some code that does something with the data, and
  decide how to manage it (e.g., with git+github).

* References: fake/steal some references about the project domain, and
  store them appropriately.

5 Get meta: "eat your own dogfood" by managing *this project* (the
  creation of a fastpath) using the tools/services you will be demoing
  in the fastpath. (Or not :-)

6 Create top-level node: see strategy item 1 in

http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-science/2012-August/001760.html

6.1 Create something publicly-available (e.g., a wiki homepage) from
    which one should be able to discover project status, intent, and
    content. This is the project TLN.

6.2 Populate the TLN with POC (e.g., plans, status, visualizations) to
    scroll in the demo. (If a wiki, POC can be in other pages in the
    same wiki--i.e., implement the TLN as a site.)

6.3 Since users will be spending much time in the TLN, satisfy
    yourself regarding the ease of editing, navigation, and searching
    the TLN itself, as well as the content it contains/indexes.

6.4 Add your FSC input and output to the TLN. Repeat usability testing.

7 Create demo-worthy usecases. These might include any of the
  following, and new usecases can be added as you have resource and
  interest:

* adding a new phase/activity to the TLN/site about incorporating new
  data (which needs added to the datastore, etc)

* adding new POC to the TLN. E.g., you need a new visualization, so
  you create or edit new code (which you manage), you run the code, 
  you add the visualization to the project site (and perhaps the FSC).

* editing/regenerating your FSC (adding new code, figures, etc).

N Write something out. Demo on yourself. Demo to a friendly audience.
  Put a rough draft on your blog. "Go live" to a "real" audience.
  Record a screencast, release it to the world. Add new usecases,
  refactor the whole thing. Choose new tools/services. Smile when
  folks fork it, change everything, and proclaim your inferiority.
  Change the world and die happy :-)

"This session deals with climate-model software quality and transparent
publication of model descriptions, software, and results. The models are
based on physical theories but implemented as software systems that must be
kept bug-free, readable, and efficient as they evolve with climate science.
How do open source and community-based development affect software quality?
What are the roles of publication and peer review of the scientific and
computational designs in journals or other curated online venues? Should
codes and datasets be linked to journal articles? What changes in journal
submission standards and infrastructure are needed to support this? We
invite submissions including experience reports, case studies, and visions

this blog post:
http://science.okfn.org/2012/08/07/get-your-ticket-for-okfest-today-early-bird-closes-august-8th/

We have a great two days lined up on Wednesday 19th and Thursday 20th
September. Sessions will include a keynote by Mat Todd on Open Source Drug
Discovery, an interactive session with Carl-Christian Bohr to discuss the
European Commission's open science policy, and panel discussions on
communicating science (including representatives from academia, science
publishing and wikimedia), making open access work in practice, and opening
up raw experimental data (led by Mark Hahnel from Figshare). There will
also be a host of workshops, hands-on sessions and drafting sprints, so do
come and join us!

On Tuesday 18th September, we will be holding a satellite hackday. Details

This is an invitation to a national seminar on the subject of research
equipment data sharing, supported by EPSRC and hosted by the University of
Southampton, with key note speaker Professor Nigel Shadbolt.
The UNIQUIP<http://www.uniquip.org/> Project, launched in July this year,
was established with the aim of driving developments in the sharing of
research facilities and equipment datasets.
This two day seminar will facilitate discussions and debate in some of the
key areas of data sharing including ?

-          Vocabulary development - creating data rich information

-          Technology developments - including interoperability

-          Sustainable practices - managing and integrating data

-          The future ? creating national data sets
This event aims to demonstrate that the vision of sharing equipment data at
a national level can be realised.
With presentations from CERIF, EPSRC and across the data.ac.uk community,
the seminar promises to provide some fascinating insights, spaces are
limited so register as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.
When?
 18th and 19th September

Where?
University of Southampton

Cost?
Free

Just a quick note:

Wiley have sent out a press release today to announce that they have
changed the licensing conditions of their 'WileyOpenAccess' branded
journals.
http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-104537.html

They have now adopted the Creative Commons Attribution
(CC-BY<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/>)
licence.

I and many others have repeatedly pointed out that the label
'WileyOpenAccess' doesn't fit the CC BY-NC license they were previously
using. So this is a small but welcome victory for common sense and Open
Access.


Best,

Ross

Greetings dear list members,

Its been a while since I posted here, but I am doing so now with some good news -- I have accepted the newly formed position of Policy Coordinator for Science and Data at Creative Commons.

I will be joining Timothy Vollmer and the rest of the CC team in the Bay Area later this month.

I look forward to working with you all toward our common interest in enabling permanently free and open access to scientific data.

Message-ID: <7E233ED5-D78D-4094-8807-9F3ADA7DAC62@gmail.com>

Hi All

Sorry for pinging multiple lists, but I'm just saying hello and introducing myself, so it seemed better than repeating the same info in different place.

I'm an organic chemist/biochemist by training and have worked in computational chemistry and drug design for the past 8 years.  I'm finishing my EngD applying drug design concepts to the development of materials for protein separation, so I have experience of QSAR methods, structure and ligand based drug design, machine learning, and data visualisation using R, Python and Pipeline Pilot.  I also have a smattering of SQL - MySQL, Oracle, sqlite, Sphynx - and I write LaTeX, Sweave, R Markdown/KintR. 

I'm interested in expanding my skills in data analysis and coding in R and Python and I'm looking for an excuse to make myself get to grips with Javascript and interactive data visualization.  I'm also interested in exploring text mining and big data techniques.  

I'd be interested in getting involved in some of the OKFN projects, if my skills are applicable.

Feel free to point me in the right direction or get in touch if you think I might be able to contribute to your work.

Thanks
Hassan

IT as a Utility Network+
=======================

IT as a Utility (ITaaU) is one of the 4 sub-themes of the RCUK Digital Economy programme <http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/research/xrcprogrammes/Digital/Pages/home.aspx> . The ITaaU Network purpose is to promote and enhance the community interested in this aspect of the DE programme and help co-ordinate activities in this area.

IT as a Utility is about the provision of information and technology in a transparent and highly usable manner. It is closely related to Grid and Cloud Computing with its emphasis on making IT resources effortlessly and almost invisibly available the end user. Cloud paradigms for access to applications and infrastructure are now well established, and are changing the way users interact with applications, especially where the application is accessible from multiple devices and users.

See www.itutility.ac.uk (this is being updated and a new version will appear soon)

The RCUK Digital Economy Programme Theme has identified four challenge areas of which IT as a Utility is one.  We have recently been awarded a Network+ grant to promote the ITaaU challenge area.

We wish to appoint a suitably qualified Network Co-ordinator (NC) for the Digital Economy (DE) challenge area, IT as a Utility Digital Economy (ITaaU) Network+.  The University of Southampton, along with the partner Universities, has a very strong reputation in Digital Economy research, as well as e-Science and ICT in general.   Digital Economy forms one of the University of Southampton's Strategic Research Groups (USRG).

The Network Co-ordinator will be responsible for the co-ordination of network activities, including network organisation, outreach and community engagement, community and specialist workshops, sandpits, secondments and pilot project organisation, and other activities necessary for the efficient running and growth of an active network providing the research community with a way to exchange and evolve ideas within the ITaaU area.

In addition to the co-ordination of the network and help with the management of the network, it is intended to run the network itself as an example of using IT as a Utility and the Network Co-ordinator will be involved in empirical research based on the network activities as a research example of ITaaU.

The network co-ordinator will be based at the University of Southampton and will be required to work with the other network investigators (based at QMUL, Nottingham and Belfast).

The position is available immediately at a salary level of ?27,578 (ERE level 4) and is available as a full time position.  However, part time / job share options would be possible, depending on experience.  Funding for this position is available until March 2015.  Travel away from Southampton will be necessary as will some overnight visits. The role may also involve international travel.

The ideal applicant will have at least a moderate technical background with a user and social dimension, with a PhD or comparable industrial or applied experience in a science, social science or technical area.  Experience in organising events such as workshops, conferences, sandpits, as well as helping to run, develop and publicise group activities is highly desirable along with excellent social and networking skills.

Message-ID: <87ipceqwmc.fsf@pobox.com>


iemHUB  http://iemhub.org/  (IEM==integrated environmental modeling)
HUBzero http://hubzero.org/

Dunno how suitable these are as open-science platforms, since I know
much too little about them, but they seem interesting. (Esp since
there seems to be some US-governmental interest in backing it--see
references to EPA (a Federal agency), and RTI (a large NGO/contractor)
below.) So I'm passing along some all-too-rough notes (I just don't
type fast enough) from an "iemHUB 101" session I recently attended.
(I'll try to get/pass the slides.) I'm hoping more knowledgeable folks
will render their considered judgments on either HUBzero or the
UK-based myexperiment.org, to which the presenter explicitly referred.

I'm especially interested in the compute platforms (e.g.,
OpenScienceGrid). Suppose we use the term "computationally poor" to
refer to those lacking access to high-performance scientific computation
(and expensive proprietary software, e.g., ArcGIS) but can't afford it,
? la the "scholarly poor" who need to read scholarly literature but
can't: how accessible and useful are these platforms to the
"computationally poor"?

<notes>

HUBzero developed @ Purdue http://hubzero.org/
"HUBzero is the underlying software" for iemHUB
"large integrated feature set", community/collaboration platform
real differentiator is the computational platform (more below)
"closest thing to HUBzero is myexperiment.org in the UK" 
http://www.myexperiment.org/

hubs are HUBzero instances
iemHUB has "no specific organizational identity", is open to anyone interested in IEM (integrated environmental modeling)
http://iemhub.org/

then long talk about the software, HUBzero
collaboration focus
can publish software tools on it, but VC == subversion :-(
biggest community is nanotechnology: "nanoHUB is the oldest hub" http://nanohub.org/ "going for about a decade"
forums: answering questions earns points
bugtracker
this is sounding a lot like sourceforge (which they namecheck, also github)

MAJOR DIFFERENCE: can run software on their cloud !?!
"lots of grids out there you can submit jobs to", e.g., OpenScienceGrid
http://www.opensciencegrid.org/
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Science_Grid_Consortium
sounds like iemHUB is front-ending to them!
one can also install software (he specifically mentions R) on the hub!

"rapture is a tool available within iemHUB" for q'n'd GUI creation: works with fortran as well as the usual suspects

while speaker goes on, look around:

The slides for the HUBzero portion of the presentation are @

They're quite image-intensive, but still manage to render (apparently)
properly in libreoffice on my debian box. There is also a movie of the
presentation (apparently--I haven't viewed either) @

Hi Sridhar,

I have recently started getting involved with a group also involved in setting up an open source seeds program. Please contact me off-list. We may have a fair amount to share and work with.

Message-ID: <CAMQ+bMbY1gzUCzqc_XzHq6afgbdCtRk6dbo-9w-=kVbsPub_hw@mail.gmail.com>

   *Digital Research 2012*

 10-12 September 2012
 St Catherine?s College, Oxford, UK

  http://digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk

 Digital Research practice, tools and infrastructures have been embraced by
researchers across all disciplines. The landscape is changing rapidly, with
the Web as our research environment and also a lens onto our society and
world. Researchers across sciences and humanities are facing the
opportunities and challenges of new forms of data and big data analytics,
and harnessing the technological advances of new devices and
"e-Infrastructure" including High Performance Computing and the Cloud.

   *Digital Research 2012* features an exciting three-day programme with a
great set of speakers, bringing the community together to showcase today?s
digital research practice and innovation and set an influential agenda for
tomorrow. We welcome researchers, research technologists and developers at
all stages of their careers. Here are some highlights of the programme -
please see the website for the full programme and registration information:

 *New Science of New Data Symposium* and *Innovation Showcase* (Monday
10th).  Keynotes from social network analysis expert *Noshir
Contractor*(Northwestern University) on Web Science, government open
data director
*Nigel Shadbolt* on Open Data, and a closing address by philosopher,
computer scientist and political writer *Kieron O'Hara* - with twitter
analytics, geolocated social media and informational citizenship in
between.  Also the launch of the *Software Sustainability Institute's
Fellows Programme *and the community innovation showcase and workshops.

 *Future of Digital Research* (Tuesday 11th).  Keynotes from *Stevan
Harnad*on "Digital Research: How and Why the RCUK Open Access Policy
Needs to Be
Revised", *Jim Hendler* (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) on "Broad Data"
(not just big!), and *Lizbeth Goodman* (UCD) on "SMART spaces by and for
SMART people". Sessions are themed on Open Science (with a data publishing
panel), Smart Spaces as a Utility and future glimpses from the community,
all culminating in a Roundtable discussion on the Future of Digital
Research.

 *e?Infrastructure Forum* and *Innovation Showcase* (Wednesday 12th). We
open with a dual-track community innovation showcase, then launch the UK
e-Infrastructure Academic Community Forum where *Peter Coveney* (UK
e-Infrastructure Leadership Council and UCL) will present the "state of the
nation" followed by a Provider?s Panel, Software, Training and User?s Panel
- an important and timely opportunity for the community to review where we
are with the recent UK government investment and determine what's needed in
the future.

 It's free to attend just the *New Science of New Data* symposium or *Software
Sustainability Institute Fellows Programme* launch on Monday 10th, or
the *e-Infrastructure
Forum* on Wednesday 12th (thanks to our sponsors). Full 3-day registration
enables you to attend everything and there's a lot more happening
throughout the event, including an exciting "DevChallenge" hackathon run by
DevCSI, software surgery by SSI and multiple community workshops - plus the
Digital Research 2012 dinner in College and a reception in the
spectacular *Museum
of Natural History*. Please go to
http://digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk/registration to register.

   We're very grateful to everyone who has come together to make this event
possible, including e-Research South, Open Knowledge Foundation, Web
Science, the Digital Social Research programme, our Digital Economy
colleagues and the All Hands Foundation.

 We look forward to seeing you in Oxford 10-12th September to discuss the
state of the art and the shape of the future in Digital Research.
