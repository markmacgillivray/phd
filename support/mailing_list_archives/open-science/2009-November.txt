Background

eCAT is an electronic lab notebook (ELN) developed by Axiope Limited. It
is the first online ELN, the first ELN to be developed in close
collaboration with lab scientists, and the first ELN to be targeted at
researchers in non-commercial institutions. [snip]

Results

[snip] More than 100 individuals and groups worldwide then participated
in the beta testing between September 2008 and June 2009. The generally
positive response is reflected in the following quote about how one lab
is making use of eCAT: "Everyone uses it as an electronic notebook, so
they can compile the diverse collections of data that we generate as
biologists, such as images and spreadsheets. We use to it to take
minutes of meetings. We also use it to manage our common stocks of
antibodies, plasmids and so on. Finally, perhaps the most important
feature for us is the ability to link records, reagents and
experiments."

Conclusions

By developing eCAT in close collaboration with lab scientists, Axiope
has come up with a practical and easy to use product that meets the need
of scientists to manage, store and share data online. eCAT is already
being perceived as a product that labs can continue to use as their data
management and sharing grows in scale and complexity.

Life scientists? information use ? one size does not fit all



Report of research patterns in life sciences reveals that researcher
practices diverge from policies promoted by funders and information
service providers





A report by the British Library and the Research Information Network
(RIN) launched today provides unique insight into how information is
used by researchers across life sciences. Undertaken by the University
of Edinburgh?s Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and
Innovation, and the UK Digital Curation Centre and the University of
Edinburgh?s Information Services, the report concludes that
?one-size-fits-all? information and data sharing policies are not
achieving scientifically productive and cost-efficient information use
in life sciences.



The report, Patterns of Information Use and Exchange: Case Studies of
Researchers in Life Sciences was developed using an innovative
approach to capture the day-to-day patterns of information use in
seven research teams from a wide range of disciplines, from botany to
clinical neuroscience. The study undertaken over 11 months and
involving 56 participants found that there is a significant gap
between how researchers behave and the policies and strategies of
funders and service providers. This suggests that the attempts to
implement such strategies have had only a limited impact. ?Key
findings from the report include:



????????? Researchers use informal and trusted sources of advice from
colleagues, rather than institutional service teams, to help identify
information sources and resources

????????? The use of social networking tools for scientific research
purposes is far more limited than expected

????????? Data and information sharing activities are mainly driven by
needs and benefits perceived as most important by life scientists
rather than ?top-down? policies and strategies

????????? There are marked differences in the patterns of information
use and exchange between research groups active in different areas of
the life sciences, reinforcing the need to avoid standardised policy
approaches



The study used ground-breaking research methods to map information use
in research teams from across the life sciences. This included
specially designed ?information lab books? to chart and monitor
individual researcher?s day-to-day information practices.



The report sets out a number of recommendations to funders,
universities and information service providers on how policy and
services can be more aligned with research practice and help UK life
scientists sustain their position at the forefront of world-class
research.



Commenting on the report, Professor Sir Kenneth Calman, Chair of the
National Cancer Research Institute & Chancellor, University of Glasgow
said: ?This report is a crucial piece of work and allows us to
understand in more detail the role that information and data play in
contemporary research across the life sciences.? Further, it
demonstrates the gaps that exist between policy and practice and it is
with this in mind that funders, universities and information
professionals should take note of this report and draw on its
recommendations to inform their plans in supporting UK life science
research in the future.?



Dr Eric Fevre, a Wellcome Trust Research Career Development Fellow who
participated in the study, commented: "It is fascinating to see mapped
out how we, as life-scientists, use information resources within our
academic networks, but the report also highlights potentially valuable
tools and technologies that we under-use or ignore completely. It
encourages scientists to think formally about their use of information
in research and thereby increase their efficiency in so doing."



Patterns of Information Use and Exchange: Case Studies in Life
Sciences will be launched at a reception at the British Library on
17th November at 6.30pm.

Press Release

Open Science ? the future for research?

As part of JISC?s ?Research 3.0 ? driving the knowledge economy? activity
which launches at the end of November, a new Open Science report released
today trails key research trends that could have far-reaching implications for
science, universities and UK society.

The report written by UKOLN at the University of Bath and the Digital Curation
Centre, identifies open-ness, predictive science based on massive data
volumes and citizen involvement as being important features of tomorrow?s
research practice.

It is hoped that this document will stimulate and contribute to community
discussion in the UK, which is ranked second in the world for its output of
quality research, but also fuel the open science debate on the global stage.

As part of JISC?s data management programme JISC is discussing with UK
research funders and libraries on how best to build on recent initiatives, such
as the HEFCE-funded UK Research Data Service feasibility study, so as to
address the considerable challenges outlined in the Open Science report.

Neil Jacobs, programme manager at JISC, says, ?There are important changes
in the way science exploits the potential of digital technologies. We are not
saying that the these trends go together - they may conflict - but what we
are looking to find out is to what extent they are happening now and what
researchers, librarians and others think their impact will be in the future.

?Where there is widespread access to the web, digital cameras and
computers, then citizens can become active participants in science, for
example collecting data on natural phenomena on a massive scale. ?While this
has happened so far in isolated projects, the potential is now for a more
general shift in public participation in science,? added Neil.

The Open Science report looks at how technologies can support the open
movement to share data, workflows, methods and research outputs. It also
illustrates the vital role librarians could have in supporting these new trends
and the recognised need to build relationships between researchers and
librarians to support the research of the future.

Take part in the Open Science discussions and share your views at
the ?Research 3.0 ? driving the knowledge economy? blog

The views, comments and opinions posted on the blog will shape JISC?s
activities over the next 12 months so events cover areas the research and
education community feel strongly about.
