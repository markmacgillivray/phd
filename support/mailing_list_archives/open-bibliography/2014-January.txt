Subject: [open-bibliography] Adapting the Panton/openbiblio principles
	regarding new version of CC licenses
Message-ID: <CAOtd05GD+koQJovj7xO+X=ccNT7av8wRCASUeVdAU8OzWiLJJg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

as you probably know Creative Commons released version 4.0 of its
license suite in November 2013. One significant change was that the
licenses were made suitable for licensing data in the EU. Like Timothy
Vollmer put it on the OKFN blog:


- The version 4.0 of CC licenses makes all CC licenses suitable for
licensing data, including the EU
- Currently it reads in the openbiblio principles (as well as in the
Panton Principles): "Creative Commons licenses (apart from CC0), GFDL,
GPL, BSD, etc. are NOT  appropriate for data and their use is STRONGLY
discouraged."
- The linked list with OKD-compliant licenses for content and data
already reflects the changes that came with the 4.0 version of CC
licenses, see http://opendefinition.org/licenses/#Data . Thus, the
easiest and probably most sensible option would to just delete this
sentence. (This would also make it easier to adapt the translations

Hello,

my excuses for accidently sending a draft mail to the list. Here now a
less "drafty" version.

As you probably know Creative Commons released version 4.0 of its
license suite in November 2013. One significant change was that the
licenses were made suitable for licensing data in the EU. Like Timothy
Vollmer put it on the OKFN blog:

"Probably the most significant improvement is the expansion in license
scope to include sui generis database rights?those copyright-like
rights that exist in Europe and a few other countries which are
granted to those who exert some effort into compiling a database. The
4.0 licenses (of course, those aligned with the Open Definition) are
now better suited for use by governments and publishers of public
sector information and open data." [1]

Following this change, a change to the Principles of Open
Bibliographic Data as well as to the Panton Principles on which the
openbiblio principles build is necessary. Currently it reads in the
openbiblio principles (as well as in the
Panton Principles): "Creative Commons licenses (apart from CC0), GFDL,
GPL, BSD, etc. are NOT  appropriate for data and their use is STRONGLY
discouraged."

As the linked list with OKD-compliant licenses for content and data
[2] already reflects the changes that came with the 4.0 version of CC
licenses the easiest and probably most sensible option would to just
delete the above
sentence. (This would also make it easier to adapt the translations.)

All the best
Adrian

*Metadata Intersections: Bridging the Archipelago of Cultural Memory*

DC-2014 International Conference and Annual Meeting of DCMI
8-11 October 2014
AT&T Executive Education and Conference Center
   The University of Texas at Austin

*Call for Participation: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2014/cfp
<http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2014/cfp>*

*Researchers, practicing professionals and students* with broad interests
in principled metadata design and best practices have gathered annually
since 1995 under the DCMI banner to exchange ideas, to discover important
common ground, and to work on shared problems. As one of the first broadly
inclusive efforts at crowdsourcing expertise on the Web, the DCMI community
has been a key player in the evolving information environment of the Web of
documents and data.

*DC-2014 CONFERENCE THEME:*
Metadata is fundamental in enabling ubiquitous access to cultural and
scientific resources through galleries, libraries, archives and museums
(GLAM). While fundamental, GLAM traditions in documentation and
organization lead to significant differences in both their languages of
description and domain practices. And yet, the push is on for "radically
open cultural heritage data" that bridges these differences as well as
those across the humanities and the sciences. DC-2014 will explore the role
of metadata in spanning the archipelago of siloed cultural memory in an
emerging context of linked access to data repositories as well as
repositories of cultural artifacts.

*BEYOND THE THEME:*
Submissions of papers, reports, and posters are welcome in all areas of
innovative metadata design and best practices.

*IMPORTANT DATES:*
*Peer-Reviewed Papers, Project Reports & Posters:*
? Submission Deadline: 3 April 2014
? Author Notification: 12 July 2014
? Final Copy: 16 August 2014

*Special & Panel Sessions, Workshops:*
? Submission Deadline: 3 April 2014
? Author Notification: 1 June 2014

*Best Practice Posters & Demonstrations*
? Submission Deadline: 2 June 2014
? Author Notification: 30 June 2014

(All deadlines: Midnight, Pacific Standard Time)

*Program Committee Chairs:*

? William Moen, *School of Library and Information Sciences, University of
North Texas, United States*
? Amy Rushing, *University of Texas at San Antonio, United States*

?????????????????????????

The 10th annual Taxonomy Boot Camp will be held again in Washington DC from
November 4-5 as part of KMWorld.  The call for speakers is now open,
deadline for proposals is March 20.  Proposals for individual sessions,
panels and workshops are all welcome, covering any aspect of
taxonomy/ontology/vocabulary design, management, integration and use.  See
full details at http://www.taxonomybootcamp.com/2014/, or submit your
proposal online at http://www.taxonomybootcamp.com/2014/CallForSpeakers.aspx
.

Taxonomy Boot Camp brings together practitioners and experts in taxonomy,
vendors who have created tools to help manage your taxonomies, and novices
who are starting out in the world of information management.  Two parallel
tracks on the first day provide those new to the field with the nuts and
bolts they need to get up to speed, and expert practitioners with insights
into how other professionals have made their organizations more successful
through better use of taxonomies.  On the second day of the Boot Camp,
everyone shares in case studies, practical sessions on taxonomy tools and
their use, and cutting edge developments in the field.  Don't miss this
unique opportunity to learn about tools and techniques you can use to bring
your information clouds together, and meet the people who can help you be
successful in your efforts.
