Join NISO/DCMI for our joint January webinar

--Webinar: Translating the Library Catalog from MARC into Linked Data: An
Update on the Bibliographic Framework Initiative
--Date: January 23, 2013
--Time: 1:00 - 2:30 p.m. (Eastern Time - UTC 18:00:00) (World Clock:
http://bit.ly/UQtGdU)
--Event webpage: http://www.niso.org/news/events/2013/dcmi/bibframework/

=========================================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR:

In May 2012, the Library of Congress announced a new modeling initiative
focused on reflecting the MARC 21 library standard as a Linked Data model
for the Web, with an initial model to be proposed by the consulting company
Zepheira.  The goal of the initiative is to translate the MARC 21 format to
a Linked Data model while retaining the richness and benefits of existing
data in the historical format.

In this webinar, Eric Miller of Zepheira will report on progress towards
this important goal, starting with an analysis of the translation problem
and concluding with potential migration scenarios for a broad-based
transition from MARC to a new bibliographic framework.

SPEAKER:

Eric Miller is co-founder and president of Zepheira, which provides
solutions for managing information across boundaries of person, group, and
enterprise. Until 2007, Eric led the Semantic Web Initiative for the World
Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT and was one of the key leaders in the
development of the Resource Description Framework and other Semantic Web
technologies.  Prior to his work at W3C, Eric was a Senior Research
Scientist at OCLC Online Computer Library Center, Inc. in Dublin, Ohio,
where he served as the co-founder and Associate Director of the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative.

Registration closes one hour before the webinar begins.

Subject: Inviting community engagement on building a bibliographic roadmap

Good afternoon, NISO community,

Last fall, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation generously awarded the National Information Standards Organization (NISO) with a grant to support an initiative that will develop a community roadmap toward a new bibliographic exchange environment.  This roadmap will help support movement toward a future of bibliographic information exchange ecosystem. The bibliographic roadmap initiative aims to bring together as diverse a set of stakeholders as possible to build agree around on a common development path for bibliographic information exchange.  Using a consensus process, NISO hopes to build agreement about the problems that we face, which are the best available solutions, and work toward coordinating community efforts.  The project is not trying to duplicate efforts already underway, nor is it trying to drive a particular agenda, nor support a single community project.	Through open virtual dialogue and an in-person meeting?again open and publicly accessible?, the initiative will ascertain the necessary elements of a bibliographic standards environment that are implementable, suit our global networked information environment, support data sharing, and are economically viable.

Over the course of the next nine months, NISO will host one face-to-face meeting in the United States and several global webinars, as well as organize at least three working group efforts during the periods between webinars. These meetings will be conducted to explore priorities and coordinate the requirements of key communities including: libraries of all types including national libraries; technologists represented by organizations such as the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI); library system providers; as well as other international standards development organizations. The end result of this work will be a report that will identify exchange points where standards development is needed, and document suggested areas where functionality testing should be performed.  It should help pinpoint at a high level the development priorities and coordination points needed over the next 24-36 months. 

NISO will be hosting an open community teleconference to launch this project on Thursday, January 17 at 9:00 ET (UTC -5:00) and we encourage community involvement in that meeting. The purpose of this call will be to introduce the community to this project, outline our goals, answer any questions and begin to map out planning the project and identify dates and locations for the in-person meeting that the Mellon Foundation has funded.  We expect the call will take about 60 minutes.

Please use the following dial-in: 
  Toll-Free (US & Can) 1-877-375-2160
  Conference ID: 767-11-246#	
 For a list of international dial-in numbers visit: https://ccimeet.tcconline.com/listNumbersByCode.action?confCode=76711246 

More information about the project can be found on the NISO website: http://www.niso.org/topics/tl/BibliographicRoadmap/  We will also record the call and will post the recoding to this page after the event.  You can also find an extract of the proposal describing the project in detail at that page.

If you plan to attend, please send an RSVP to nisohq at niso.org prior to Thursday morning.

We look forward to speaking with many of you on Thursday.

With kindest regards,

Todd Carpenter
Executive Director, NISO

It's of interest to me.  I don't know how they select participants (if at
all). We should probably do this as OKF effort -who is currently the OKFN
staff member for this - is it Joris? We should be reporting progress on
BibJSON, OpenBibliography generally and Bibserver/BibSoup

NISO has invited a group to participate, and I am on that group. There 
are folks from W3C, DC, BL, JISC, OCLC, Zepheira, ex-Talis, etc. But as 
I said in a note to Jim, I don't think they have anyone representing the 
academic community so I can suggest that someone is added for the 
Bibserver/Bibsoup view. The OKF view might also be of interest, so I 
will bring that up as well -- that it's not just the technical aspects 
but also the social and legal ones that matter with bibliographic data.

(NISO hasn't yet set up an email list nor a wiki space for this project, 
although I keep pushing for them to do so, to make the deliberations as 
public as possible. Unfortunately, NISO does not work like W3C or DC, 
with all info in a public space. I have allies, though, who will help 
push for that.)

This NISO project is based on an effort of mine, with a vendor 
collaborator. We wrote an initial grant proposal. We weren't able to get 
a planning grant on our own so it morphed into a NISO grant. My original 
purpose was to make sure that a larger community of interest was 
involved in the future of bibliographic data since it is, by its nature, 
data that is used and shared widely, not just within the library 
community. It has taken over a year to get to this point, though. I hope 
it is not too late.

I put up an update about bibsoup just last week, so if you are looking for
timely information on recent changes and future plans, have a look here:

http://openbiblio.net/2013/01/11/a-revamp-of-bibserver-and-bibsoup/

I would also be happy to represent the academic or developer community if
you are looking for volunteers.

Thanks Karen!

It would obviously be wonderful if we could build on existing work by this
group such as the Principles on Open Bibliographic Data [1].

And also earlier work, such as the response to the Library of Congress that
we drafted with the late Aaron Swartz:

That's too bad.  I didn't realize that you were behind it or I
wouldn't have objected so vociferously.

I see a few problems with this effort:

- NISO is a professional standards secretariat, so they have an
incentive to make the case for new standards and/or organizations
which will hire them convene meetings, write reports, and generally do
overhead type stuff associated with the standards process.  If the
standard is created in an existing group like the W3C, they lose.
Many people will come to the table assuming that they are trying to
create a place for themselves in the ecosystem.

- They intend to collect requirements from a large group of
stakeholders, but they don't have anyone signed up to do anything with
those requirements.

- They claim to be coordinating groups who haven't expressed any
desire to be coordinated -- and, if the LC & W3C wanted to coordinate,
they'd be better of doing it directly themselves instead of through a
zero value-add intermediary

- They're going to spend 12-18 months and who knows how much money to
produce a *report* and nothing more.

Perhaps the documentation and PR doesn't do justice to what is
actually going to happen, but I'd be a lot more impressed if the LC,
DPLA, Google (both Books & Search), OpenLibrary, OCLC and an open
source ILS team or two got together and said we're going to sit down
and figure out how we work together.

I'm in agreement with Tom on this. Bring the practitioners of the future of
open bibliography around the table to develop an open standard, one that
won't be monetized or held behind pay walls (OCLC I'm talking to you)

This being my humble opinion as a librarian...

Mainly that LC has already chosen a direction that does not have input 
from a larger community. By the time there is input from a larger 
community, LC will be in a position to say: we've already decided.

Don't worry - I have some of the same issues that you have of it being a 
NISO project. We tried to get Dublin Core or W3C to host it for many of 
the reasons that you state, but they didn't feel that they could. I'm 
already frustrated...

Xactly. I'm hoping that no actual standards come out of this, but 
perhaps some use cases, and maybe some folks will agree to work together 
on their own.

I don't think you can sign anyone up until you see what the requirements 
will be. But, yes, there is a chance that this will be another "bridge 
to nowhere."

As I said above, W3C opted out of that. I don't know why.

Yep, the usual result of a planning grant. What can I say?

That was the dream. *sigh* But someone had to get the planning grant 
that would pay for the meeting, and granting agencies have strict 
requirements about who they will give money to. It really took over 12 
months to get this far.

I approached a lot of folks, everyone thought it was a good idea and 
that someone else should organize it. If I could have gotten a grant on 
my own I would have done things quite differently. It's a harsh world. :-(

And Europeana. ;-)

Sam, Joris and Sarah (in cc) have been thinking about how we can support
greater transatlantic coordination re: opening up metadata from GLAM
institutions. We have starting thinking about activities/event in this area
for 2013 and it would be great to swap notes on this front.

We also wanted to use this to start connecting open digitisation
initiatives, so we can start to figure out where there are open copies of
public domain works - and what needs to be done [1].

I had been intending to ask whether LC were involved in this work, and how
it related to their bibliographic framework activity.

Great points all! I suppose now is as good a time as ever to mend the
branching of DDC over the past 125+ years. As we continue to seek
international standards for representing the complexity of published works
it should be less ethnocentric and more open. The lack of support from W3C
and Dublin Core isn't doing us any favors either, though the Library Linked
Data Incubator was helpful.

  You mean RDA?  I am hard pressed to image what the committee would do
  to move the direction of that giant slow ship.

  More generally, there has always been the question of a business
  case for the expense of creating and maintaining free bibliographic
  data. Not surprisingly, as far as scholarly data is concerned,
  I find that RePEc gives us the best successful example for a model.
  ADS, DBLP, PubMed, SPIRES are other. Within the realm of this
  type of efforts there would be scope to coordinate. But if you
  bring in monographs, fiction books, ebooks, sound recordings etc
  the scope becomes really wide and the business model unclear.

Hi Tom,   (Is this the same Tom from Wikipedia?)

I'm actually planning an event (small scale, about 40 people) for the 
"main players" (or those who have potential to be) in OpenGLAM in the US 
in March. I do intend on inviting folks from LC, DPLA, OpenLibrary, 
OCLC, etc (Google...I'm not so sure at this point...but, this is based 
on my professional and personal opinions about Google, digitization, 
copyright, etc...so if my "bosses" say we must invite Google, then I'd 
invite someone from Google..but, I've been well burned I'm still nursing 
my wounds :) )

We'll also be inviting some folks from Europe who are key leaders as 
well, so we can have further partnerships transatlantically, as Jonathan 
mentioned, and pull ideas and inspiration from what is happening with 
Europeana, etc, in the US.

I'm working on it :)

-Sarah

Dear all,

I should understand the last bit as kind words, I hope :-)

I'd be curious to hear in which way W3C and DCMI has "opted out", as was said. Is it really about lack of moral support? These organizations, prestigious and useful be they, don't have a lot of resources. The LLD incubator existed because we could share the organization load among three chairs, and then could rely on extraordinary skills and commitment from the members... W3C was extremely supportive from the start, but they just can't commit the resources for all the needed groundwork for every community group.

A similar phenomenon applies for us in Europeana (I hear we've been named yesterday ;-) ). We're certainly interested in this kind of activity, and will try to follow that new NISO one. But our resources are also limited. And we can't commit what I've done for the LLD incubator, every year. We've got other business; and libraries are just one of the communities we aim at serving--besides, it's tough one to engage as they are many, smart and like having good discussions ;-). So, yes, at some moments at least, we'll probably be part of the "it's-a-great-idea-can-someone-else-take-the-lead-please" crowd Karen has refered to.
  
Cheers,

Antoine

No, I'm talking about their "new bibliographic framework" initiative -- 
they are working on a "replacement for MARC". MARC was a 
library-specific format initially to be used to print cards, and wasn't 
intended to interact with non-library data. The new format is being done 
with at least some consciousness that we are in an environment where we 
might need to share data with other communities. Unfortunately, there 
seems to be no investigation of what those other communities have, want, 
or need. Bibliographic data is some of the most widely used data so it 
just makes sense that we'd want it to flow nicely between use cases.

I actually think that we do have a "business case" for free bib data, if 
not more than one. Publishers definitely do, since the data that they 
provide for free advertises their product. Libraries do because they 
share bib data, thus saving themselves a great deal of repetitive 
effort. An in essence, everyone who provides citations or a bibliography 
with their work is giving the world free bib data. We just haven't yet 
done a good job of capturing all of this data together in a useful way.

One thing that we ran into when chatting with DC is that DC is now 
incorporated in Singapore -- and thus is not eligible for US grants. W3C 
is seen as an "international" effort, and granting agencies seem to be 
wary of dipping into something that wide-ranging. They prefer US-based 
organizations with lots of structure behind them. NISO gets grants in 
part because its members are solid corporations and institutions.

Antoine,

I apologize for my frustration. What you and others have done with LLD and
Europeana is incredible. It is unfortunate that the resources aren't there
to be invested, that's partly the fault of us as the public. And I should
add that the EU has demonstrated a stronger commitment to these issues than
our US counterparts/organizations, at the least monetarily and to this
point in time.

Dan Brickley (Google/schema.org) has said previously (I'll have to find the
reference) that Google is very interested in moving forward with libraries
on metadata/semantic web solutions but hasn't received much invested
interest in collaborating on such topics. I don't know, but maybe he was
referring to OCLC, LOC, and others. I'm primarily concerned with making
sure the web ontologists, et al, and librarians continue to merge efforts
so as to avoid parallel solutions that don't crosswalk. Though, again, I
should mention my experience in the standards process is not as deep as
your own or on par with someone like Karen Coyle either. ;-)

Thank you for letting me share my thoughts.

And unfortunately some publishers don't as they see bibdata as something
they possess and to be controlled and sold. Do you have any concrete
evidence that publishers want to make their bib data Open?  If publishers
seriously wanted free bib data then maybe they would have reacted more
positively to our Open Bibliographic principles.

I actually suspect that publishers do not want open bibdata. They want
Google to index it for them. If Elsevier tell you they are happy to give
PeterMR their bib data for his own unrestricted use I'd be amazed.

Scholars create bibliographies in scholarly publication and if these
"belong" to closed publishers they claim the copyright on them.

I agree. Some of us are trying, with little/no funding, to scrape the
public web and to build shared resources. But it is often a long slog to
create such bottom-up data.  And maybe this is something that libraries
could put some effort into.

Hi Peter,

Some publishers have said they are seriously thinking about making their bibliographic data open, and are making business cases to do so.

We'll see how this pans out...

Thanks Rachel,
This is very good news and JISC is a very important catalyst. JISC can make
things happen that individuals can't.

As soon this happens please let us know and we can put it under Bibserver
and apply the (JISC-supported) Principles of Open Bibliography.

I shall have a celebratory (small) drink. and a laregr one when something
is actually announced.

To the extent that the law determines a copyright interest exists, a CC0 license applies ...The DPLA asserts no new rights over metadata at the DPLA level".

  So do I. As long as the biggest one, Elsevier, runs a business of
  selling metadata through Scopus, why would they give that data away?
  Actually they do give some to RePEc but I am told we are the only
  ones they give any of their metadata to and it does not contain
  abstracts. This data still has commercial value.  Case in point: the
  CEO of a company in the scholarly communications field confided to
  me that his company spends a lot of money for metadata from a
  medium-sized society publisher.

> They want Google to index it for them.

  They don't have the resources. They spend all their resource on
  toll-gated publishers. Thus they are outsourcing themselves to
  death.

Imagine if 100 (and possibly 1000) publishers all had their search engines?
It would be almost as useless as institutional repositories. No, they want
a one-stop shop. Maybe Elsevier would like that role, but not - say - the
Chemical Society of Japan. I *can* see the value of domain-specific
repositories - if they add value beyond GoogleText. e.g. searching for data
and equations.

They don't have the courage. The are the managers of huge amounts of money
but they have no control. They're scared of academics, they're scared of
publishers. I think you're right - libraries will be replaced by
outsourcing and that - unless we can take control - will be *awful*.

Oh gosh, that site is so old. If the information there works for you, great.
But I haven't updated it in over 5 years. I do know that McGraw-Hill is
still quite good about providing their ONIX records, and I remain on their
mailing list because I've been too lazy to remove myself. It would be great
if someone took upon themselves to create a directory of such record feeds,
but I'm afraid that person can no longer be me.

Sorry, Roy. Just wanted some examples of publishers making their ONIX 
data openly available. I'll look for a better example.

May I suggest a different strategy?

1. Identify publishers that provide an ONIX data feed.
2. Download their current file and process it.

I?d rather you didn?t hack/crawl my server. If nothing else, if you were
desperate to get data that is now nearly 6 years old, allow me to tar the
data files and drop them somewhere.

Right, the folks giving away their metadata (because it helps sales) are 
generally the book publishers. Journal publication has an entirely 
different economic model because it' isn't a one-time sale but a 
subscription, and I haven't found a publisher-provided metadata for 
journal publications (which would cover the publication, not its 
contents). If journal publishers would get away from the serial view and 
publish and sell articles as monographs, we might see a major change in 
their view of metadata. In fact, the whole journal format is beginning 
to look old-fashioned to me as a product category.

I don't know yet about music publishers -- I don't think they yet have a 
standard metadata format.

I must confess when I first saw the posts about publishers giving metadata
away, I initially read that as referencing monograph/book publishers since
these are likely to see the metadata as purely advertising/marketing
material to the like of Amazon et al. and didn't initially think of serials.

I think there may also be different economic models in the music publishing
world as well - when you say "music publishers" are you talking about
publishers of music scores or publishers of musical performances (e.g.
audio/video)?

I was thinking of sound recordings, since, AFAIK, the market for scores 
is pretty much a niche market. Much of the impetus for creating and 
spreading metadata has been online sales sites like Amazon, and perhaps 
iTunes (although I do not know where the latter gets its metadata from). 
You can easily find studies addressed to the publishing industry about 
metadata and sales -- although, in fact, these aren't as conclusive as 
one might hope.

Re: serials metadata. 

CrossRef serves up metadata (RDF, and BibTex) via content negotiation. It's not directly from the publishers, but it is submitted by them as a part of the DOI registration process. 

I'm not sure if there is clear licensing or not.

Crossref are also working on providing bibJSON bib metadata by content
negotiation. From what I have seen, what it provides is only whatever the
publishers have provided and in a lot of cases it is unfortunately not very
useful - for example, not including title and authors or any unique ID. The
data that is supplied meets the definition of open bibliographic metadata
as per the open biblio principles. But I don't know if license is
explicitly stated anywhere.

What about Musicbrainz for music metadata? It's crowdsourced but quite
extensive and is linked data with an API/RDF endpoint.

  I was not aware of this. Can you say something more about this?
  Presumably, this requires you to know the DOI?

  Do you have an example? You mean there are papers where the HTML
  returned in a query that resolves a  DOI to a publisher's pages 
  suggests that the item described by the DOI has a title but 
  the DOI metadat in RDIF or BibTex returned does not? How does
  that compare to the item metadata in SIGG (if and when you find
  it in SIGG, which itself is a hit and miss). I have written 
  a rebot to query SIGG from AuthorClaim claimed items. 
  I found the metadata in reasonable shape, but sometimes with hideous
  charset issues, with some fields encoded in latin-1, others in utf-8.
  Absence of titles in these record means the items does not have one. 

  SIGG is here

http://labs.crossref.org/site/crossref_metadata_search.html

  my engine is at 

http://sigg.openlib.org

  The records are exposed through the OKFN sponsored 3lib project.

ftp://ftp.3lib.org/amf/3lib/crossref/

  Oops, this page suggests no updates since October, I have
  to check what happened there.

  ok that's DOI data. It's cumbersome to deal with, from my 
  experience. But what you have here is data you resolve when
  you know a DOI. But you never get a list of DOIs fulfilling
  a certain criteria. This is what sigg comes in, but as its
  home page suggests

  In the AuthorClaim use case, I want to know more about 
  documents claimed by authors. I create automated queries
  to sigg and submit them. So, if the paper has

Title: foo with bar
Author: Krichel
Auhtor: Yakovenko

  I can query sigg with "Krichel foo", "Yakovenko bar" etc.  That's
  what my software does. It is supposed to run in a self-contained
  fashion on the set of AuthorClaim data, using accessed and refused
  paper metadata. It has heavily home-grown method to find what terms
  to put into the query.

Right. When I first saw this, I was hopeful that the author URI's (e.g.
http://id.crossref.org/contributor/e-m-hansen-2iohzxipawvj7) would resolve
to something. They don't--and I can't find any examples of two items by the
same author sharing the same creator URI. As implemented, these would as
well be blank nodes.

It's possible the Linked Data approach will pay off as ORCID (for example)
develops. For now, it's really only useful if you already know which items
you want data for and have or can easily get DOIs for them.

  ORCID is not open data, so it will not change much of anything.
  It will probably make things worse.

ORCID IS open data, see http://about.orcid.org/about/what-is-orcid

Quote:
"ORCID makes its code available under an open source license, and will
post an annual public data file under a CCO waiver for free download."

I guess, what you get via the API is also CC0.

  An "annual public file" but with what data? In any case annual is
  not sufficient to build a service.

  I think an earlier version of this said it would be the data 
  contributed by registrants (users), but they have taken that
  out just to say there will be annual data.

Blogged about it on OpenGLAM. This is a great next step in order to
facilitate collaborations with Europeana.

They *should* be able to differentiate between licences. I think they don't
regard it as high priority.

At the risk of flooding almost all OKF lists I have added Open
Bibliography. Mark MacGillivray and others have tools for starting to
interrogate documents and their metadata about licences. Early days. But if
DOAJ don't do it, we shall have to use machines to do it.

Being able to search via license is on my wish list for future for DOAJ but yes, its not the highest current priority which is to stabilise the current system, catch up with backlog and start to tackle journal/publisher validation/quality control.

Also worth noting that this would only ever provide the default license at the journal level. Relatively few journals are absolutely consistent in the licenses they use, although the default is a good first approximation.

FWIW I did some analysis of the set of licenses within the Creative Commons subset of DOAJ and CC BY-SA isn't very common. CC BY-NC is more common. The figures are 174 (SA), 1174(BY), 486(NC) from my analysis. Many of these journals don't publish all that much so by articles there's much more CC BY content as this is the default for the larger OA publishers.

Cheers

Cameron

DOAJ does have a slot in its metadata for licences: for example, if
you search for "acta":
http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=findJournals&uiLanguage=en&hybrid=&query=acta
27 of the 100 journals listed in the first page of results list the licence.

Obviously, though, that's not nearly enough. From my perspective two
top priorities for DOAJ now that it's up and running again are:

1. Populate the Licence field for *all* journals. Obviously not all
journals have an explicit statement of licence, but even for such
journals it's much better that the DOAJ entry clearly state
"unspecified" rather than no say anything.

2. Extend the search form to allow narrowing by licence (and other
criteria, I guess, but this is the big one).

Serials (aka journals) can have long lives, and applying a license to 
the full life of the serial may not be feasible. Also, in some cases 
individual articles have different IP rights attached (e.g. if it 
reports on an NIH sponsored grant, or is a US federal document in the 
public domain). So just a caution that this may become a multi-level and 
time-coded datum as more information is gathered.

With an army of machines, we are unstoppable!

They sent another reply saying that they would forward the request to the
director to see what could be done.

I also updated the Wikipedia page to start filling in some of the data
doing the research by hand (not actually that hard). Still waiting for
other people to jump in and commit some time to this!

Subject: [open-bibliography] BIS open access inquiry
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEwMcmnK2S9QUjOEdVYyfppU-hahV69mXgN3MvqPeK8tOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear lists,


Following-on the House of Lords
inquiry<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/science-and-technology-committee/news/open-access/>,
there is also a Business, Innovation and Skills Committee inquiry into the
new RCUK open access mandate. A fair few of the 70 or so written evidence
submissions<http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/science-technology/Openaccess/OpenAccessevidence.pdf>
 to the House of Lords inquiry were quite misguided in my opinion and few
were from active researchers like myself.

I was wondering therefore if you would perhaps consider submitting some
written evidence to the BIS inquiry, further details
here<http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/business-innovation-and-skills/news/committee-announces-an-inquiry-into-open-access/>
.

The Committee will consider a range of topics including:

   - The Government?s acceptance of the recommendations of the Finch Group
   Report ?Accessibility, sustainability, excellence: how to expand access to
   research publications?, including its preference for the ?gold? over the
   ?green? open access model;
   - Rights of use and re-use in relation to open access research
   publications, including the implications of Creative Commons ?CC-BY?
   licences;
   - The costs of article processing charges (APCs) and the implications
   for research funding and for the taxpayer; and
   - The level of ?gold? open access uptake in the rest of the world versus
   the UK, and the ability of UK higher education institutions to remain
   competitive.

Written evidence should be sent to the Committee, as an MS Word document,
by e-mail to biscommem at parliament.uk.
The deadline for BIS submissions is 7 February 2013.

I am particularly concerned about the confusion in many recent blog posts
in certain quarters over what Creative Commons licences actually do. Some
have been attempting to portray the CC Attribution licence (CC BY)  as
against 'author rights' or against 'academic freedom'. It would be good to
make clear the benefits of this, perhaps even in terms of economics.


This is a rare opportunity for for our voices to be heard. We should not
waste this opportunity. Academic publishers will almost certainly be
submitting their viewpoints and interests, so we need to make sure our
interests are represented too.


Best,

Ross

I am giving a tutorial/workshop in about 18 hours on creating a scientific
knowledgebase. I was thinking of getting each participant to create 1
simple bibliographic record by cutting and pasting from the Literature and
then aggregating them.

* is bibserver working? If not are there any existing examples of
Bibserver/Bibsoup we can show?
* can we upload individual records sequentially or do we have to bundle
them.
* they will probably cut and paste into an EtherPad - what is the best
format? BibJSON?
* is any Bibserver expert around at ca 0900 AU == 2200 UTC 2013-01-31 and
could be active on Etherpad?
* am I completely mad?

I've merged it back to Wikipedia mainspace; now it lives at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open-access_journals

It's quite easy to add entries now, as there's a template where you
just fill in the details for each journal, such as license, fee, etc.
If you just have a few minutes, add the info for a journal or two!

Thanks so much for putting in all that work! I hope more people start
contributing. I'll start linking to the article in more places.

I just realized a more complicated issue to represent is when there are
both free and non-free licenses used. This could apply to hybrid OA
journals, or even full OA journals. It's easy enough to add an option for
"Mixed {{Yes-No}}" but it would be difficult to explain the specifics in
that small field. Thoughts?

Dear Peter Murray-Rust,

I'm very interested to follow your tutorial. Do you have a live link,
please?

I believe BibJSON is one of the possible futures as long as nonSql
databases catch on.

And, no, you are not mad! Can't wait for the outcome of your tutorial if no
live.

Thnak you,

http://bibsoup.net

is currently up and running.

People can create accounts and manually create records (fairly easy,
requires doing in JSON if complex), or do them over the API (harder).
Alternatively yes would be a good idea to do in an etherpad using bibjson,
the description of which is here:

http://bibjson.org

I cannot be around at the time requested, but can aggregate any records you
put into an etherpad up into bibsoup for you after the event.

Slides 8/9/10 and 18 are particularly relevant.  We need to convert the
(very good) IUCr HTML/DublinCore metadata into BibJSON. Should be about a
10 - line program. I'll probably hack something in Java but Pythonistas or
anyone else are welcome to help.

The goal is something like: "I read a paper, I capture the bibliography and
annotate it and save it for the world". I comment on it.Bit like what
Connotea (dead) did or Mendeley (proprietary) does.

They will.

The madness was only the timescale. If we can create something in the next
2-3 days that would be wonderful as I can present on Monday (AU time)

Hand editing JSON seems like pretty much the last thing you'd want people
to do if you're trying to entice them with frictionless collaboration.

Why not create the records in tool with proper editing support like Zotero
or Mendeley (or even a Google Spreadsheet) and then convert them later?

"Sorry, only 16 people are allowed to edit a single pad at the same time in
the free version of EtherPad.

Please see our pricing plans for information about having more than 16
collaborators."

Better yet, why not just have them download the preformatted citations.
 They're available in all popular bib formats:
 BIBTeX
EndNote
RefMan
Refer
Medline
CIF
SGML
Plain Text

e.g. http://scripts.iucr.org/cgi-bin/biblio_page?hb7009

either that or use a bookmarklet to extract the data from the HTML
