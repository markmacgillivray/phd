Hello - sorry if i've missed this in the digest, but i just saw on
"Twitter" that OCLC is releasing 1M bibliographic records as Linked
Data using the ODbL license.

This came from a tweet from David Weinberger who is attending the current LOD-LAM conference in SF - apparently Roy Tennant stated this as part of a v short (2 minute) talk - see http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2011/06/02/oclc-to-release-1-million-book-records/ from David.

The thread starts
http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2011-May/000983.html
and basically it's not as good as it seems.  ODbL but still restrictive
usage policy, AIUI.

Hope that helps

These may be part of the same story, but it isn't clear to me - according to Weinberger, Roy Tennant made a specific statement about OCLC releasing " the bibliographic info about the top million most popular books" in linked data format. This seems like a different initiative to the one previously discussed which was about OCLC enabling member libraries to release data.

At the LOD-LAM conference, Roy Tennant announced that OCLC will be
releasing the bib records for the most popular one million books under
an odb license. He made this announcement as part of a talk about
OCLC's interest in linked data, in a lightning round of two-minute
presentations. That is literally all that he said about the release.

I and a couple of other attendees spoke with him immediately
afterwards about this:

- He does not know when this will occur.

- "Most popular" = held by the most libraries

- I asked if it was going to be an attribution license, and he did not
know. I asked if there were going to be further stipulations on top of
the license, and he did not know. In fact, he was puzzled by the
concept.

- He was not sure if they'd be releasing the entire MARC records for
the works, or just the most salient data.

I don't believe he was being cagey. I think he was honestly telling us
what he knew.

Dear all,

in the context of our Planetary social semantic environment for 
scientific, technical, and mathematical documents 
(http://trac.mathweb.org/planetary), we needed a SKOS implementation of 
the ACM Computing Classification System 
(http://www.acm.org/about/class/ccs98-html).  This is now public at its 
namespace URI

http://oaff.info/ontology/acm-ccs#

... and has been validated with the poolparty SKOS consistency checker 
(http://demo.semantic-web.at:8080/SkosServices/check -- thanks for 
providing that!).  For now it's just one static RDF/XML file, but we 
will soon also serve it through a SPARQL endpoint.  Let me know what you 
need, and we might be able to reprioritize these things.  I just thought 
it makes sense to already announce it now, as there is so much redundant 
work done on this due to not being aware of existing implementations.

Note that we have not yet considered copyright issues -- but at least 
preserved the original ACM copyright statement, which permits "personal 
or classroom use".  That's probably not enough for reasonable Linked 
Data applications.  I would be glad if someone familiar with the subject 
could point out what to do.  What did previous publishers of RDF 
versions of the ACM CCS do?

Some technical notes:
* We started with the RKB Explorer RDFS implementation of the ACM CCS 
(which used rdfs:subClassOf, see 
http://acm.rkbexplorer.com/ontologies/acm#)
* Besides the pure concept hierarchy, we (manually) added further 
information from the original HTML source:
  * examples for certain concepts (skos:example)
  * cross-references to related concepts (skos:related)
  * notes on deprecated concepts (skos:historyNote)

While not having verified it formally, we are 99.9% sure that our 
implementation completely covers the ACM CCS.

BTW, to see how _we_ are using this, I have, for now, to point you to 
something similar: We serve the content of the PlanetMath.org 
encyclopedia through our system and enable by-topic navigation powered 
by a SKOS implementation of the MSC (Mathematical Subject 
Classification): see 
http://trac.mathweb.org/planetary/wiki/Demo_PlanetMath for a description 
and http://alpha.planetmath.org/article/msc for the system.  The 
association of PlanetMath articles to their MSC classes is made by 
translating the LaTeX sources of the articles, which have a custom MSC 
metadata macro, to XHTML+RDFa, using dct:subject.  Soon there will be a 
similar navigation through arXiv.org articles served via our system 
(http://trac.mathweb.org/planetary/wiki/Demo_arXiv), as well as our own 
"dog-fooded" computer science lecture notes 
(http://trac.mathweb.org/planetary/wiki/Demo_PlanetBox).  Note that 
arXiv articles may have both MSC and ACM classifications, so aligning 
those two SKOS concept schemes is also planned.

Note that our MSC SKOS implementation is a preliminary and unofficial 
one (and therefore not yet available under a stable URI).  It is 
incomplete and just good enough to drive the Planetary navigation.  In 
collaboration with the AMS, the maintainer of the MSC, we are working on 
a complete and official SKOS reference implementation, obtained by 
translating the original plain-TeX sources to RDF, which will soon be 
available from http://www.msc2010.org.

Cheers,

Christoph

Why is "Sign in with your Google Account" interesting?

Open the document: get it away from google!

OK, sorry for my confusion.  I wish OCLC would do one thing right
before doing two similar things confusingly almost-right ;-)

OK, I thought that either it was yours, or it was published and could
be reproduced here as fair dealing for the purposes of news reporting,
critique or commentary.

Hard to say if anyone knows anything about something we can't see.

A 4 star classification-scheme sounds like a bad idea, rewarding people
for things which aren't quite open enough, like CC-ND licences still let
people claim that they are part of the creative commons, even though a
fenced look-but-don't-touch area isn't really part of a commons.

The document was created during the LOD-LAM (http://lod-lam.net)  
meeting in San Francisco last week. I could export it, but it's being  
discussed and commented on using the Google Docs comments, and that is  
probably the most interesting part. It is similar to the Open Data  
done by JISC/RL-UK, but simpler. The four stars are: CC-0, CC-BY,  
CC-BY-SA and an added version of CC-BY that can take a particular  
attribution license.

This is my main criticism of CC - they are a copyright promotion

OKF would do well to remember this when talking about open licenses -
in an ideal world we wouldn't need them, but since we don't live in an

In law, licenses formalize an agreement. Since we can't get formal  
agreements (generally) in our massive online communication, I see CC  
and other online licenses mainly as a way to INFORM users of our  
desires. When I see a CC license I immediately know that this is  
someone who wants their stuff used; someone who isn't going to sue me  
if I quote them heavily or use their materials in a classroom; that  
they aren't going to pull a "disney". It is easier for me as a user of  
materials to have this information than to NOT have it. If there is no  
license, then I have to assume that all of the restrictions of the  
copyright law apply, and that there is very little that I can safely  
do with the material.

I see licenses as a great improvement over no licenses, since the  
latter automatically puts the materials into the copyright law  
context, whether the creators intend that or not.

Note that the "CC people" do indeed see copyright law as flawed, and  
in fact Lessig has tried (and I think now given up) to reform  
copyright law. CC was developed as a way to keep copyright law from  
restricting use of the net.

implied threats against libraries that release their own data under a

Roy just walked back from his announcement during the two-minute "Dork
Shorts" session at LOD-LAM. In a comment to my blog post about it, he
writes:

"I also mentioned a project to configure the bibliographic records for
the one million most-widely held books in WorldCat. Given the brevity
of the ?dork short? time, I want to be more specific about exactly
where that experiment stands.

"This is a project that is still being formed. The intent of the
project is to investigate how to best release bibliographic data as
linked data that will provide an opportunity for us to get feedback
from other practitioners about how well we?ve done it and how useful
it might be. A part of this project will include considering the
policy and licensing issues. There?s not yet a firm timetable, but as
that is determined it will be shared with the community. We?re
encouraged by the enthusiastic response folks have shown in what we?re
doing. It will help influence the shape of what we ultimately do."

Just to follow up on this, as Karen says, this originated from the
LOD-LAM conference in San Francisco. I don't have enough domain
specific knowledge about how useful this would be for cultural
heritage organisations (what needs it is addressing, etc) - but I'm
pleased to see that it looks like all 4 options are compliant with
OpenDefinition.org.

For anyone who uses Google Docs, there is now a conversation in the
comments thread which has emerged (and which might be of interest to
folks here). For anyone who doesn't use Google Docs, there is now a
copy of the document here:

http://lod-lam.net/summit/2011/06/06/proposed-a-4-star-classification-scheme-for-linked-open-cultural-metadata/

And a response here:

http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2011/06/06/peter-suber-on-the-4-star-openness-rating/

I will try and ping a few people to see if we can also get a guest
blog about this for the OKF Blog!

All the best,

Jonathan

Hello,

as Jonathan says, the draft classification scheme is now published at
the LOD-LAM blog and can be commented and discussed there:
http://lod-lam.net/summit/2011/06/06/proposed-a-4-star-classification-scheme-for-linked-open-cultural-metadata/

I took part in creating the document at the LOD-LAM summit and we had
some interesting discussions around it.
I myself have problems with it as it doesn't explicitely say that we
are talking about _collections_ of metadata. In fact, it isn't said at
all what "licensing metadata" means, i.e. where to attach the license.
This is problematic, because if someone only licenses individual
records, the whole collection could nonetheless be subject to
intellectual property rights...

Especially, this isn't good in combination with another limitation: The open
definition is only partly supported by the document. The requirement
that a work should be made available as a whole isn't supported.

I'll contribute more on this the next days if I get the time...

All the best
Adrian

Hello,

the 12th virtual meeting of the OKFN working group on open
bibliographic data is supposed to be today at 15:00 GMT. I won't be
able to host the skype call today and to moderate the meeting but
might join in later.

It would be nice if someone else could host & moderate the call today. Anyone?

Here are the local times for the meeting:

http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=12th+Virtual+Meeting+of+the+OKFN+Openbiblio+Group&iso=20110607T17&p1=311&ah=1

And this is the etherpad I created:

http://okfnpad.org/12th-open-bibliography-meeting

I would be happy if the meeting could take place anyway without my engagement...

All the best
Adrian

Hi Adrian,

I will cover the meeting this afternoon if you like. Do you have an
idea of who is attending - who I should call up? Or shall I just see
who is in the IRC at 1600 UK time?

Also, I will cross-post the blog.okfn.org article about discovery.

Thanks for the summary.  Mildly concerned that "an added version of
CC-BY" may mean licence proliferation; pretty disappointed that
this is on Google Docs meaning that people who care about service
provider openness are excluded from most of the discussion.

Adrian, I agree with your un-ease about records and collections and  
will add to that... because linked data is about individual  
statements, not records. It is even more difficult to imagine adding a  
license to a single statement that says:

"As You Like It" "was written by" "William Shakespeare"

There have been skype issues today affecting users in Europe. I can
login to skype now, but cannot see anyone else as logged in. I am
therefore unsure if we will manage a meeting today. I am logged into
the OKF irc channel just now though, please sign in there. see

Subject: [open-bibliography] rdf-json and json-ld serialisers and parsers
Message-ID: <20110616210634.GP42832@styx.org>

I've just added a preliminary version of the (updated) rdf-json and
json-ld serialisers and parsers to rdfextras.

The rdf-json bits were originally written by Rob Sanderson and updated
for compatibility with rdflib 3 by Richard Jones.

The json-ld bits were written by Richard Jones in the context of his
work as part of the JISC Open Bibliography project.

I made some minor adjustments, naming of files for compatibility with
the new conventions (e.g. lowercase) and plugin registration in
setup.py.

These are lacking in unit tests at the moment - if there's time left
in jiscobib for Richard to do this it would be great - but I thought
better to get them out in a reusable form rather than languish buried
in the openbiblio codebase.

Cheers,
-w

Subject: [open-bibliography] SWIB11 deadline extended to June 30th (Semantic
 Web in Libraries)
Message-ID: <4DFB626F020000140003FF81@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

Due to several requests the submission deadline to the third conference "Semantic Web in Libraries" (SWIB), 28.-30.11.2011 in Hamburg has been extended to June, 30th 2011. 
 
Here, once again, the call for proposals:
 
After the success of the "Semantic Web in Libraries" (SWIB) events in
2009 and 2010, the SWIB11 will take place in Hamburg from 28 to 30
November 2011. The conference will again be organised by the North
Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz), Cologne, and the
German National Library of Economics - Leibniz Information Centre for
Economics (ZBW), Kiel and Hamburg.
 
A rising number of actors in librarianship and its related fields are
experimenting with Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open Data
(LOD). The LOD cloud as a whole grew by 300% in 2010, whereas the
amount of data relevant for libraries grew by nearly 1000%. The W3C
has created a "Linked Library Data" group to observe this development,
whose first report is due to be published in August. The "Semantic Web
Special Interest Group" established by IFLA shows that this topic has
shown up on their radar as well. At the same time, the principles and
workflows of traditional scientific communication and publication are
under scrutiny with a view to a consistently web-based data and
service infrastructure comprising the entire research and publication
process. Concepts like "nano-publications", "Semantic Publishing",
"Open Data", "Enhanced Publications" or "Research Objects" mark the
re-orientation of academic work, away from monolithic, comparatively
unflexible and barely interlinked reference points towards a
distributed, comparatively granular data infrastructure which is
continuously accessible to researchers and into which their
contributions recognizably return.
 
These are the questions and topics which we would like to discuss with
you at the conference:
 
* How do I find my way around the LOD cloud and how do I achieve
  maximum visibility for my assets?
* How do we produce useful links to and between newly published
  datasets?
* Where do we find best practice examples for LOD-based applications
  which show the added value created by linking assets, in particular
  domain-overlapping assets?
* What are the trends in scholarly communication? What are the
  consequences of the transformation of traditional research and
  publication processes for libraries and what are the opportunities
  Linked Open Data can offer here?
* Library Authority Files and their potential as LOD for library
  applications or research information systems
* What could or should a future Linked Open Data infrastructure look
  like? Are there trends to adapt library applications or research
  environments to the Semantic Web and to support their users in RDF
  publishing?
* Open licences as a prerequisite for LOD-based infrastructures
* What kind of support is to be expected from W3C, international and
  national bodies for future development?
 
These are our topics for SWIB11. Do you have an interesting project or
research topic that should be presented at the conference? We would
like to receive suggestions and proposals for contributions (with a
brief abstract, no more than one page) until 20 June 2011. The
conference will be held in German, but contributions in English are
welcome. Please send them electronically to:

Hi all,

I just caught up with Mark Macgillivray who heads up several of the
OKF's bibliographic data projects. We spoke about how to increase
synergies between the OKF's open bibliographic data related stuff and
its public domain related stuff. There are some notes on this here:

http://jwyg.okfn.org/2011/06/21/how-do-okf-activities-on-open-bibliographic-data-and-the-public-domain-fit-together/

Thought this might be of interest. More on this soon!

All the best,

Message-ID: <BANLkTik-fcv8DozFecU7EPwAN+sPugSWJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Ex Libris has formed an "Expert Advisory Group for Open Data in the
Alma Library Management Service", see http://bit.ly/jfPKDj

Karen, can you provide some more information about this? It doesn't
seem to be focused on legal openness. Also I find this document quite
inconsistent. A phrase like the Alma Community zone being "a catalog
of bibliographic records shared by all libraries that are using the
Alma library management service" does sound more like an exclusive
club than an open database to me. Alongside Karen's quote this is a
bit strange.

Best
Adrian

The word "Open" is often used in  ways that are inconsistent with the OKD. I
remember a vendor presenting their "Open API" at a JISC meeting. I
questioned them and it appeared that the "Open API" was:
* confidential information
* could not be disclosed by purchasers

The best synonym I came up with was "confidential documentation for our
software"

"Open" may simply mean that there is a consortium involved.

This is why the OKD is so important. Without its simple precision we
flounder in meaningless dialogue.

I *guess* the reason ExLibris has formed this group is because the issue might be a bit vague and confusing to them as well. ExLibris highest priority is to be able to sell Alma, not to promote openness, which means that they will need to look at the issue from many different angles. Obviously they need to look at the possibilities for handling different licenses within the Alma Community zone. There will be lots of OCLC libraries in Alma, and not allowing WorldCat data in there would be a bad business strategy for ExLibris.

I don't think the Alma Community zone will revolutionize the bibliographic ecosystem. What is interesting about it is that it is an obvious competitor to WorldCat, and as such it might raise a lot of interesting questions regarding different practices around licensing etc.

ExLibris are not against open bibliographic data, but their main priority is to be able to sell their new system. Which is fine by me. It is we, libraries and others, that need to tell our vendors that open means open. Hopefully a vendor such as ExLibris (or anyone else) will use (true) openness to gain competitive advantage.

Open bibliographic data will lower the total global cost of cataloguing, but this also, however, implies lower profit margins for vendors.

  RePEc are supposed to furnish data to this effort. I was not

  Yup, that's why the composition is more one of customers
  rather than providers of data.

At least some of the members of the exLibris group  read this list. I would
urge them to make sure that the word Open was used consistently with the
OKD. There are several conditions:

* any data should be Open according to the Open Bibliographic Principles
* any NECESSARY software should be Open. (i.e there should be a reasonable
way that people can manipulate the data independently of the vendors system)
or the data should be reasonably usable without software.
* any specifications should be Open.
* any services offered to the world should meet the Open Service Definition.

I have no knowledge of the system or its purpose and it may be that it
brings new approaches to real Openness. I will be particularly concerned
with the rights of the data and the format of the data (specifcations). I
would be concerned if the format was a new properietary one and even more
concerned if there were restrictions on access to the specification and its
use outside this project.

We are currently writing up the Open Bibliography paper arising out of
JiscOpenBIB, Bibliographica etc. and are proposing a common Open format
BibJSON. This is very recent, but it would be a good time for the exLibris
group to consider an Open approach to bibliographic formats. If, of course,
that is what they have done it will be useful.

Hi all,

We're very pleased to announce that we're going to be starting a
series of regular meetups for people interested in open data, open
content, and all things open in London. The Centre for Creative
Collaboration has partnered with the Open Knowledge Foundation to let
us use their fantastic space!

More information about the kind of thing we'll be up to is at:

http://jwyg.okfn.org/2011/06/10/proposal-open-knowledge-london/

For anyone interested in participating, please join the
ok-london-announce list (which I think we should rename to just
ok-london!):

http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ok-london-announce

Please help us to spread the word! The first meeting will probably be
in mid-July.

All the best,

Jonathan

Actually, I know very little about it myself at this point, but I will  
provide info when I get it. My goal is to push toward openness of the  
data, and I believe that is also the goal of Ex Libris. As a company,  
they cannot do anything about "legal" openness, they can only enter  
into a contract with their users about the data they manage. Making  
the bibliographic data in their system open is undoubtedly related to  
a marketing advantage, but having a major vendor take up the question,  
with openness as a goal, is a good thing.

Hi all,

I think this is a good think because the open data movement can win. 

First a short look on the situation. Exlibris is mainly a library system vendor and don't own library data (okay primo central is something different but its not mainly about metadata) What Exlibris can do is make it on the technology level very easy to provide linked data and downloadable data dumps. 

If this technology based questions are part of the group discussion we can very happy because we have less to focus on the how (technology) question and can focus on the license issue. But the license decision has to be taken on the local level. 

But certainly it can also happen was Adrian is pointing out that the talk only about openness in there own eco system. But there is must be made totally clear (if they came out with marketing for that) and this is not real open data. 

It would be nice if they can realize the openness in there own system via using open licenses. 

The outcome don't has to be perfect but the discussion is step forward. Looking forward to see where the discussion is going

Just to be boringly clear.

They may or may not make data more easily accessible and more widely
distributed and this may be a good thing. It's the use of the term "Open
Data" that is the point. "Open" has often been used as a marketing slogan,
like "healthy" or "green". If this term is used, and if this is the goal of
the advisory group then nothing less than full Open Data (OKD-compliant)
including the format is acceptable. Adopting this stance at the beginning of
the project could be useful - aiming for something less is no value for Open
Data.

       W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group
                 CALL FOR PUBLIC COMMENT

The W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group 
(http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/)
has been chartered from May 2010 through August 2011 to prepare a series of 
reports
on the existing and potential use of Linked Data technology for publishing
library data. The group is currently preparing:

--  A report
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/wiki/DraftReportWithTransclusion
which consists of
   "Benefits"
   "Vocabularies and Datasets"
   "Relevant Technologies"
   "Implementation challenges"
   "Recommendations"

-- "Use Cases", a survey report describing existing projects
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/wiki/UseCaseReport
  
-- "Vocabularies and Datasets", a survey report
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/wiki/Vocabulary_and_Dataset

We (LLD XG) invite comments from interested members of the public.

Feedback can sent as comments to individual sections posted on our dedicated 
blog
http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/w3clld/
or by email to a public mailing list
(public-lld at w3.org, archived at 
http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-lld/ )
using descriptive subject lines such as '[COMMENTS] "Benefits" section'

Comments will be especially welcome in the next four weeks (through 22
July).  Reviewers should note that as with Wikipedia, the text may be revised
and corrected by its editors in response to comments at any time, but that
earlier versions of a document may be viewed by clicking on the History tab.

It is anticipated that the three reports will be published in final form by 
31
August.

Apologies for cross posting but the Open Data in Science working group is
organising the hackathon below, which will make use of Open Bibliographic
Data so I thought it may be of interest to this list also!

Please let me know if you're interested in helping/participating.

Dear All

The working group is organising a hackathon as part of the SWAT4LS
conference (http://www.swat4ls.org/) - see below for more details and a call
for volunteers!

When: Wednesday 7 December 2011, all day

Where: ULU, London (TBC)

What:
A one day open data in science hackathon with partcipants from the Semantic
Web for the Life Sciences community.
The theme is to be generating open research reports using bibliographic data
from PubMedCentral, focussing on malaria research. It is also designed to
demonstrate what can be done with open data and discussions/ideas generated
throughout the day will doubtless be wide ranging! Demos and discussions
will also take place at the SWAT4LS meeting proper the next day.

What we need:
Volunteers with hackathon experience to assist on the day, and also in
developing a framework for participants prior to the day itself, to ensure
it is as productive as possible.

If you're interested in assisting, let me know at jenny.molloy at okfn.org

Thanks very much!

Jenny

I've suggested those on the JISCOpenBib project, and Hope I will be able to

with a critical mass should get off the ground.
