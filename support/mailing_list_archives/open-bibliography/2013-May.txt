=========================================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR:

VIVO is a semantic web application focused on discovering researchers and
research publications in the life sciences.  The service, which uses
open-source software originally developed and implemented at Cornell
University, operates by harvesting data about researcher interests,
activities, and accomplishments from academic, administrative,
professional, and funding sources.  Using a built-in, editable ontology for
describing things such as People, Courses, and Publications, data is
transformed into a Semantic-Web-compliant form.  VIVO provides automated
and self-updating processes for improving data quality and authenticity.
Starting with a classic Google-style search box, VIVO users can browse
search results structured around people, research interests, courses,
publications, and the like -- data that can be exposed for re-use by other
systems in a machine-readable format.

This webinar, held by a veteran at the Albert R. Mann Library Information
Technology Services department at Cornell, where the VIVO project was born,
presents the perspective of a software developer on the practicalities of
building a high-quality Semantic-Web search service on existing data
maintained in dozens of formats and software platforms at large, diverse
institutions.  The talk will highlight services that leverage the Semantic
Web platform in innovative ways, e.g., for finding researchers based on the
text content of a particular Web page and for visualizing networks of
collaboration across institutions.

SPEAKER:

John Fereira, a senior programmer/analyst and technology strategist at
Cornell University, is a contributing member of the VIVO project team.  He
also consults on issues related to information technology in higher
education with an emphasis on open-source, modular, distributed software
systems and is currently working on systems based on VIVO software for
international Agricultural Information systems communities.

Registration closes one hour before the webinar begins.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Deadline extension for SWIB13 (Semantic Web in
 Libraries) to 9.6.2013
Message-ID: <519DDDB002000014000500DB@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

The submission deadline for  the fifth conference "Semantic Web in Libraries" (SWIB),  25.-27.11.2013 in Hamburg, has been extended to June 9, 2013. The call for proposals here once again:


Call for Proposals: SWIB13 - Semantic Web in Libraries Conference ("Semantic Web in Bibliotheken"), 25.11. - 27.11.2013, Hamburg

Linked Open Data (LOD) has become a widespread method for the publication and management of data on the web. Many libraries and related institutions have already run projects or launched products that comply with the LOD paradigm. New projects, services and tools are emerging continuously.

The SWIB conference aims to provide substantial information on LOD developments relevant to the library world and to forster the exchange of ideas and experiences among practicioners. SWIB encourages thinking outside the box by involving participants and speakers from other domains, such as scholarly communications, museums and archives, or the publishing and news industry.

As in the years before, SWIB13 will be organized by the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz) and the ZBW - German National Library of Economics /  Leibniz Information Centre for Economics. The conference language is English.

Is there an interesting service, research topic or project that you would like to present at the conference? Or, can you offer giving a tutorial or a workshop on the afternoon of 25 November? We appreciate  proposals on the following or related topics:

Projects & Applications

* publication & consumption of linked data
* integration of LOD into productive library applications
* authorities and knowledge organization systems (thesauri, classifications, ontologies)
* mash-ups (using data from different sources)
* crowdsourcing approaches

Technology (focus on Open Source software)

* semantically enhanced data publication
* data integration/enhancement/mapping
* searching/information retrieval
* linked data in library systems

Standards & Best Practices

* Bibframe, DAIA & other library specific open standards
* provenance information
* providing updates & syncing data sources
* open data licensing

We are looking forward to receiving your proposals by *26 May 2013*. 
Please include an abstract of 1000-1500 characters and submit your abstract using our website at http://swib.org.
