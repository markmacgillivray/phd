Crossref is not only a particular technology but also a business model that
involves the publishers providing citation information. I don't know the
details but I suspect publishers use it because they get greater exposure.
An Open implementation might have this attraction for publishers but it
would be seen as a threat by publishers who aggregate and sell raw citation
material and also downstream services.

There are therefore at least two separate questions:

   - how do we get Open citation data
   - how do we build the technology to make it useful

I think the first is the hardest - I am not sure whether thisw was involved
in the original question (which used Crossref as an example)

===============================================================
NISO/DCMI Webinar: Schema.org and Linked Data: Complementary Approaches to
Publishing Data
PRESENTER: Dan Brickley

DATE: April 25, 2012
TIME: 1:00pm - 2:30pm Eastern (17:00-18:30 UTC)
INFORMATION & REGISTRATION:
http://www.niso.org/news/events/2012/dcmi/linked_data/
===============================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR

Schema.org--a collaboration of the Google, Yahoo!, and Bing search
engines--provides a way to include structured data in Web pages. Since its
introduction in June 2011, the Schema.org vocabulary has grown to cover
descriptive terms for content such as movies, music, organizations, TV
shows, products, locations, news items, and job listings. The goal of
Schema.org is "to improve the display of search results, making it easier
for people to find the right web pages." The Schema.org initiative has
emerged as a focal point for publishers of structured data in Web pages,
especially but not exclusively in the commercial sector.

This webinar will explore how the publication methods of Schema.org relate
to the methods used to publish Linked Data. Must data providers commit to
one or the other, or can the two approaches exist side-by-side, even
reinforcing each other?

TOPICS AND SPEAKERS

Dan Brickley is best known for his work on Web standards in the W3C
community, where he helped create the Semantic Web project and many of its
defining technologies. Dan is currently working on outreach activities
related to the Schema.org initiative. Previous work included six years on
the W3C technical staff, establishing ILRT's Semantic Web group at the
University of Bristol, and more recently at Joost, an Internet TV start-up,
and at the Vrije University Amsterdam. He has been involved with resource
discovery metadata since 1994 when he published the first HTML Philosophy
guide on the Web, and has been exploring distributed, collaborative
approaches to "finding stuff" ever since.

Thomas Baker, Chief Information Officer of the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative, has recently co-chaired the W3C Semantic Web Deployment Working
Group and the W3C Incubator Group on Library Linked Data.

REGISTRATION
Registration is per site (access for one computer) and closes at 12:00 pm
Eastern (16:00 UTC) on April 25, 2012. Discounts are available for NISO and
DCMI members and students.

Can't make it on the webinar date/time? Register now and gain access to the
recorded archive for one year. NISO/DCMI are holding four joint webinars in
2012. Register for three and receive the 4th for free.

Quote:

"Nature Publishing Group (NPG) today is pleased to join the linked
data community by opening up access to its publication data via a
linked data platform. NPG's Linked Data Platform is available at
http://data.nature.com.

The platform includes more than 20 million Resource Description
Framework (RDF) statements, including primary metadata for more than
450,000 articles published by NPG since 1869. In this first release,
the datasets include basic citation information (title, author,
publication date, etc) as well as NPG specific ontologies. These
datasets are being released under an open metadata license, Creative
Commons Zero (CC0), which permits maximal use/re-use of this data."

As far as I can see there are no dumps available yet...

All the best
Adrian

Subject: [open-bibliography] Five years on: major conference on libraries
 and the Semantic Web, 27 April 2012 - Final announcement
Message-ID: <CAP884Ex-0TQngxonvNTN7MpwktTrnO+aXFLXAmkX9GK=iUQDPw@mail.gmail.com>

There are still places available for the Seminar ?Five years on?, marking
the five years of progress in library linked data since the ?London
Meeting? of 2007. The Seminar takes place on Friday 27 April 2012, 09.00/30
to 17.00. The venue for the Seminar is the British Library, St. Pancras,
London.

The final list of speakers for the Seminar includes:

* Mikael Nilsson, Google
* Edmund Chamberlain, Cambridge University Library
* Alan Danskin, British Library
* Barbara Tillett, Joint Steering Committee for the Development of RDA (JSC)
* Robina Claphan, Europeana
* Mirna Willer, IFLA ISBD Review Group
* Pat Riva, IFLA FRBR Review Group
* Thomas Baker, DCMI
* Gordon Dunsire, IFLA Namespaces Technical Group and DCMI
* Diane Hillmann, DCMI and Metadata Management Associates
* Owen Stephens, JISC

The London Meeting of 31 April/1 May 2007 stimulated significant
development of Semantic Web representations of the major international
bibliographic metadata models, including IFLA?s Functional Requirements
family and the International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD), and
MARC as well as RDA itself. Attention is now beginning to focus on the
management and sustainability of this activity, and the development of
high-level semantic and data structures to support library applications.

Registration for the Seminar has been set at USD 190 (including VAT), which
includes lunch and refreshments for two breaks. Further information and
online registration is available at:

http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/BibData/fyo

Please note that registration for the DCMI meetings on Thursday 26 April
has now closed, as all places have been taken.

Cheers, and apologies for cross-posting.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Norwegian Personal Name Authority File
Message-ID: <CAE9vqEGFtOEoipAqB8BzXJiAT++C25ap9qU8frqgotNjtO0s=A@mail.gmail.com>

Has anyone here attempted to work with the linked data version of the
Norwegian personal name authorities file?

http://www.bibsys.no/files/out/linked_data/autreg/index.html
http://openbiblio.net/2011/04/06/radata-na-norwegian-personal-name-authorities-as-linked-open-data/

I noticed that it had some owl:sameAs links to VIAF in it, so I
figured it would be pretty easy to link up with other data, but then I
discovered that they've got multiple VIAF links for a single name
authority record as well as a single VIAF record being linked to
multiple name authority records.  I can just ignore anything which is
multiply linked, but it makes me suspicious of the quality of the rest
of the links.  I'm wondering if perhaps they just did a simple name
match without any criteria.  This would make it inadvisable to use
even the 1:1 matches.

Here's an example which is linked 17 times one way and 8 the other:

Message-ID: <CACGRf4LGA-z3ojMsWoOHR67BnD+hhe4WohW7SW+75ZN5wEfoMQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

Further to the e-mail about our proposed Hackathon, 12th-14th June 2012,
please see below for some more information.

*If you are interested in coming, please respond as we would appreciate a
'show of hands'* - this isn't 'I will be attending', just 'I am interested'
or even 'I know someone who would be up for this' - it helps us know what
to book in terms of size of venue, number of biscuits, plug sockets
required, etc etc!

Note - all these details are to be confirmed and input is welcome - only
the dates are set:

-------
Schedule:
* Tues: Meet-up at a pub, say 17.00 - 20.00 (this is not a mandatory part
of the Hackathon but is an opportunity to talk about Open Data with
like-minded individuals);
* Weds: Hack Day 1, start 10.00, be fed and watered, and stay overnight for
those who want to;
* Thurs: Hack Day 2, start 10.00, be fed and watered and head off around
16.30-17.00.

Venue: likely to be Queen Mary University
University of London
Mile End Road
London
E1 4NS

Groups involved:
* Open Biblio <http://openbiblio.net/> - emphasising the utilisation of
tools we've developed;
* Open Knowledge Foundation's Working Group on Open Data in Cultural
Heritage and GLAM <http://openglam.org/>;
* DevCSI <http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/> - encouraging diverse thinking around
software development and technical innovation.
-------

Nearer the time I'll get back in touch to ask about overnight
accommodation, dietary requirements, access requirements and so on, but in
the meantime please respond if you want to be counted in.

Thanks,
Naomi

That's great and makes me wonder:

1) Are there any good examples of how people are reusing catalog records?

2) All these various platforms for digitization, institutional repositories,
digital asset management or content management, which of them can output or
input catalog records? I'm thinking of Fedora, OJS, DSpace and the like.

  Erhh, shared cataloging a la OCLC? I suspect the release of such data
  will have OCLC competitors (or potential competitors) rub their hands.

Great news! I've added a dataset on the DataHub for it:

<http://datahub.io/dataset/harvard-library-catalog>

(Still missing the API if you would like to add it!)

I've also added to the Bibliographic group:

Subject: [open-bibliography] SWIB12 CfP - Semantic Web in Libraries (Cologne,
 26 - 28/11/2012)
Message-ID: <4F97CD7802000014000474E9@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

Call for Participation: SWIB12 "Semantic Web in Bibliotheken"
(Semantic Web in Libraries) Conference, 26.11. - 28.11.2012, Cologne

To an ever increasing extent Linked Open Data (LOD) is developing
into a mainstream topic, with more and more organisations announcing
LOD projects and services. Furthermore and during the last two years
Linked Open Data has received a lot more attention from the library
world. Examples ranging from the Library of Congress' initiative "A
Bibliographic Framework for the Digital Age", the Conference of
European National Librarians and their vote to support the open
licensing of their data to groups like LODLAM, IFLA'S Semantic Web
Special Interest Group, to  library system vendors and providers
discussing and experimenting with Linked Data technology clearly
reflect that -  LOD has gained a lot of momentum in library land.

The question is how to ensure that LOD won't be a temporary hype but
that it will take hold in future infrastructures. SWIB12  will focus
on  the adaption of Semantic Web approaches in applications for
libraries and science. In the last years lots of effort has been put
into generating LOD datasets from legacy systems and into promoting
the LOD approach towards a global and open information space.
Upcoming challenges will be the strategic and technical alignment of
catalogues and legacy systems in libraries, and authoring
environments for scholarly communication with a data and service
infrastructure based on Semantic Web principles.

This year's SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Bibliotheken) will be
held in Cologne from 26-28 November 2012. As in the years before,
SWIB12 will be organized by the North Rhine-Westphalian Library
Service Center (hbz) and the ZBW - German National Library of
Economics /  Leibniz Information Centre for Economics. The
conference language is English.

We appreciate proposals (research reports, projects, work in
progress, ...) on the following or related topics:

* Integration of Linked Data into productive library environments

* Technologies for providing, accessing and integrating Linked Data
in a non-disruptive and lightweighted way, e.g. by means of APIs or
WebServices


* Enhancing authoring environments like Content Management Systems,
blogs or wikis with Semantic Web facilities, e.g. by accessing
Linked Open Datasets or by including semantic markup

* Enhancing legacy data through integration of data from the LOD
cloud or through FRBRizing, deduplication, crowdsourcing etc.

* Applications using authority data maintained by libraries and
possibly enriched by the community

* Development of commercial or non-commercial library systems
aligning their data models and policies with the web of data

* Licensing strategies and business models for supporting the reuse
of Linked Open Data

Do you have an interesting service, research topic or project that
you would like to present at the conference? We are looking forward
to receiving your suggestions and proposals for contributions (with
an abstract of 1000-1500 characters) by 20 May 2012. Please submit
your abstract using our website at http://swib.org/swib12.

Very cool.  What is the best forum to discuss and ask questions?  For
example, the documentation says that the dump will be refreshed weekly
-- is there any plan to offer an updates feed (e.g. Atom) a la LC
Identities feed?  Any plan to offer data dumps of the data available
through the API (it seems to contain something different than pure
MARC21)?

Tom,

Good questions. Be prepared for mediocre answers.

1. There isn't a forum established for this. There should at least be
a discussion page. I'll suggest that. Thanks. In the meantime, I'll
forward these questions to the small list of people who have been
working on this initiative for the past year.

2. An updates feed is a great idea. It may already be contemplated.

3. I can answer the API dump question with a little more authority
since the API access is being offered via the DPLA prototype platform
that our group is working on. So, yes, you're right. API queries to
fields within the dpla namespace sometimes return enhanced data,
especially wrt uniform title, but eventually there will be more (e.g.
clean up date formats, etc.). We should be offering that data for
download, and we'll get around to it. But there's a lot on our plate
now. In the meantime, if you need that enhanced data, we'll be happy
to make it available to you ahead of time. If there's strong demand
for these tables, that'll bump it up the todo list.

This is great stuff---my thanks to everyone involved in getting this out 
there!

My question follows on Tom's about a forum for discussion, or a place to 
ask questions.  I want to do something with the call numbers but the 
records don't seem to use the 050 or 090 consistently.  Is there someone 
who could explain the source of truth for call numbers?  David, perhaps 
you could pass it on?

Bill

  I could run a mailman list on lists.openlib.org, if there is 
  interested. I will need a list name and the email address 
  of a list owner. I could do the list owner myself.

Dear Colleagues,

In preparation for the International Workshop on Contributorship and 
Scholarly Attribution 
<http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/attribution_workshop/> at Harvard next 
month, I have prepared the following to enable the contributions of 
authors and others to research investigations and resulting journal 
articles to be recorded in an easy and systematic manner, so as better 
to attribute credit for their contributions:

    SCoRO, the Scholarly Contributions and Roles Ontology, available at
    http://purl.org/spar/scoro/
    SCoRF, a Scholarly Contributions Report Form, available
    athttp://purl.org/spar/scoro/SCoRF.xls
    A presentation for the Workshop, explaining them both,
    available
    athttp://purl.org/spar/scoro/Shotton_SCoRO_and_SCoRF_Contributions-Workshop_Harvard_16May2012.pdf

I hope you find these relevant and of interest.  I would be most 
grateful for any feedback, particularly if it can be given before May 10th.

Please feel free to distribute this message widely.

Best wishes,

David

I think a bulletin board might be more useful, so that the messages
remain publicly available and searchable. I could set one up at
QuickTopic.com.

If you'd prefer a mailing list, then you are more than welcome to join
the existing mailing list for people interested in the development of
the DPLA platform our group has been working on:

dpla-dev at eon.law.harvard.edu

Apologies, two of the embedded URIs below the (correct) text in my 
original message got somehow inadvertently shortened to

    SCoRF, a Scholarly Contributions Report Form, available
