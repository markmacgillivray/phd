Hello,

here's a - rather short-term - reminder that the virtual meeting will
happen today at 15:00 GMT. See this etherpad for the details:
http://new.okfnpad.org/p/34th-open-bibliography-meeting

I will say something about the lobid API we recently launched. I
believe others will have interesting developments to report as well.
Please add these to the etherpad.

All the best
Adrian

===============================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR:

One key challenge for e-Government programs around the world has been the
lack of easily accessible information about the metadata schemas,
controlled vocabularies, code lists, and other reference data that provide
interoperability among a broad diversity of data sources.

The Asset Description Metadata Schema [1] was developed for exchanging
information about such "interoperability assets". The schema was developed
with support from the European Commission with the objective of
facilitating interoperability across eGovernment programmes in Europe, but
it is already proving its usefulness in a wider context, for example to
describe specifications maintained by DCMI and W3C. One key implementation
of ADMS is in a federation of semantic asset repositories on the Joinup
server [2].

Libraries that collect government information will benefit if such
information is based on a set of commonly used schemas, vocabularies and
code lists, making it easier to aggregate information from multiple
sources. This webinar introduces the ADMS schema and discusses examples of
its implementation.

ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:

Makx Dekkers has been the editor in the development and consensus process
for ADMS. He is an independent information professional who has been
working in areas of information management, metadata and interoperability
for more than three decades. After a career start in library and
information networking and international cooperation, he became the
Managing Director at DCMI in 2001, a position he held until 2011. Since
then, he has been involved with projects concerning interoperability in the
areas of Open Government Data and Public Sector information.

Stijn Goedertier, Manager at PriceWaterhouseCoopers Belgium, is a key
participant in the ADMS project.

REGISTRATION:

Registration is per site (access for one computer) and closes at 12:00 pm
Eastern (16:00 UTC) on October 30, 2013. Discounts are available for NISO
and DCMI members and students.
