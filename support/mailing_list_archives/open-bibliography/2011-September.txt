Subject: [open-bibliography] Survey on name identifier systems

  I was given a survey on name identifier systems. Here are my
  answers for AuthorClaim. I think I am trying to press the
  case for open data but I may not be able to put it as 
  effectively as it could be done. Comments?

  ----------------------------------------------------------------

1. What was the motivation for developing the identifier system?

  AuthorClaim is a part of building openly available bibliographic
  systems. I have considerable experience with such systems because I
  was the principle founder of RePEc. Within RePEc, the RePEc Author
  System (RAS) plays an important role. It allows researchers to
  claim their papers. I create RAS in 1999. It was the first author
  claiming system. 

2. Which organisation(s) is (are) responsible for the identifier
   system?

  Ultimately the Open Library Society is. I am building a small
  group of individuals looking after the day-to-day management. 
  It's part of a broader effort for open bibliographic data. 

3. What is the scope of your identifier system, in terms of the type of
   people it covers? (For example, does it include: book authors, active
   current researchers, formerly active researchers, doctoral students, masters
   students etc.)

  Anybody can come and register claims to the bibliographic data. 
  If they have no items to claim, they may find the registration
  not very interesting. Getting as much bibliographic data as 
  possible to appeal to a broad group of authors. 

4. How is your system populated with data? (by researchers
   themselves/their institutions/funding bodies)

  This is a author claiming systems. Authors make claims. But their
  records are dwarfed by the amount of bibliographical records. 
  There are more that 35 million bibliographic records. Over 100
  million authorships are up for claim. 

5. Who is authorised to make changes to the information in the system?

  Authors make changes to their records and bibliographic datasets
  contribute bibliographic records. 

6. How are identifiers assigned?

  When a registrant registers, a new identifier is created.

7. What form does the identifier take?

  There two identifiers. The identifier of the person is only used in
  internally. It is a long identifier that combines a date in the
  person's live with an ascii only name expression. Externally, we
  issue a short identifier that starts with p, has two letters and
  then a number that is incremented. This short identifier is not,
  strictly speaking an identifier for the person but the identifier
  of the record in the system that describes the person in the
  AuthorClaim system.

8. What information is maintained in the system? (e.g. names,
   alternative forms of names, email addresses, dates of birth,
   institutional affiliation(s), details of publications, details of
   grants received/applied for) Are any standard metadata schemes
   supported?

  We make names, name variations, dates (but not of birth),
  affiliations, publications accepted and refused publicly
  available. Email addresses are made publicly available if the
  registrant agrees explicitly. Passwords are not made available.

   The bulk of the information in the system is bibliographic. 

9. With which other systems (if any) does your identifier system
   interact?

  We work with bibliographic data providers. We are building a profiling
  site, http://authorprofile.org, (still in its infancy) and we 
  use the data is used in ARIW.org. In fact there is a complicated
  interaction between ARIW and AuthorClaim. 

10. Is the information in the system made available to other services?

  Yes. And there are some other services using it, but these are
  close relatives of AuthorClaim. Reaching further is still a 
  challenge. 

11. Is there a licence on the data? If so, what is the licence?

  CC0. Note the profile data wraps bibliographic data but this
  bibliographic data is reduced to element commonly thought to
  be in the public domain. 

12. If yes, how is this achieved (what interfaces/protocols are used)
    and is the system free to access?

  There is an ftp site for the AuthorClaim data at ftp://authorclaim.org

13. How is the system funded?

  The underlying software was developed with a grant from the open
  society institute. 

  There is no stable funding sources for open bibliographic data. The
  system is run by volunteers since 2007. We have a very good track
  record of keeping the system running. RePEc runs like that since the
  early 90s. You can't make this type of service dependent on external
  funding. And I am sure once AuthorClaim becomes more widely adopted
  we find volunteers to deal with some mundane tasks and funds to
  bring in automation that will further reduce these tasks.

14. Is the system still under active development? If so, what are your
    priorities for future enhancements?

  Yes, there will be some further work on the system, to make it run
  smoother, with more automation and less input from humans. Research
  will be conducted in how to optimize the guesses made by computer
  learning to available. There are funds for the development of ACIS
  and they will be used on adding a host of smaller thing, most
  importantly for us, the integration with openID. 
  

15. Do you have any plans for integrating your system with external
    initiatives/services such as ORCID, ISNI, Mendeley, Zotero, Academia.edu?

  and ResearchGate, and PeerEvaluation and ...
  It's a crowded field. AuthorClaim is an initiative that is open.
  Many of the commercial initiative collect data but they don't handle
  the data further. With ORCID, it is not clear to me where the system
  will be heading too, and I am speaking for experience because I am 
  in their technical commitment. I see INSI as a parallel thing to us.
  I have not seen Mendeley and Academia.edu offering lists of papers
  deposited, but I should write to Richard to task. I talked to 
  the Mendeley CEO a while ago.

Dear friends,

I would like to bring to your knowledge the Romanian translation of the principles.

I have attached them in both versions PDF and ODF (please look on the blog that the original ODF file link is broken).

Also, the Principles were published on Kosson Library and Information Science Community page at www.kosson.ro

Keep up the good work and please consider our community as a channel open towards Romanian information specialists.

Kind regards,

Hello Nicolaus,

great that you took the time to translate the Principles on Open
Bibliographic Data. Thank you very much for your contribution.

Also, it's nice to see that some more people have signed the
openbiblio principles. Somebody must've done some promotional work.
:-) As there must be several people on this list who haven't yet
signed the openbiblio principles I just want to gently remind
everybody that the possibility exists and making use of it it doesn't
take more than a minute at http://openbiblio.net/principles/endorse/

Nicolaus, I already added your translation to the website but to
publish it I need these phrases to be translated as well:

- "English Original"
- "Endorse the Principles"
- "Introduction" (Obviously, the PDF version and the HTML version
differ in this respect... I'd like to add it to the web like the other
language versions.)
- "Translation from the English original by Nicolaus Kreschmer,
September 2nd, 2011."
- At last: what's the Romanian word for "Romanian"?

As for the ODT files. Wordpress doesn't take these because of security
concerns. I removed the dead links from the pages.

All the best
Adrian

Subject: [open-bibliography] SWIB11 (Semantic Web in Libraries) 28.-30.11.
 in Hamburg - Registration opens
Message-ID: <4E6493F90200001400041954@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

SWIB11 (Semantic Web in Libraries) 28.-30.11.2011 in Hamburg
publishes conference program and opens registration

http://swib.org/swib11/ 

A rising number of actors in librarianship and its related fields
are experimenting with Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open
Data (LOD). The LOD cloud as a whole grew by 300% in 2010, whereas
the amount of data relevant for libraries grew by nearly 1000%.
For many, the question now arises how to integrate their holdings
into the LOD cloud and how to embed externally provided LOD data
into their own applications, adding value through cross-domain
linking. The first conference day will focus on the corresponding
infrastructure requirements.

At the same time, the principles and workflows of traditional
scholarly communication and publication are under scrutiny with a
view to a consistently web-based data and service infrastructure
comprising the entire research and publication process. Concepts
like "Semantic Publishing", "Enhanced Publications" or "Research
Objects" mark the re-orientation of academic work, away from
monolithic, comparatively unflexible and barely interlinked
reference points towards a distributed, comparatively granular
data infrastructure which is continuously accessible to
researchers and into which their contributions recognizably
return. These developments will be discussed on the second day of
the conference.

For the first time we offer workshops and tutorials on the day
before the main conference, providing introductions into Linked
Open Data for newcomers and practice-oriented discussion of
selected problems.

The conference will again - as in 2009 and 2010 - be organised by
the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz), Cologne,
and the German National Library of Economics - Leibniz Information
Centre for Economics (ZBW), Kiel and Hamburg.

Hello,

today should be the next virtual meeting of the working group. As the
August meeting didn't take place we should definitely meet in
September. As I have been quite busy with my family for the last weeks
I have problems with meetings in the afternoon. My apologies for this,
but I most probably will be more flexible again after this week.

There are two possibilities:
- The meeting will be held today at 5:00 GMT / 16:00 UK Time / 17:00
CET / 11:00 EST / 08:00 PDT . (Who has time to attend? Who would host
the call and do the moderation?)
- We postpone the meeting to next tuesday.

What do you think?

All the best
Adrian

Hi Adrian,

I think it would be good to have it next week if you are free then -
as it has been while, it would be nicer to catch up when you can make
it too.

Hello,

the Romanian translation of the Principles on Open Bibliographic Data
is now online, see http://openbiblio.net/principles/ro/

Thank you for providing it, Nicolaie.

Of course, it would be very good to publish more translations of the
principles to other languages. Everybody, if you are fluent in a
language which isn't covered yet, please think about contributing
another translation...

All the best
Adrian

Hi,

I've been following this list for a while silently. My second native language is Polish,
do you have anyone working on that translation? O could give it a go in the near future.

Best,
Karol

Hello Karol,

that would be great if you provided a Polish translation. AFAIK, we
only have a Korean version in the pipeline.

All the best

Thanks very much. I think there will be a lot that the OKF generates where
translations will be valuable. It's also a very good way of showing new
visitors that we care.

Have http://pantonprinciples.org/ been translated? :-) I seem to remember
so, but can't find it in a search

There is no Romanian translation for it. Please let me know if you do
have the Romanian translation, if not, I will get on that right away.

	base
Message-ID: <CAOtd05Eabfq3CNdNxUe58679BTMX43cF6moUsB-PHoPd-Zx-+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

on Saturday a project was introduced at the Wikipedia Convention.
Jakob Vo? has written about it (in German) in his blog.[1] See the
English wiki page for the project[2], where it reads:

"Libraries and archives all over the world are increasingly ready to
release their electronical catalogue entries. What follows is the plan
to create a Wikipedia source for such information: a source which
users should not only consult to locate materials but also to
intelligently connect, comment and correct information they find.

(...)

The ideal tool would become a central data base in the Wikipedia
universe. Correct information within this database and the respective
entries in Wikipedia articles that refer to this piece of information
show the new data (perhaps even with the research reference given in
the data base). Wikisource-should be able to use our data. (...)

The entire project should be seen as a first step into the arena of
structured data."

In 2012 will be a workshop on this project.[3]

Wikimedia is one of the organizations most interested in open
bibliographic data. They have very much supported the open
bibliographic data movement. It is only consequent that they are now
starting a project like this. We should see how we can cooperate.

All the best
Adrian

Dear Peter,

Please, find attached the Romanian version for the Panton Principles.

I agree. Is there a volunteer on this list willing to act as a point
of contact between OKFN/openbiblio and this effort? 
I do have somewhere a list of names of people involved with a currently stalled Wikimedia effort to 
provide an adequately structured database of books and articles cited in Wikipedia. I'll be glad to 
find the list and share with anyone who has the time to follow up on this.

I hope this could build on or cooperate with the current OKFN project

http://publicdomainworks.net/

"Public Domain Works is an open registry of cultural works that are in the public domain. It also provides a web API for calculating public domain status of works."

Is it envisioned that the Registry would provide an index of metadata for all works that it includes? If so, how would this metadata be acquired, and what 
would be the copyright/licensing status of this metadata? I would hope it would be compatible with http://openbiblio.net/principles/

I am sure that Daniel Mietchen (Wikimedian in Residence) will be able to
suggest ideas.

I am sure that Wiki(m/p)edia is a great opportunity for us to deploy Open
Bibliography. I think there are several aspects and it would be useful for
us to list them. My own suggestions are:
 * all bibliographic references in Wikipedia should be normalised and
created as a pot of Bibsoup. This will obviously take time but it's a great
way to get a consistent, high-quality crowd-souced pot of soup.
* all references should - if possible - include a description of the rights
of the referenced object. e.g. if someone references an Open Access paper,
then it should be denoted as such in WP. This would be a tremendous example
of the power of OB.
* I assume the references will become part of DBPedia. A clear use of
BibJSON would help to make this easy.

P.

Just to let you know, we have two projects going on at the Harvard
Library Innovation Lab that may bear on this:

1. Our Lab just completed the first part of an effort to locate the
articles about books in the English Wikipedia. We're in the process of
writing up the results, but the short version (not for distribution
yet, please, because we're still drafting the post about it): 1.
Wikipedia does not make it easy to identify pages that are about
books. The category system doesn't work the way one hopes. The
ever-helpful dbpedia is only of limited help with this. 2. We've
identified a total of 57,000 articles that are about books; that is,
the article has the title of a book as its own title, and is devoted
to that book. We got to this number via category lookups, through some
brute force interrogation, and by refining the results via Mechanical
Turk.

2.  We have talked over the past year with SJ Klein, who is a
Wikipedia Docent and on the Wikimedia board, about integrating
LibraryCloud with his idea for giving a permanent page to every work
cited in Wikipedia. LibraryCloud is a metadata server gathering
library metadata (circ data, user reviews, etc.) and making it openly
available via APIs and Linked Open Data. This is a multi-library
initiative that's been under development for about 1.5 years, with
five contributing libraries at the moment, and about 15M items.  We
are on the verge of making it accessible to a limited public (API key
required, daily queries limited to 3,152). We're interested in
contributing what we can as we can. (No, we cannot make its catalog
available in its entirety. We wish.)

These two paragraphs contradict each other. 
Is LibraryCloud an open data provider, or not?
Either data is open, and it is possible to get hold of the entire
dataset with a clear open license for what you can so with it. Or it is not open. 
It is wrong to call data open if it is subject to arbitary access restrictions like 3K entries a day.

This is a major challenge for the OKF and I think we need to tackle it now.
The world is full of Free (but only to X), Open (but you can't use it for
Y), Open API (but only for a subset). These all have to be challenged.

There ARE objective technical problems with completely Open data resources
(e.g. what is the extent? what are the revisions? How do I get the whole
lot? etc.). These are not easy even with a clear understanding and goodwill.
Where the concepts are fuzzy it is much harder.

(I think I wrote the same thing to the Open Science list...)

Rather than sit back and allow David to be hoisted on his own petard, I feel
it necessary to point out a few things. This list does not own the term
"open" and neither does it get to declare when the use of it is appropriate.
You DO get to declare a set of terms around a specific use of it, such as
"open as defined by the Working Group on Open Bibliographic Data" but that's
about it.

This is also why the kind of discussion that might reveal the nuances of
"open" cannot happen here due to religious-style zealotry. If something
isn't "open" according to your strict standards it isn't open at all. This
completely misses the fact that "open" as in the Harvard API may be
completely fine and useful for nearly all real world purposes.

If I can accomplish useful work with Harvard's API (and I likely can,
although I haven't yet tested it out), then great. Whether I can download
the entire dataset may be completely immaterial (and usually is) to getting
that useful work accomplished. But then practicality isn't what this group
is about, it's about religion. Now I will go back to lurking, where I expect
to take my lumps like a man. Wake me up again when you're ready to have that
nuanced discussion.

Thanks for the challenge, Jim. Thanks for the petard snipping, Roy.

As I just wrote to Jim: At this point, we cannot make all our catalog
data available for bulk download. That is a limitation we all regret
but there it is.  I would argue that because the data we make
available we make available without restriction, it is reasonable to
use "open" as a modifier. It may also be worth mentioning that the
point of LibraryCloud is not and never has been to make catalog data
available. Rather, it is to gather and make accessible less-noticed
metadata from libraries; we need catalog data so that other metadata
has a referent.

We're trying to do something useful and collaborative within the
limitations under which we labor, and we hope that what we're
contributing is of some value. Whether it merits the lofty adjective
"open" is to me an interesting discussion, but not the most
interesting one.

The OKF has defined "Open Knowledge" in the Open Definition

It is generally accepted on lists run by the OKF that "Open" refers to this
definition.

When using this concept elsewhere  I either capitalize it ("Open") or use
"OKD-compliant" to make it clear that there is a formal definition.

The lax use of "open" adds no value. If the word can be defined to mean
whatever the author likes, then it is redundant (unless specifically
defined). Thus there is no difference between:

"the data are openly available"
and
"the data are available"

There is great importance in defining what is meant by "open". The Open
Source community has put great effort into this through the Open Source
Initiative (http://www.opensource.org/ ). It has now been able to reach the
stage where "Open Source" is universally understood as "OSI-compliant".

By contrast the Open Access movement has taken a decade to converge on a
practical definition of Open Access. This matters; if an author has to pay
3000 USD to have a paper regarded as Open Access it is important that we

This is not religious; it's practical. If we are going to use "open" as a
useful label then it has to be defined. If people are going to pay money, or
change their business model, then it should be crystal clear.

"open" as in "the Harvard API" adds no information. Instead call it "the
Harvard conditions" and point us at the place where they are PRECISELY
defined. And precise definitions matter. If we do something that is not
allowed we may end up being sued. If we don't know what is allowed then we
either break the rules or are too afraid to do anything.

The advantage of the OKD is that it is universal and almost always trivial
to understand and implement. There may be cases where it isn't appropriate -
fine - but in that case you should describe precsiely what you want and what
you don't want. And that has to be explainable to everyone involved. The OSI
found that writing your own licence was very complex and dangerous - so most
people use an OSI-compliant licence

The OKF welcomes everyone - it is not relligious and very practical. Its
definition is being adopted by publishers, funders, governments beacuse
*they* need precise guidelines. For example it took two years' work to
create the Panton Principles for Open Science data
http://pantonprinciples.org/ and Open Access publishers such as Biomed
Central are now adopting them because they are *useful*. The Open
Bibliography principles follow the same philosophy. We believe they are
useful in the same way.

There's not a lot that I agree with the OCLC on, but in this case I'm
in 100% agreement with Roy.  Attempts to legislate language usage down
to the single word level are not only doomed to failure, but the
stridency will drive reasonable people away.

This understanding isn't anywhere near as universal as you seem to
think.  Just a few days ago ReadWriteWeb (RWW) published a rant where
they totally misunderstood what open source is about.
http://www.readwriteweb.com/hack/2011/09/point-whats-this-i-hear-about.php
 If you were to talk to Richard Stallman, I bet he'd tell you that
"open" is meaningless and what you've got to insist on is "free"
(where he's the sole arbiter of what the word "free" means).  Such
zealotry is divisive.

In my opinion, inclusive approaches which attempt to find common
ground with interested parties are much more powerful.

Open is a spectrum.  I haven't looked at the Harvard license/terms of
service (which is what really matters, not the catch phrase they use),
but I suspect when I do I'll find the data is more open than it was,
but less open than I'd like it to be.

Peter, thank you. This is exactly the kind of nuanced and informative
message I expect of a professional discussion, and I?m gratified to see it.
It has been sufficient to lure me once again out of lurking into the light.

>It is generally accepted on lists run by the OKF that "Open" refers to this
definition. 

I can see where this may be true, but it does tend to ignore the real world,
in which the use of the term ?open? is much more nebulous. I guess what I
was trying to say, perhaps clumsily, is that without either explicit
reference to a definition of open (e.g., the OKD) or an implicit (I suppose
one could argue that the capitalized ?Open Access? term may fall into this
camp), then one should likely default to ?open as in non-proprietary? or
?open as in not closed? definitions that exist out there in the world. And
then, as you suggest, one would need to check the terms and conditions that
apply.

My main complaint was that Jim Pittman claimed ownership of the term ?open?
-- not ?open as defined by OKD? or  even ?Open Data?. ?Open? as in I can
download the entire data set or else it isn?t ?open? at all. I would like to
suggest that out in the world the use of the term is more nuanced. David
said, in part that Harvard was making the data ?openly available via APIs
and Linked Open Data? -- a statement that pretty much no one outside of this
list would argue with. The fact that he failed to say ?openly available for
bulk download? makes it slightly less ?open? but not so egregiously so that
he must purge the word ?open? (lowercase, not referenced to a specific
definition) from his vocabulary.

The world is large enough for more than One True God. Create your
definition, and gather your adherents, but allow others the use of the term
as well. Thanks again for your thoughtful reply.

"A piece of content or data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse,
and redistribute it ? subject only, at most, to the requirement to
attribute and share-alike"

That describes any data you can get via LibraryCloud's API.

I know that's not exactly what you want the stated definition to mean,
but it is what the definition says.

As for the attempt to enforce a particular and precise definition of a
term already in common (and thus usefully sloppy) use: There's value
in the attempt, so long as it's understood that the precise definition
will only be enforceable and understood within particular contexts.
This list is one of the those contexts for "open."

Access restrictions of this nature generally are not related to  
openness but to system load. Nearly every system that has powerful  
APIs implements some limits to keep API requests from bringing down  
the system. It's a common courtesy to make contact with system folks  
if you are considering doing something that might put a load on their  
system, like downloading large amounts of data. I've watched many  
systems teams negotiate frequencies (one-second intervals) or times  
(over-night) to help users get what they need without damaging the  
service to others. Another option is for systems that anticipate  
frequent requests for "everything" to provide dumps. I see a lot of  
willingness to accommodate a variety of needs on the part of users.

This is one of the things I think we need to address. Unfortunately there
are other reasons for restriction - By downloading 20 items (sic) from a
well known publisher (to whom we paid a subscription) our University was cut
off for apparent attempt to steal content (not because we were overloading
their server). There are many, many sites who restrict use to a small
fraction of their content. You can have 0.0001 of the Cambridge
Crystallographic Database content "for free" - and I am challenging this -
given it is freely contributed by academics - see my blog. You can use <
100K of the 30,000K CAS identifiers (0.003).

If a site wishes its material to be downloaded then we should jointly
develop methods for downloading it (perhaps including mirrors). If it wishes
to control the practice and finance of a community then I personally will
challenge it, especially if the data was effectively provided by the
community.

Message-ID: <CAE9vqEEpLOMLLFJi=1MA3nUSFz+evTSE0P6Br4S0He3kTHgDeQ@mail.gmail.com>

Like the XKCD cartoon about standards (http://xkcd.com/927/), it's
pretty clear that the pace of creation of new bibliographic databases
and services isn't going to abate any time soon as people create new
"one true unifying bibliographic database" instances.  Open Library,
Wikipedia, national libraries, Freebase, OCLC, etc will all have one
page per book, modulo duplicates, omissions, errors, and differences
in focus.

As people grab one-time database dumps and republish them,
disconnected from their original source and without any provenance,
the problem will be compounded.

How do we move from a static set of dumps to a dynamic set of update
streams that enable a vibrant ecosystem of cooperatively cataloged
entities?  A centralized OCLC-based monopoly is one solution, but not
a good one, in my opinion.

Is anyone working on enabling such a set of federated catalogs?  Would
anyone like to?

Tom

That is good news. Does it also mean "you can download as much data as you
like under those conditions"? [subject to consideration to the server] Or
that there is a limit?

I don't understand this sentence. Does it mean that I have misinterpreted
OKD? Or that LibraryCloud API is not OKD-compliant?

The critical question is what you are legally allowed to do. Nothing
overrides the law (although it differs by domain). Licences are legal
documents. They are useful but very blunt.

OSI-compliant codes all have their licences which are legal documents. If
you break those contracts you may be pursued by lawyers. The OSI declaration
effectively says "there are a very wide range of cases wher you can re-use
this code without worrying about minute details of the licence". Yes, I have
been through detailed licence stuff, including negotiations with FSF and
Microsoft so I understand that details can matter. But to a first
approximation an OSI-licence makes a large number of actions clear.

In contrast saying that Harvard API makes things "open" in some undefined
sense gives me no useful information. There are people/organizations who use
"open" to describe their materials who will sue you for ANY redistribution.
One well-known supplier of library systems announced an "Open API". I asked
them if I was allowed to publish their API. No, it was strictly confidential
and anyone who did would be subject to legal action. Here "Open" seemed to
mean "privately documented". Or perhaps it was simply a marketing term, such
as "healthy".

I have been urging the OA community to label their material better and am
glad to see that after ten years they have adopted "gratis" and "libre". In
my view "libre" is more or less synonymous with OKD. I cannot see
libre-with-conditions attatched.

And remember that this is NOT an academic debate. By assuming "open" is
useful you could be paying for a product that you will be sued if you re-use
it.  The solution of requiring everyone to read every licence in detail is
no solution. That is why the OSI and the OKF have spent a lot of time
reading licences and declaring them as compliant or not-compliant. IMO
that's a considerable step forward. It's not religion, it's pragmatism.

For now, there is a limit on the number of queries per day. So, no, it
does not mean "you can download as much data as you like under those
conditions," which means LibraryCloud fails the Access requirement of
the Open Knowledge Definition.

Neither. LibraryCloud meets the requirement stated in the snippet you
referenced. LibraryCloud fails a different OKD criterion.

I hope it is now clear the senses in which LibraryCloud is and is not
open: I believe in
all ways except the OKD's first criterion. The LibraryCloud group would love
to be able to open it all ways, but...

Running for the plane...

But we do need metadata for rights in order to do that. I did a rights  
metadata schema for the University of California some years ago,  
although it may be too complex (it was designed to also meet the needs  
of archives). DC has a rights field that is very simple - it would be  
good, though, to define a set of values. Does anyone know of a rights  
vocabulary we could use?

I think we need this rapidly. There is also an argument for a vocabulary of
values, e.g.
licence = CC0

where each of these could be a URI.

Given the previous discussion I think licences would be a good place to
start. They are neecessary if not sufficient.

Have to say I have a massive amount of sympathy with this point of
view. It does often worry me that projects like this have pushed back,
rather than advanced, the cause of openly sharing standardised
bibliographic info.

No easy solutions here, but certainly very interested to contribute to
anything that might emerge from this.

HI Tom,

I have been working a bit with Rufus Pollock, Richard Jones, Jim
Pitman and Peter Murray-Rust on the BibServer code, we have a
prototype up at bibsoup.net. We are attempting to secure funding to
work on this for a year. The aim is to build a system where
individuals and small groups can easily upload their own collections,
however the same software can also handle larger collections. Ideally
I would like to populate it with large collections as well as enabling
small groups to do their thing, and for those large collections to be
easily updateable by their sources - either by direct management or by
access via API. The BibServer software is being built on
elasticsearch, and there is no reason why we and others could not run
multiple instances of these and share data between them.

We need to do a bit of work on agreeing the underlying format - we are
working with JSON, and specifying a BibJSON - the idea for now being
that it handles what you would usually find in bibtex, but should be
extensible. Further input into this would be appreciated! If anyone
else is interested in helping out with BibJSON, pleases let me know.
But I should point out, our core aim is simplicity and usability by
typical end users.


Mark

  I am as disappointed as you are Klaus. The reading software
  is slow and I can't afford a very fast machine.

  I am still reading BASE. I am still not done restructuring AGRIS. I
  did not know it would take so much time ;-(. When I am done, I will
  read a new version of OpenLibrary data that I did in August after
  reading your original missive.  I don't want to read three

  consider doing so. Actually I am running an update of the

  You mean this?

http://www.d-nb.de/standardisierung/normdateien/pnd.htm

  I don't see where this data is available. Even if it were I am not
  sure if there is bibliographic information available that I can use.

  I can add a field in AuthorClaim where people can add the PND id
  that they may know, but it is useless if I can't get access to some
  more data about them from the PND.

Maybe this can be of help:
<https://wiki.d-nb.de/display/LDS/Dokumentation+des+Linked+Data+Services+der+DNB>

The data is right now published under a non-commercial licence. I'm still convinced that the DNB will change its mind sooner or later.

Hello,

I just want to point to Peter's blog post which was triggered by and
references the "open" discussion:

http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/09/15/open-api-or-glorious-api/

Thank you, Peter, couldn't agree more with you.

I myself am very grateful for the OKFN having developed the Open
Knowledge Definition and find it very important in creating a
knowledge ecology where the different parts are legally compatible,
combinable and mixable. Open W3C standards for Linked Data might bring
the corresponding technical compatibility in the future...

All the best
Adrian

There is some of this in the CC machine readable stuff, for describing
the nature of the licenses, the terms, who must be attributed when,
etc., sufficient that you could say that their standard licenses are
just different configurations of these primitives.

I haven't looked very closely at it, and this starts to get into
things like modelling legal documents, agreements, legislation,
contracts, etc. if you look at it too closely and then generalise.

And indeed these days it is often forgotten that the whole "open" (as
in "open source") discourse to a large extent has its roots in trying
to balance the free software world with the investment banking
(intellectual property rent capture) world during the dot-com boom by
introducing "open" as a less militant and principled version of
free/libre that could, in the limit, be interpreted as "non-free" or
"closed" by a skilled rhetoretician or marketeer.

Or that's one interpretation of what happened, anyways :)

Yes, it is very complex. When I was doing the rights metadata work at  
the U of California, I ended up providing a way to store the relevant  
information that supports a copyright determination - like copyright  
holder, author (because you need to know if the author is dead or  
alive, even if they are not the copyright holder), jurisdiction (the  
rules are different in different countries), contact information, etc.  
If the author has assigned a license to their work, like a CC license,  
then that would be a key piece of information.

What you cannot do, however, is determine what the copyright status  
is, at least not if you are not absolutely sure.

The work I did before on this is here:

http://www.cdlib.org/groups/rmg/

The users guidelines document explains things best:
http://www.cdlib.org/groups/rmg/docs/copyrightMD_user_guidelines.pdf

Some of it may not be relevant to all situations; as I said before,  
this had to also cover archives of papers, etc.

As a long time software engineer, product manager, and intellectual
property rights enthusiast, this is very much at odds with my
experience.

If a team member came to me in my role as a project leader or product
manager and said "Can I incorporate this OSI-licensed software in our
project?," I would have zero information on which to base a decision.
The only way I'd be able to render a decision without additional
information (ie the actual license being used), would be if the
project was already using the most restrictive OSI-approved license
(AGPL v3).  In any other case, I'd need to know the actual license
being used.  And, honestly, even if the licenses were compatible, I'd
still go and check the provenance of all the included
libraries/components/etc to make sure that they had compatible
licenses to.  There are far too many cases where people are already
violating the license of some included component.

The clarity and value comes from having a (relatively) short list of
standardized licenses.  Once you've read and understood a license, you
don't need to go back and re-read it every time you encounter it.
Since the license texts are copyrighted, you can also be (relatively)
confident that no one has made a small but significant change to it.

If you look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_software_licenses
you'll see that OSI is just one of the organizations that expresses
approval or disapproval of open/free software licenses (and you'll
also see the complexity of the compatibility situation).

About the only place I know of where the phrase "OSI-approved license"
actually has meaning is things like code repositories (Google Code,
SourceForge, Tigris) which are restricted to that set of licenses.

Hi,

I'm not currently a member of any okfn open-bibliography working group but I
believe this is an important issue that could be of interest to people on
this list.

I wonder if you've seen any of the coverage of the Author's Guild vs the
HathiTrust case (in case not there is a round up of it here:
http://chrisbourg.wordpress.com/2011/09/15/round-up-on-authors-guild-v-hathitrust/)?
The AG, by identifying candidates that should not be considered as potential
orphan works, have been attempting to show that the HathiTrust's process of
identifying orphan works is not fulfilling it's due diligence as effectively
as it should:

such this represents a serious threat to any efforts intended to address the
problem of orphaned works. The British Library estimates that about 40% of
in-copyright works are orphaned and so the issue for scholarship is acute
http://pressandpolicy.bl.uk/content/default.aspx?NewsAreaID=316

As pointed out here:
http://blog.authorsguild.org/2011/09/14/orphan-row-now-its-your-turn/#comment-310566511
the
efforts the AG are going to are actually showing that the system works (when
you have enough eyes, of course - as they now do) but it could do with some
improvement. The titles they've identified so far have been removed from the
candidates list which is given here
http://orphanworks.hathitrust.org/Search/Home?page=1&use_dismax=1 and
reproduced on their blog that I linked to above.

I'm just wondering if there's any mileage in learning from the successes of
this crowdsourcing effort and using it to compile a more effective set of
tools for working out if a work is truly an orphan work, certainly one
better than the HathiTrust have outlined:
http://www.lib.umich.edu/orphan-works/documentation In particular the
sources that those helping with the current crowdsourcing effort are using
seem to speed up the process considerably. Might it be useful to set up an
EtherPad to help compile this information? Would you know of anyone who
might like to help crowdsourcing rights holders, crowdsourcing the process
or who might benefit from having information about these resources?

Best regards,
Dan.
