Subject: [open-bibliography] This month's virtual meeting
Message-ID: <CAOtd05GGuUMK42s5oXjWA1QZyvMLBZRF_2OEbfWbbMCr+3OObQ@mail.gmail.com>

I will be on holidays next week so that there won't be a virtual
meeting. I propose skipping the meeting completely this month and meet
again on September 3rd.

If anybody has something exciting to share this month we might as well
meet on August 13th...

Subject: [open-bibliography] Wikimedia project for creating open
	bibliographic data
Message-ID: <CAOtd05HCPh_CH7i2GF_z9TOFtryt7zEmjnB8rdtwoP4p0Bf-cw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Wikimedia started an interesting project to promote the creation of
open bibliographic data: the "Massively-Multiplayer Online
Bibliography (MMOB)" [1].

Here's the summary from the wikipage:

"Massively-Multiplayer Online Bibliography (MMOB) is the name for a
series of crowdsourcing projects to perform significant feats of
online bibliography in a fun, collaborative, and principled way, that
would be useful to everyone and acceptable to professionals. It will
rely on volunteer labor, free software, and open Web standards."

I guess, there are some people on this list who are interested in
participating. So, just sign up on the wikipage.

- Adrian

P.S.: I will ask Asaf Bartov [2] - who apparently started this - if
he'd like to give some more information about the projects on
openbiblio.net.

Hi, everyone.

First of all, an important clarification: While I work for the Wikimedia
Foundation, this is _not_ a Foundation, or even a Wikimedia, initiative.  I
just put up that page on the Wikimedia Meta-wiki as a natural brainstorming
space, and because I am personally a longtime Wikimedia volunteer and think
the Wikimedia community is a natural community to take part, but this is
(so far!) only a personal initiative, in my capacity as library metadata
geek, hacker, and digital librarian (all volunteer roles).

I do hope lots of Wikimedians and others join, and the sign-ups on the wiki
page[1] so far are inspiring!  Thank you! :)

Since this was posted, I have elaborated the proposal a bit (still on the
same wiki page) and added a concrete example, and have also answered some
questions on the "Discussion" page behind it[2].  Please do take a(nother)
look!

I would be delighted to discuss collaboration with absolutely anyone
working on open bibliography compatible with my basic terms (primarily
volunteer labor, free software, open Web standards).  I'd like to
centralize discussion though, so if at all possible, let's keep refining
the idea on the Meta page[1] and discussion on its talk page[2].  If for
some reason you find you can't contribute there, go ahead and contribute on
this list.  I'd appreciate an explicit CC to ensure I see this, as I handle
huge amounts of e-mail.

Thanks,

   Asaf

 Developing Countries and Low-Resource Conditions
Message-ID: <CAP884EwLauSJQ4QkFp+hGGbMPWy+QXJHLKCfopONGtm9TrA+bA@mail.gmail.com>

***Please excuse the cross-posting***

===============================================================
NISO/DCMI Webinar: Implementing Linked Data in Developing Countries and
Low-Resource Conditions
PRESENTER: Johannes Keizer & Caterina Caracciolo

DATE: September 25, 2013
TIME: 1:00pm - 2:30pm Eastern (17:00-18:30 UTC) World Clock:
http://bit.ly/18LAQwh
INFORMATION & REGISTRATION:
http://www.niso.org/news/events/2013/dcmi/developing/
===============================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR:

Open data is a crucial prerequisite for inventing and disseminating the
innovative practices needed for agricultural development. To be usable,
data must not just be open in principle -- i.e., covered by licenses that
allow re-use. Data must also be published in a technical form that allows
it to be integrated into a wide range of applications.

This webinar describes the technical solutions adopted by a widely diverse
global network of agricultural research institutes for publishing research
results. The talk focuses on AGRIS, a central and widely-used resource
linking agricultural datasets for easy consumption, and AgriDrupal, an
adaptation of the popular, open-source content management system Drupal
optimized for producing and consuming linked datasets.

Agricultural research institutes in developing countries share many of the
constraints faced by libraries and other documentation centers, and not
just in developing countries: institutions are expected to expose their
information on the Web in a re-usable form with shoestring budgets and with
technical staff working in local languages and continually lured by
higher-paying work in the private sector. Technical solutions must be easy
to adopt and freely available. The webinar will be of interest to any
institution seeking ways to publish and curate data in the Linked Data
cloud.

ABOUT THE SPEAKERS:

Johannes Keizer has worked for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations (FAO) since 1998, primarily as head of the FAO documentation
group. The bibliographic database AGRIS and the multilingual concept scheme
AGROVOC were completely remodeled under his leadership. In the Office of
Knowledge Exchange, Research and Extensions, he heads a staff of 20 -- the
AIMS (Agricultural Information Management Standards and Services) team --
which provides standards, tools, and advice for FAO stakeholders. The AIMS
Team provides the technical backbone for the global Coherence in
Information forAgricultural Research for Development (CIARD) Initiative.
Through EC framework projects such as NeON, D2Science, and agINFRA, the
AIMS Team has channeled the results of innovative European research into
the international work of FAO to combat hunger and poverty in the world.

Caterina Caracciolo is senior information specialist at the FAO. After
working at the National Council of Research (CNR) in Pisa, she joined FAO
in 2006. Since then, she has worked on various aspects related to
information management and sharing, with special focus on metadata. She is
currently involved in the SemaGrow project and part of the AGROVOC
management team at FAO. She holds a PhD in Computer Science from the
University of Amsterdam.

REGISTRATION:

Registration is per site (access for one computer) and closes at 12:00 pm
Eastern (16:00 UTC) on September 25, 2013. Discounts are available for NISO
and DCMI members and students.

NISO/DCMI are holding six joint webinars in 2013. Register for three and
receive the 4th for free.
