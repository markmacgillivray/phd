Hi all,

Is there a BibServer instance I could point at which is likely to
contain the kind of references a scholar in the humanities would wish
to use as citations? I'm thinking of philosophy in particular but a
broader index would be fine.

OCLC later released a statement that there won't be a data dump of the
ODC-by-licensed data for what they describe as technical reasons.

Peter, I assume that the "technical difficulty" is the size of the 
database -- something on the order of 180 million bibliographic records. 
... Ah, no, I just looked it up in their annual report:
235,822,950 records, of which 189,421,960 are for books. And that's from 
a year ago.

It would be very interesting to be able to slice-n-dice that database, 
which, perhaps except for the secret database that Google holds, is the 
largest bibliographic database in the world. For example, their records 
for some less-populous languages may constitute a more complete 
bibliography of the writings of that culture than even the relevant 
national library has.

I plan to write to some of the OCLC folks and ask if they will be 
setting up the needed index to encourage the re-spidering of this data 
by the major search engines. If so, I wonder if those search engines 
then can become an entry point to the data. I also have not seen mention 
of a SPARQL end point for searching the database, but I probably haven't 
encountered all of the technical information.

And I hope also by US (the Open bibliographic community)!

200 million complete records (whatever a complete record is - and that's
part of the problem) in RDF will slaughter most systems (we found that 20
million from Pubmed was a problem). But 20 million in BibJSON with the most
important fields is quite possible. I am not sure  about 200 million - but
it could be possible. Mark McG may comment.

I might upset some purists but I suspect that a collection with the main
details (as we have listed in the Open Bibliographic Principles - author,
data, publisher, title) coukld be extremely valuable for a very wide range
of people who currently don't use bibliography at all. It might not be full
enough for library management, but it would do very well for
undergraduates, hobbyists, citation lists in articles, and Wikipedia, etc.

If they expose an API then it should be possible to distribute the load of
extracting the metadata.

Of course there is always a problem in making sure this info is up-to-date
but this is an excellent place to start deploying such systems.

On the assumption that OCLC want to world to have the totality of their
data and are looking for suggestions as to how to make that happen, I thank
them.

The records themselves are not huge, at least not in the native MARC 
format -- they tend to be in the 1K-1.5K range, and by ignoring some of 
the more obscure data would be smaller - perhaps even half that amount. 
It's the sheer number of fields that I think becomes an issue, not so 
much their size. I would guess at an average of 10 fields per record, 
although that depends on how you break out the data (e.g. if published 
date is considered a separate field or part of the same string with the 
publisher name).

Note that OCLC *does* have an API for worldcat:
   http://www.oclc.org/worldcatapi/default.htm

I couldn't get through all of the legal jargon to figure out if 1) one 
has to be an OCLC member and 2) what uses were allowed. A non-jargon'd 
explanation would be of great benefit.

This newly announced function, though, is not aimed at API-type 
extraction from the database but instead serves the functions addressed 
by schema.org, which is improved search engine access. If 
Google/Bing/Yahoo do indexing on schema.org fields we should be able to 
actually do an author or title search in Google rather than the 
scattershot keyword search that exists today.

Message-ID: <CABPM+wr0L8_euQETvK8MVyEM8kJ-e_EL-egum7L2d5gyTUd9Og@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

Just a reminder that the next Open Science hackday will be taking place in
a couple of weeks and it would be great to see some of you in person or
online! Please sign up as soon as you can for numbers and so we can see
what interesting projects people are interested in working on.

When: Saturday 7 July 2012, 1000-1700 UTC+1
Where: Centre for Creative Collaboration (
http://www.creativecollaboration.org.uk/ ), London
OR
OKFN IRC channel (#okfn on irc.oftc.net and full details of how to connect
(including via a web browser) can be found at: http://okfn.org/contact/)

Sign up: http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7

Our last outing to the Barbican saw a small but dedicated group working on
projects as diverse as services for open access policies, extracting
phylogenetic tree information from PDFs, storing crowdsourced data in CKAN
and more. This time we're going to be bigger and better with a dedicated
space which will hopefully be filled by YOU.

If you'd like to come along, please add yourself to the Etherpad
http://okfnpad.org/sciencewg-hackday-jul7 and if you have a specific idea
you'd like to work on, add that too and you'll have a couple of minutes at
the start of the hackday to tell everyone about it so we can link you up
with people who'd like to help.

You don't need to have an idea for anything to work on or even any coding
skills to join, there are plenty of opportunities to get stuck in with
other people's projects and many non-technical tasks, especially if you
like writing or design.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask and I look forward to
seeing many of you on 7 July!

Jenny

That's certainly what the BL did - albeit on a much smaller DB:

<http://datahub.io/dataset/bluk-bnb>

I also wonder if there is any way to extract a core dataset -- e.g. all books.

My key driver is to be able to *build our own* information systems rather
than relying on Google/Bing/Yahoo. The more this happens, the more
libraries become marginalised. I don't want Google to "do chemistry" - it
won't.

If the result of this is that we transfer one walled garden (OCLC) to
another (GBY) then we haven't gained much.

Hate to sound like a broken record :D but OAI is a perfectly good protocol
for synchronizing large quantities of discrete metadata like bib records.
It's one way to address the stream-of-constant-updates problem and I'd much
rather have an OAI endpoint than a massive datafile any day. The RDF-ers
amonst you can use OAI-ORE. It's a well understood, easy to implement,
-standard- mechanism for this problem... Yet it seems so unpopular, and I
can't for the life of me figure out why :D

Hi All,

(Apologies for cross-posting)

Tom Oinn has been busy this week integrating Bib Sever facet view with
TEXTUS. The results are looking good, even if they're still a bit rough
round the edges. You can check out what's been done so far by going to
http://beta.openphilosophy.org, logging in, uploading a text and going to
the Accept/Reject tab where you will have option to manually input
bibliographic information or search an existing collection of Bibsoup
records.

Two of the key pieces of functionality this will give us is to:

(a) Associate Bib JSON records found in a Bibsoup with a text you are
importing. A great effect of this will be the re-association of high
quality metadata with text from places like Project Gutenberg where
metadata tends to be lost;
(b) Annotate a chunk of text with a reference to a Bib JSON object that
refers to a text that is inside or outside of TEXTUS

Currently TEXTUS is pointing to a BIbsoup that contains no relevant
data. In order to really make this great part of TEXTUS work, we need to
start building a humanities specific Bibsoup that contains as many
references as possible that people are likely to want to refer to when
working with texts in a given instance of TEXTUS such as OpenPhilosophy.org
or OpenLiterature.org .

I'm aware that we now have some massive openly licensed MARC dumps from
places like the Harvard Library on the Data Hub -- but has anyone begun
extracting humanities specific bibliographic references and populating a
Bib Server instance for them?

If not, then this is something I would like to start doing in the near
future. Perhaps asking some of the Philosophy Libraries we are currently in
touch with if they would allows us to use their bibliographic records to
kick start our TEXTUS Bib Server instance and make it immediately useful to
those who will be working with OpenPhilosophy.org.

Cheers,
Sam

  OAI-PMH is compliated, it has features nobody uses... It creates work
  for humans that machines would be better at. 

  I prefer plain files and ftp or better rsync.

The main problem is that it's an "academic-only" format. That means its use
depends on support *and development*  by the academic community whereas
other methods such as rsync, RESTful methods, RSS, etc are in widespread
use. There isn't anything specific that academics need over the rest of the
world.

But having said that IF OCLC expose OAI-PMH then I am sure it can be
incrementally downloaded. With these endpoints the main problem is knowing
what is *in* the repo and ho far through you have got.

But do OCLC have an Open OAI endpoint?

That's the key - as long as OCLC can find a clear way to say what version
the repo is at and/or (preferably) what has changed since, then we are
fine. If they want to throw more resources at it and run a service like an
AtomPub instance or OAI-PMH, then so much the better.

Either service relies on the knowledge of what has changed since 'x' time -
without that, it will be a very computationally painful thing to reverse
engineer.

Hmm, Etienne has been working on putting up an instance that contains
multiple national bibliographies. Perhaps that would contain something of
interest to humanities people? Apart from that, we do not yet have any
specific humanities datasets, but we could easily put one up if anyone has
such a collection they would like us to use.

Hi Sam, Etienne has been working with the national bibliographies and is
putting them up in a large index soon, so that may be useful.

If any of your contacts have specific collections they would like to see in
bibsoup, we could certainly get them in there too.

I think also Ed / Etienne was looking at the Harvard data... not sure what
has been done with it yet though.

Tom and I will be up in Cambridge doing a TEXTUS workshop at the philosophy library there.

I would be keen to see if they would be interested in sharing the data they have in their own collection.

Another option could be to parse some of the larger data dumps we now see on The Data Hub for relevant material. The success of this would I guess depend on their being a topic field.

This discussion is going forward on the presumption that OCLC will allow 
significantly large downloads to the general public. I may have missed 
some announcement, but I am not sure that is the case. Before 
speculating further it might be good to clarify that point.

To reiterate, this most recent announcement relates to the addition of 
data to WorldCat displays for search engine optimization. My 
understanding is that OCLC is open to search engines, and they do 
provide a sitemap:

http://www.worldcat.org/libraries/sitemap_index.xml

Beyond that it's greek to me, but perhaps someone on this list can 
figure out what is and isn't possible.

I suggest you approach David Bourget http://www.dbourget.com/  maintainer of http://philpapers.org/ for permission
to run a BibServer instance over PhilPapers data:
"PhilPapers is a comprehensive directory of online philosophical articles and books by academic philosophers. 
We monitor journals in many areas of philosophy, as well as archives and personal pages. 
We also accept articles directly from users, who can provide links or upload copies."

My point is simple:

* if someone says that their data is made available under an Open Database
licence the absolute implication is that - barring technical aspects - all
the data can be accessed. If this is not the case they have to say: "the
following subset is made available as Open Data".

Open to search engines but not open to you and me is NOT OPEN.

I see many cases of the word "Open" that includes untenable restrictions.
Maybe I am prejudging here - but I am outlining what I think are absolutes.

Publishing the whole data dump should not be a big technical problem
(apart from reserving disk space for it).

It would not be much larger than the billion triple dataset (
http://km.aifb.kit.edu/projects/btc-2011/ ) consisting of ~2bn
triples, which archived is ~20Gb (for users' convenience it is divided
into ~200 gzipped N-triples files).

Ability to process such a large dataset is another question. If the
full dump is available, then other volunteers could "digest" the
dataset and provide fellow open data users with smaller, easier-to-use
subsets. This slicing can be done using a regular home computer
provided that ntriples files are processed "on-the-fly". Thus OCLC
would shift the work of slicing the dataset into the hands of
volunteers and would only need to provide raw data.

Others could provide SPARQL interfaces [to the full dataset or slices
of it] though that would require a lot more resources. Probably can be
done by research centres or companies that develop RDF data stores.

Technical questions that remain are:
1) converting data into a format that is convenient for data dumps
2) providing updates (dumps with new/changed records?)

P.S. Looks like N-triples is the format of choice when providing RDF data dumps.

Hi Sam,

Philpapers has an OAI-PMH interface onto user-uploaded content, but does
not share any other info due to licensing restrictions. However, at least
some of their content is open access, and their terms and conditions
restrict use for things like sale and so on.

If you contact David as Jim suggests, and find out if they would be willing
to provide a dump of all or some of their data, we could build a bibsoup
collection out of it and use it for your textus demos. Also, I note on
their API page that they say a JSON API is coming soon - so if we can get
them interested by offering bibsoup functionality on their pages, which
would give them a JSON interface, then all the better.

Mark

Hi Sam

An option is to add your own collection of humanities texts to
BibSoup, which could then be used to link to from TEXTUS. Here is a
blog posting showing how to create a BibSoup collection from a
Wikipedia search as a starting point.
http://openbiblio.net/2012/06/27/using-wikipedia-to-build-a-philosophy-or-other-sort-of-collection-in-bibsoup/

Once you have a collection with some results, you can also download
the BibJSON to your local machine and edit it in yout favourite text
editor, and possible re-upload your edited version to BibSoup again.
You can either download the BibJSON for an entire collection from the
link in the top-right hand corner of a collection view (Download as
BibJSON) or by viewing the raw data for an upload ticket tfrom the
ticket overview screen. The ticket overview can be seen on the
/ticket/ URL on a BibServer or from the button on the Upload form.

cheers,

Etienne Posthumus
