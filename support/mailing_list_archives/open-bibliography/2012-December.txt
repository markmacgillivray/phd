Subject: [open-bibliography] Virtual Meeting to be postponed
Message-ID: <CAOtd05Hq3R99LowNoBMt7N6AnFQmTKdZeQXYpDungSemgD+bUg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

today the group's monthly virtual meeting should take place.
Unfortunately, I am sick and won't be able to host the meeting today.

I propose postponing the meeting to next Tuesday, December 11th, 16:00
GMT (see http://is.gd/openbibliomeeting27 for your local time). As
usual, I've set up an etherpad for writing up the agenda:
http://okfnpad.org/27th-open-bibliography-meeting

All the best
Adrian

As by now my partner is sick, I will have to fetch the children this
afternoon and - again - won't be able to host the call.

Karen suggested another day, but I am not able to have the meeting on
another day before christmas. So we the next meeting will take place
next year, on 8th of January. I'll update the etherpad accordingly.

All the best
Adrian

Subject: [open-bibliography] Simple bibliography
Message-ID: <20121212135112.252070@gmx.com>

Dear all,

We are trying to set up an online bibliography for the Converting the Isle project (http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/conversion/) and would like it to be easy to format, update, search by tags etc.
Does anyone have any advice on a system for this?
Zotero seems like the way to go as the use-case is quite simple. How does eg. the HTML export from Zotero shape up?
I had a look at bibserver but it seems far too heavyweight and couldn't find a way to edit existing collections, only add new ones.

Anyone done similar?

Thanks,
Jack

Jack, what types of materials will have in your bibliography? e.g. 
books, articles, photographs? Have you looked at Mendeley, which can 
create an HTML page (but I haven't played with it much).

Mendeley is another reference/bibliography manager which is popular.  There
are a number of comparisons of Zotero vs Mendeley (and often EndNote)
around the web, but they tend to get dated as the packages evolve.  Here's
one: http://hlwiki.slais.ubc.ca/index.php/Zotero_vs._Mendeley but since it
was written Zotero has added duplicate detection/merging and Mendeley has
added support for CSL so you can create your own citation styles (or better
yet, reuse someone elses).
