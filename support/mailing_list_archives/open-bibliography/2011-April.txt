DCMI EXTENDS DC-2011 SUBMISSION DEADLINE to 30 APRIL 2011

=================================================
DC-2011 Call for Papers
=================================================

International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications:
"Metadata Harmonization: Bridging Languages of Description"

21-23 September 2011, The Hague, Netherlands

-------------------------------------------------
DEADLINES & IMPORTANT DATES:
Submission Deadline EXTENSION: 30 April 2011
Author Notification: 18 June 2011
Final Copy: 23 July 2011

Access to Author Guidelines and the submission process are available at the conference website (http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2011) and from links in the online Call of Papers at http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/dc-2011/schedConf/cfp.
-------------------------------------------------

Metadata is an increasingly central tool in the current web environment, enabling large-scale, distributed management of resources.  Recent years has seen a growth in interaction between previously relatively isolated metadata communities, driven by the need for cross-domain collaboration and exchange.  However, metadata standards have not been able to meet the needs of interoperability between independent standardization communities.  For this reason the notion of metadata harmonization, defined as interoperability of combinations of metadata specifications, has arisen as a core issue for the future of web-based metadata. Resting at the heart of application profiles, metadata harmonization presents a little understood, but critical challenge in design of languages of description.  DC-2011 will explore the conceptual and practical issues of design when the language solution calls for cross-fertilization from different metadata specifications.

Beyond the conference theme, papers, reports, and poster submissions are welcome on a wide range of metadata topics, such as:

-- Metadata principles, guidelines, and best practices
-- Metadata quality (methods, tools, and practices)
-- Conceptual models and frameworks (e.g., RDF, DCAM, OAIS)
-- Application profiles
-- Metadata generation (methods, tools, and practices)
-- Metadata interoperability across domains, languages,
    time, structures, and scales.
-- Cross-domain metadata uses (e.g., recordkeeping, preservation,
    curation, institutional repositories, publishing)
-- Domain metadata (e.g., for corporations, cultural memory
    institutions, education, government, and scientific fields)
-- Bibliographic standards (e.g., RDA, FRBR, subject headings)
    as Semantic Web vocabularies
-- Accessibility metadata
-- Metadata for scientific data, e-Science and grid applications
-- Social tagging and user participation in building metadata
-- Usage data (paradata/attention metadata)
-- Knowledge Organization Systems (e.g., ontologies, taxonomies,
    authority files, folksonomies, and thesauri) and Simple Knowledge
    Organization Systems (SKOS)
-- Ontology design and development
-- Integration of metadata and ontologies
-- Search engines and metadata
-- Linked data and the Semantic Web (metadata and applications)
-- Vocabulary registries and registry services

SUBMISSIONS

All submissions for papers, reports, poster abstracts, and community workshop and special session must do so through the DCMI Peer Review System at http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/dc-2011/schedConf/cfp (see submission link at bottom of page).  Author registration with the peer review system and instructions for the submission process appear under the "Information for Authors" link.

-- All submissions must be in English.
-- All submissions will be peer-reviewed by the International Program Committee.

Publication

-- Accepted papers, project reports and poster abstracts will
    be published in the official Conference Proceedings at
    http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/ojs/pubs.
-- Special session and community workshop session abstracts
    will be published in the online conference program.
-- Papers, research reports and poster abstracts must conform
    to the appropriate formatting template available through the
    DCMI Peer Review System.
-- Unless previously arranged, accepted papers, project reports
    and posters must be presented at The Hague by at least one of
    their authors.
-- Submitting authors in all categories must provide basic
    information regarding current professional positions and
    affiliations as a condition of acceptance and publication.

FULL PAPERS (8-10 pages)

Full papers either describe innovative work in detail or provide critical, well-referenced overviews of key developments or good practice in the areas outlined above. Full papers will be assessed using the following criteria:

-- Originality of the approach to the topic and potential for
    implementation
-- Quality of the contribution to the implementation community
-- Significance of the results presented
-- Clarity of presentation

PROJECT REPORTS (4-5 pages)

Project reports describe a specific model, application, or activity in a concise presentation. Project reports will be assessed using the following criteria:

-- Conciseness and completeness of technical description
-- Usability of the technical description by other potential
    implementers
-- Clarity of presentation

POSTERS (1-2 pages)

Posters are for the presentation of projects or research under development or late-breaking results. Poster proposals should consist of a one-two page extended abstract.  Posters will be assessed using the following criteria:

-- Concise statement of research or project goals and milestones
-- Significance of the research or project
-- Framing of key barriers and future research
-- Statement of results and accomplishments
-- Clarity of presentation

One or more sessions will be scheduled for display and discussion of posters at the conference venue.   Instructions on the preparation of the display poster will be forthcoming on the conference website.  Unless otherwise arranged, accepted  posters must be presented at The Hague by at least one of their authors.  However, with prior arrangement, posters abstracts may be included in the published proceedings and presented by means of video ranging from 4-10 minutes in length and uploaded to YouTube with the URL supplied at the time the poster abstract is submitted.

SPECIAL SESSIONS & DCMI COMMUNITY WORKSHOP SESSIONS

Proposals for special sessions and community workshop sessions should be 800-1,200 words in length including a 35-50 word abstract for use in publicizing the session.  Session proposals must identify the:

-- Session conveners
-- Where applicable, categories of target participants
-- Session:
    o Purpose
    o Agenda
    o Activities (including any technical requirements)
    o Ramp-up and follow-through (including after-conference reporting)
    o Workshop session proposals must identify the specific DCMI community
      (see http://www.dublincore.org/groups/#communities)

Conveners of accepted sessions will be expected to work closely with the Workshop Chair to refine, schedule and convene their session. The Workshop Chair, in consultation with the Conference Committee, will review special session proposals.  The Workshop Chair, in consultation with the chairs/co-chairs of the relevant DCMI communities, will review community workshop proposals.  Evaluation criteria for session proposals will be: (1) quality and organization of content, (2) justification of format; (3) evidence of interactivity and participatory approaches; (3) inclusivity/diversity of participation; and (4) the potential of the session to engage the conference participants in general and, for workshop sessions, the community of interest in particular (including any necessary technical outreach beyond the venue (e.g., Skype)).

Dear all,

As you know, we're busily preparing the schedule for this year's OKCon, which is going to be in Berlin on the 31st June and 1st July. We're really excited about this year's event - so much has happened in the last 12 months! We're really hoping you guys will be up for having a meet-up scheduled in, so you can get together face-to-face and chat about the amazing work that you've been doing over the past year and how we can push forward with the next one. Are there times/days which are better or worse for people? 

Also, it would be *fantastic* to have presentations, workshops, discussions or lightening talks from people on this list - there's so much activity in the field, it would be great to get a bit of a taster of all your work.

I've attached a short PDF version of the Call for Participation, and if you haven't already seen it you can check out the full version at 
	
	http://okcon.org/2011/cfp/

The submissions form is at http://okcon.org/2011/submit/

Looking forward to meeting lots of you in Berlin! 

Also registration is open at: registration: http://okcon2011.eventbrite.com/

All the best,
Daniel

Hello,

My name is Lucy Chambers - I am the new Community Coordinator for the
OKF alongside Jonathan Gray. Rufus isn't going to be able to make the
meeting this afternoon, so he wondered whether I could be there
instead?

I'm not familiar with IRC - do I just need to create a username and
log in to be able to chat?

Thank you and hope to speak to you tonight,

Lucy

I have talked with the MS MAS people and I'll be at their virtual meeting
tomorrow. Itcould be important. They would - I think - like to mke data Open
but they have agreements. More tomorrow.

Subject: [open-bibliography] bibliographica and edinburgh science festival
	data
Message-ID: <BANLkTinEGJ-ng6DLbr35BvoS+2FV+qFTyw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This weekend I put up a tool to search Edinburgh International Science
Festival events, and I connected it up to the
bibliographica.org/search which now gives back JSON responses.

This means you can find an event and when you view more info you get
back a relevant reading list - e.g. stuff written by the speakers at
that event, or related to the event theme.

Unfortunately the underlying data was a bit poor, so there are a few
events with no theme or speaker listed, and various other issues. I
have tried to tidy it a fair bit though.

there is a blog post on openbiblio about it:
http://openbiblio.net/2011/04/11/bibliographica-and-edinburgh-international-science-festival/

or go direct to the tool here: http://eisf.cottagelabs.com

This quite nicely shows what useful things we can do with open data -
both from the British Library dataset and from the science festival
data!

I would like to add some swishy graphical stuff too, if i get time.

Message-ID: <BANLkTinN25zR1VTO+Rxdj9Ei5s2KdHHSLw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

The JISC Open Bibliography project is organising an open bibliographic
data workshop on Friday May 6th 2011 at London Knowledge Lab.

The purpose of the workshop is to converge on methods for making
maintenance and use of bibliographic records more interactive and
collaborative. We have listed some suggested areas of work, but would
like to get feedback from the community on the most useful things to
focus on, and to have a wider group attending either in person or
remotely (remote attendance would involve collaborating via etherpads
on work going on in the room).

There is space for about 20 attendees; please read further information
and complete our signup form, indicating whether you would like to
attend in person or remotely. Or if you do not wish to attend but
still want to provide feedback, please do so on the page comments or
on this list.

http://openbiblio.net/openbiblio-workshop

Thank you very much for your support,

Mark MacGillivray

Subject: [open-bibliography] Bibliographic standards for citing versioned
	documents?
Message-ID: <BANLkTik=x5rh3meCPD86Eq-F7bh0-Kn8nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear colleagues,

if a wiki contains information originally published elsewhere, the
question arises how the updated wiki version of such information
should be properly cited. Are there any bibliographic standards for that?

The National Library of Medicine has some guidelines on how to cite
internet resources,
including a section on wikis (cf.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK7266/#A61262 )
but it handles revisions by date and thus ignores that many revisions
may take place during
a day on some wiki pages. It also does not address the issue of how to
cite content that started out
elsewhere and has continued to evolve on a wiki.

The Species ID wiki ( http://www.species-id.net/ ) has recently, in
collaboration with the journals ZooKeys and PhytoKeys as well as the
Plazi repository, imported a number of taxonomic treatments as wiki
pages, and the above-mentioned issue was addressed by incorporating
the generic link to the wiki page into new journal publications, and
providing a suggested citation format on-wiki that includes the
original work along with a permalink to the most recent wiki version
and the wiki contributors until that version.

For some example pages, see
http://species-id.net/wiki/Neobidessodes_darwiniensis or
http://species-id.net/wiki/Sinocallipus_catba .

The publisher's news release on the matter is at
http://www.pensoft.net/news.php?n=53 , and I have commented in my blog
at
http://www.science3point0.com/evomri/2011/04/16/citing-versioned-papers-robots-and-reviewers/
,
touching upon the need for a karma system compatible with
collaboratively updated documents.

Comments and suggestions very welcome.

With my best wishes,

Daniel

Message-ID: <20110421030529.GA6601@openlib.org>


[sent on behalf of the OAI7 Workshop Organising Committee]

OAI7, the 7th Cern Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication,
at http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?ovw=True&confId=103325,
is being held on 22-24 June 2011 in the University of Geneva. OAI
Workshops are *THE* Open Access event in Europe in the year in which
they are held. They bring together a community of librarians, IT
specialists, publishers, funders and researchers and are a real
community occasion. A full programme of papers and posters has been
prepared by the Organising Committee for this event. A new development
for OAI7 is the introduction of a session on Open Access publishing,
the first time this subject has received such treatment at OAI
Workshops. The full programme of Tutorials and Papers can be found at
http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceTimeTable.py?confId=103325#20110622.

Registrations are proceeding apace. We encourage you to register
quickly at
http://indico.cern.ch/confRegistrationFormDisplay.py?confId=103325 to
ensure you have a place at the event. There is a Social Programme to
accompany OAI7, which will include a visit to the Cern Laboratories,
with the opportunity to tour some of the exhibitions there, as well as
a buffet and the now-traditional drinks sharing, where every attender
is invited to bring something to drink and share which represents
their home country. A second social occasion will be the drinks
aperitif on the rooftop of the University buildings, giving panoramic
views across the city.

We look forward to meeting you in Geneva in June.

  It works well here, in my firefox browser. Do others 
  have problems?

  I suspect is a problem with at end. Check your firewall
  to make sure you can reach other ftp servers.

  Well maybe but I am not aware of them. I am sure most
  of the dataset builders would love you to reuse their
  material.

  If you can't access the data via anonymous ftp, and you
  want to use it for a larger project I suggest we try
  rsync with you.

  Cheers,

I just checked with an ancient version of Firefox (3.0.1) on a mac and have no problems
listing the ftp directory or pulling over the files.

Sure, but:

-- who is maintaining this list? How credibly for how long?
-- where can users pick up a machine-readable export of this list? Or are users expected to scrape the html?
-- how to contribute additional items?
-- why is CC BY being used rather than CC0 for a list of public domain facts (who has published what data with what license where?)

Some missing sites are Krichel's 3lib, RePEc, arXiv API, Mendeley, BibSonomy, bibkn.org, ....
And what about the new Xref exposure of its 46M records one by one by API? 
http://www.crossref.org/CrossTech/2011/04/content_negotiation_for_crossr.html
Is this open data?

I would hope that all of these (and more) are listed as part of the
CKAN bibliographic data group:

http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic

This lives at the OKF, we plan to maintain it in perpetuity, it is
machine readable, anyone can contribute to it, and it is openly
licensed.

The JISC OBD list is nice for a quick, human-readable overview though
- which is why I sent it here! :-)

Me too, and this hope might be realized if the resources used to maintain the JISC list
were directed towards the CKAN list and the JISC list then derived from the CKAN list by script,
rather than JISC maintaining its own list with an unsuitable license (CC BY).

Excellent.  

> The JISC OBD list is nice for a quick, human-readable overview though

Sure, but I am concerned about the waste of resources to maintain such a list separately from CKAN.
Is the data on the JISC  list entirely derived from the CKAN data?
If so, why not properly acknowledge this to promote CKAN?
And if not, how to get the additional information back to CKAN?
It does not seem useful to be promoting two overlapping lists in this space.
I would rather see all such efforts directed to promoting CKAN.

My questions:

remain to stimulate discussion on the list.
