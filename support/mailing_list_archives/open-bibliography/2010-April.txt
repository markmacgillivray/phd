Dear Christopher,

Reading your remark "but the license will not appear until they pick 
one.", I am reminded of the very nice OpenDOAR Policies Tool interface 
(http://www.opendoar.org/tools/en/policies.php) provided by Peter 
Millington to permit users to choose access policies for their 
repositories, of which I am sure you are aware. 

Last August I wrote to Peter about extending the OpenDOAR Policy Tool 
for assigning RDF metadata according to Science Commons data licences.  
He replied:

    Your proposed adaptation of the /Open/DOAR Policy Tool for licenses
    for depositing data in open access repositories is interesting
    and potentially of more general benefit to /Open/DOAR users. I would
    be happy therefore to provide you with the necessary PHP source code
    and advice.

Well, this is not something I am able to do myself, nor have manpower to 
devote to at present, but perhaps you or someone in OKF or CC can accept 
Peter's kind offer and make something of this.

David

I've got 3 cases I need to consider.

First of all is our school RDF (FOAF etc.), 2nd is our school repository 
(bibliographic metadata)

The biggy, however, is that the next release of EPrints will generate 
RDF automatically, and we want to provide clear an easy instructions on 
how to pick a license. Possibly, now I think about it, I might link to a 
page on our wiki so we can alter it any time as we learn.

Most of the OAI stuff which can be configured via this tool is put into 
to the RDF
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/repositoryinfo/RDFXML/ecs.n3?mimetype=text/plain

Perhaps they could add a license picker for metadata in general?

Christopher - we provide user support through our tech team for anyone 
trying to implement Creative Commons licensing via web services. Drop me 
a line if you're interested. We've been getting our services honed 
through a variety of users rolling out CC0, including the Dutch 
Government, and I'd be happy to connect you into that group of users as 
well.

Jonathan Rees is on the list for the Open Biblio Data and can walk you 
through the RDF side of things from a CC perspective. He's a principal 
scientist at Creative Commons and also sits on the Technical 
Architecture Group for the W3C, as well as leading the Shared Names 
project for stable URIs for data and metadata. He is the lead author on 
our recent white paper on publishing data papers.

Nathan Yergler, our CTO, would be the one to help you through 
implementation phases, web services, and so forth. You can also look at 
our developer wiki (http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Developers - note 
the desktop and web application sections, as well as open developer 
challenges) as well if you're interested.

My basic answer is: no, in standard usage, the ODC licenses do not
impose "contract terms" that go beyond copyright *plus* the relevant
data(base) specific IP rights in your jurisdiction (if these differ
from copyright).

This is turning into a bit of FUD thing so it is important to clear it
up! More on this in this recent blog post (see section that is
entitled Contract and the ODbL):

<http://blog.okfn.org/2010/03/25/comments-on-the-panton-principles-and-data-licensing/>

Nothing in the ODbL license in its standard usage will impose
restrictions beyond those in your basic copyright/database law.

Right, you could also use CC-0 or the PDDL [1] to go for a complete
PD-only approach. All of these are good in my view and obviously a
PD-only approach imposes fewer restrictions on users/reusers.

It might be helpful, then, if the ODbL made this clearer up front
in future revisions.   The statement

"[2.2.]c. Contract. This is an agreement between You and the Licensor 
for access to the Database. In return you agree to certain conditions of 
use on this access as outlined in this License."

appears fairly early in the license, and it in itself does
does not appear to be consistent with your statement, as it's
understood in US law.  In particular, simple access to a database
does not normally infringe copyright law in the US.

It looks like section 6 (and 10.4) later walk this back to acknowledging
atandard copyright-law user rights without any restrictions.  But it's
complex enough that I as a non-lawyer can't easily be *positive* it
walks the contract-even-without-infringement implication
of 2.2.c all the way back.  (The folks at Science Commons seem
to doubt this as well, based on their comments at
http://sciencecommons.org/resources/readingroom/comments-on-odbl/
but I can't tell if their comments reflect an earlier draft, or whether
you and they have come to an understanding since.)

As I explained in an earlier email the ODbL is really little different
from e.g. CC licenses in this respect, the ODbL is just being more
explicit about this ...

<quote (from earlier email)>
I'm not sure of the relevance of this comment. Almost all licenses
whether they are normal CC ones for content or Open Data Commons one's
for data have an element of contract in them, at least in common law
jurisdictions. See, for example, this comment from Mia Garlick (who
was CC's general counsel):

http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2006-April/003504.html
</quote>

What do you mean by "simple access to the database" and what exactly
do you mean by "infringe copyright law". In general simple access
won't be an immediate violation if you allow free access in any
jurisdiction. Copying or reusing that data(base) may do ... The US
situation is complex (despite Feist), and the exact status of rights
in a "database" will depend on the degree of "originality" that went
into the construction of the database etc. For more see
<http://www.opendefinition.org/guide/data/>

I've commented on the science commons piece when it was posted last
year here (though not covering the contractual issue):

<http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/odc-discuss/2009-March/000109.html>

On this specific question of contract, my view is what I have
expressed above which is this that ODbL here is little different from
your current application of a CC by-sa: both could be interpreted as
having a contractual component (which the ODbL is explicit about)
while being primarily based on the underlying IP rights.
