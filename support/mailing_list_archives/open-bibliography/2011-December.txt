===============================
DC-2012 Call for Participation
===============================

International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications:
"Metadata for Meeting Global Challenges"

3-7 September 2012, Kuching, Sarawak, Malaysia

Conference Website: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2012

----------------------------------
DEADLINES & IMPORTANT DATES:
Submission Deadline: 23 March 2012
Author Notification: 25 May 2012
Final Copy: 29 June 2012
----------------------------------

DC-2012 will explore the global, national and regional roles of metadata in
addressing global challenges such as food security, the digital divide, and
sustainable development. Metadata plays a significant role globally in
information systems shaping how we know, monitor and change social and
governmental systems affecting everything from the environment, human
rights and justice to education and peace. DC-2012 will bring together in
Kuching the community of metadata scholars and practitioners to engage in
the exchange of knowledge and best practices in developing languages of
description to meet these global challenges.

Beyond the conference theme, papers, reports, and poster submissions are
welcome on a wide range of metadata topics, such as:

-- Metadata principles, guidelines, and best practices
-- Metadata quality (methods, tools, and practices)
-- Conceptual models and frameworks (e.g., RDF, DCAM, OAIS)
-- Application profiles
-- Metadata generation (methods, tools, and practices)
-- Metadata interoperability across domains, languages,
   time, structures, and scales.
-- Cross-domain metadata uses (e.g., recordkeeping, preservation,
   curation, institutional repositories, publishing)
-- Domain metadata (e.g., for corporations, cultural memory
   institutions, education, government, and scientific fields)
-- Bibliographic standards (e.g., RDA, FRBR, subject headings)
   as Semantic Web vocabularies
-- Accessibility metadata
-- Metadata for scientific data, e-Science and grid applications
-- Social tagging and user participation in building metadata
-- Usage data (paradata/attention metadata)
-- Knowledge Organization Systems (e.g., ontologies, taxonomies,
   authority files, folksonomies, and thesauri) and Simple Knowledge
   Organization Systems (SKOS)
-- Ontology design and development
-- Integration of metadata and ontologies
-- Search engines and metadata
-- Linked data and the Semantic Web (metadata and applications)
-- Vocabulary registries and registry services

----------------------------------

Message-ID: <CAOtd05FSBBGAnF61iz4Ck1+YieXrY9dqw-eyXHJLifbw6iTKaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I just posted the good news that the computer science bibliography
DBLP has adopted an open license (ODC-BY) for its 1.8 million records:
http://openbiblio.net/2011/12/09/dblp-releases-its-1-8-million-bibliographic-records-as-open-data/

I already updated the entry on the Data Hub.[1]

@Thomas: You can now resolve the isitopendata enquiry.[2] (Obviously,
only the owner can resolve it, otherwise I'd done it myself.)

Cheers,
Adrian

Excellent! Mark, we should look at importing some or all of DBLP for BibServer display.
I'm particularly interested in the more mathematical/statistical parts.
We could also look at extracting records related to our technical interests like automated record clustering/deduplication.
Karen and Adrian and I agreed at last openbiblio call that we should try to collect and publish knowledge and experience
related to record clustering/deduplication in a wiki or similar setup. Having a list of technical articles
on the topic would be a good start, and that might be extractable from DBLP.
There is a lot of experience in this domain which is not easily accessible.
Suggestions how to collect and organize that experience for the benefit of openbiblio efforts would be much appreciated.

This is brilliant. Thx to all including the Dagstuhl (I was there two years
ago for a bio-ontology meeting - noted the maths library but never thought
twice then as I wasn't into bibliography.

@MarkMacGillivray has made great progress with Bibserver and BibSoup
technology and this is a great resource to feed into the system. @JimPitman
will have a field day

Peter,
The intention was to survey the types of licence used in HYBRID journals
and to allow people to judge whether the licences (and the fees) were
appropriate. It's only a few days old.

We did not add fully Open Access (gold) journals unless someone finds
examples which have CC-NC or even more restrictive examples.

Sage, Springer and others are there because I suspect they have both OA
journals and Hybrids. The comparion of licences and prices is particularly
valuable in these cases.

As I said it's a few days old and if there is material that wrong or
incomplete feel free to edit.

The analysis of "all" journals is a task that we shouldn't expect any
single person to even think about! (there are 26000 journals I think). Ross
has already spent valuable PhD time on this  and deserves huge thanks.

My motivation in suggesting this was that I or OKF could then have clear
evidence to take back to funders and show that their "paid Open Access" was
a substandard product (i.e. did not conform with the BOAI declaration or
with SPARC's present position (I hope I'm right on that)). We would then
urge funders to insist that they require at least CC-BY. My intention was
to get an OKF document that summarised the present position and take it to
funders, government, MPs, etc. When governments are requiring Open data,
why are we accepting less at great cost for science. It's even possible
that if a givernment agency published its own report it would now by CC-BY
but that in a scholarly publication it would tbe restricted to CC-NC by the
publisher.

Note that the US government has always (at least as far as I remember)
required that its publications are Open. Staff in (say) NIH publishing
papers are required to make them open and not to hand over copyright. How
much it actually happens in the pages of the journals I don't know.

Perhaps this is something that the EU could address for its agencies. Or
maybe it takes the same line as the US.

We just shipped Refine 2.5, so now would be a good time to address this if
there's any interest in the OKFN community (or elsewhere).

Another interesting capability might be a Google Refine reconciliation
service backed by BibSoup/BibServer/Bib* so that imported bibliographic
data can be reconciled against existing entitities (journals, authors, etc)
which are already in the database.

I agree with Tom, now would be a good time !

I would happily be the designated BibSoup "Importer" and "Reconciler" guru,
if Tom and Mark want to hack on the tools and reconciliation code.  And I
think Jim liked that idea as well, since he is a bit busy and wanted
someone devoted to doing this kind of work, like me and Tom. :)

This would be great to have extra people working on, I would greatly
appreciate it!

How do you want to go from here? I could be available to talk about it
some time tomorrow via skype if you like.

This is really exciting and important. We are keen that Open Bibliography
is a community of practice. BibSoup deliberately has not "head" or central
control - anyone can set up instances. Problems are resolved by community
discussion. [Of course it will be useful to have some communal indexes]

Subject: [open-bibliography] Compiling licence details for all open access
 journals in UK PubMedCentral (or PMC)
Message-ID: <CABPM+woOp5eLPce6tn_1Cz3Ld4bwvzMxx1z7=emG8Kkf5v_-zg@mail.gmail.com>

I've just had a look at the spreadsheet for the first time since Saturday -
wow! Amazing job Ross!
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtbO6mZEvieCdDFzdkVNQld6Mnc5NEpGWVlRUVhvM3c#gid=0

In terms of completeness, I agree it's really hard to ensure good coverage
of the publishers and we could do with a really good list including
licences to continue with and crowdsource just the more difficult to find
details like author pays charges. Also, from Ross' spreadsheet it looks
like in many cases the licensing is journal rather than publisher specific,
particularly so with the larger publishers. As this all started with a
discussion about articles in UK PubMedCentral, I wonder if we could take
their list of full or partial OA journals, get the license data for OA
articles published in them and then work from there. The way to do this
might be:

a) Ask someone at UK PMC for such a list - any volunteers with contacts?
This is preferable as it avoids a lot of work, but if not possible...

b) Compile a list of journals flagged as open access, then search the
article metadata for a few articles from that journal to find the licences

I've included the open-biblio list for technical advice if this is our only
option! Could we:
1) Take the list of PMC journals flagged as full or partial OA (PMC journal
list with open access indicator field available as CSV here
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/journals/#csvfile, UK PMC here
http://ukpmc.ac.uk/journalList#csvfile, probably as another format
somewhere...)
2) Query the PMC metadata (using the UKPMC-OIA tool) for OA articles (could
limit this to just a few (maybe even a single) records from each journal -
license type is an attribute so could query for license-type="open-access")
3) Extract licensing information (XML attribute
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/dobs.html#dob-license
)
4) Check for consistency (should be the same for all articles within a
journal) and tabulate the results alongside the journal record in the
journal list. We probably don't require all fields but obviously publisher
and others are vital.

We can then add in all of the excellent information Ross has collected
(which probably includes journals not indexed by PMC), which would already
cover a significant chunk

Technical people - is this feasible and is it possible in a short enough
time that it is worth it compared to crowdsourcing more content? This is
not my area of expertise so you may have a much better way of doing it than
the one I suggest above, I just worked backwards from what we want to end
up with.

Interestingly enough, the PMC XML guidance (
http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/publishing/tag-library/) states:
The type of license, for example, ?open-access? for a license permitting
*unrestricted* use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided
the original work is properly cited.
(my emphasis!)

Feel free to assert that this is entirely unecessary, it depends how
complete we want our coverage to be. Being able to generate evidence across
a recognised source of OA material such as PMC or UK PMC could be powerful.
We would need to cover more journals from the physical sciences in addition
to be representative across fields, but Ross has already made great
progress on this.

Indeed!

I added the Beilstein Institute, with two gold OA journals, and the
Molecular Diversity Preservation International, with more than 50 gold
OA journals.

Interesting statement indeed... the unrestricted bit excludes
NC-tained licenses as Open Access...  (or did they misinterpret the
meaning of 'unrestricted' when writing up this statement?)

> Feel free to assert that this is entirely unecessary,

I think the statement is important. I do not know why PMC excludes NC
clauses as Open Access... does anyone?

It is probably important to add the context... this quote is from a
page describing an XML language, not a normative text... the quote in
context can even be interpreted in several ways, one of which is that
the description just describes *one* possibility of an open access
license... (thanx to the person who contacted me off list, to bring
this up!)

This spreadsheet is awesome.  Can I plea for a rearrangement, moving
the brief data columns (specifically, L "price range" and N
"journal/hybrid") towards the left, pushing the evidence columns
(F,G,K,M) to the right?  On my screen I can't view the price and the
journal columns at the same time.  The evidence columns (and maybe the
reporter column) are footnotes, in a sense.

I'd do it myself but such a major change will disrupt anyone working
with the document so should be agreed collectively (or at least
announced on-list).

> What qualifies a journal to get onto this sheet?

I've taken a slightly more inclusive approach than PMR actually.

I've included more than just OAhybrid journals.

My position is that it should be a survey of all research publications
(e.g. journals, articles) that claim or self-label themselves as "open
access". Many as we have discovered are in fact NOT Open Access as per
the Budapest Declaration, despite this self-applied label.

Thus included on the spreadsheet are OA hybrid journals,publishers,
"open access" journals/publishers, and proper Open Access (Budapest
Declaration) journals/publishers.

Sometimes a publisher has multiple types of journals. So we try and
differentiate between those streams. I suggest we score only those
that are labelled "open access". Hence I should probably remove AAAS
(Science) as AFAIK I don't they claim to make any of their articles
"open access" - please correct me if you can find any though!

However, I concede there may be another interesting line of
investigation - that of journals that cleverly word their terms and
conditions so as NOT to make use of the phrase "open access", whilst
simultaneously making articles freely available and claiming that this
is in full-compliance with funding agencies such as Wellcome Trust,
NIH, NSF etc... Within the current scoring scheme of the spreadsheet
to include this might be tricky - another separate colour perhaps, for
cases such as these?

Has anyone looked into whether CC-NC is compatible with funders terms
and conditions?
I hope it is not; as we have seen in many of the discussion threads
here recently - the CC-NC license can and does harm research re-use
potential.

Regards,

Ross



PS Feel free to discuss further scoping issues, I'm just voicing my opinion...

Perhaps this is something that the EU could address for its agencies. Or maybe it takes the same line as the US.

Comment:

A search of PubMed for " Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural [pt]" on December 11, 2011 yields the following percentages of fulltext:

Within 60 days of publication:  12% (this figure varies, no clear gains since 2008)
Within 3 years of publication:  66% (this figure has steadily risen from 43% in 2008)

To my knowledge, there is no way of figuring out what percentage is open access as opposed to freely available, regardless of how one defines open access.

Full data available for download from my dataverse (thanks to Harvard), at:
http://dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/dgoa

See the latest full data edition, 3rd tab (PMC free).

This spreadsheet is currently licensed as CC-BY-NC-SA. I have meaning to consider an appropriate data license, but have lost track of open data licensing discussions. Should I be looking at Panton Principles or an Open Knowledge license? Advice appreciated.

While I fully support and advocate for funder open access policies, there are reasons to hesitate about funders insisting on particular licenses.

It should be the author, not the funder and not the publisher, deciding on the terms of the license. That should be the aims of the author's rights movement, and this is the approach that is the best fit with academic freedom - another concept that is in need of support at this point in time.

A limitation of the public funding argument is that in many cases public funding only covers some of the costs. For example, to become a grad student, one must first be a undergrad. There are still places where post-secondary education is fully subsidized, however partial or no subsidies seems to be more common. If a grad student is paying for their undergrad education (or perhaps still carrying debt), as well as paying tuition, while working on a research project, I would argue that it is the grad student who is funding the research. If grad students are to be told how to license their work on the basis that it is "publicly funding", I would advise grad students to say, okay where is the public funding?

If we are saying that the main purpose of this research is to advance commercialization opportunities for the corporate sector, then I would argue that it is the students who are subsidizing the corporate sector.

Does an analogous argument apply to graduates working in the private
sector?  If not, why not?  Their work products require their skills
which are similarly based on their education, which someone (usually
the graduate or a government) has paid for.  Are they entitled to a
share of the work products based on that subsidy?  Or is it assumed
that their salary pays for their skills?

I am a little confused by the terminology of the Creative Commons licenses
within this group discussion.

If you look at this particular PMC article and read the Acknowledgements
section it seems to imply a CC-BY license:

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144372/

and perhaps some assumptions are being made in this group discussion, where
they should not be.  This page explained PMC's organization of "open
access" quite well for me personally,

It's not at all like the US.  I think there's often a laissez-faire
approach based on some concept of encouraging private enterprise.

Also, the EU has a bad habit of inventing its own licences when asked
to address this in other fields.  At least, I think that's why we were
cursed with things like the degrades-to-GPL CeCILL-B licence and the
not-so-simple EU Datagrid Licence.

If anyone asks the EU to address this for its agencies, please be
careful how the request is worded!

(cc'd because it was crossposted to a list I don't belong to.)

Hope that informs,

Dear all,

 

The British Library is currently examining options for making subject
specific journal article metadata (e.g. Biotechnology) available for
projects in a basic RDF/XML representation (i.e. not linked data). The
metadata would be distributed under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal
Public Domain Dedication licence. A sample file covering the topic of
Palaeontology is now available for feedback at:
http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datasamples.html

 

Please contact us at metadata at bl.uk for further information

 

All the best

Dear all,

 

We've just published the British Library Terms RDF schema defined during
our Linked Open BNB project. The one significant change between this and
the draft schema is that we've had to change the namespace for this
vocabulary. Anybody wishing to use blt: classes and properties should
reference it as http://www.bl.uk/schemas/bibliographic/blterms#
<http://www.bl.uk/schemas/bibliographic/blterms>  

 

Please see http://www.bl.uk/schemas for further info on this schema and
http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html for further info on our
linked data project.

 

Feel free to contact us at metadata at bl.uk

That's great, thanks - hopefully others will respond with feedback but in
the meantime thank you for sending this through and keeping us informed.

I have just started working with the OKFN (Open Biblio project) and look
forward to liaising with you in future.

Corine,

FYI, I saw a few pure "Geology" field of study articles in the sample file
that were not concerning "Palaeontology" at all.

Some were in the SPECIAL PAPERS- GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA and others.

1.  Will this occur because of a processing problem with the journal
metadata received or manual mishaps ?  I am thinking that "Palaeontology"
is indeed one of the carried subjects specified in the SPECIAL PAPERS-
GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA.  But a user of this sample XML does not
really see this.  If so, then perhaps it might be best in the RDF/XML to
also carry a URI that can take the user to the journal metadata that will
list all the possible subjects that journal carries ?  Or is there another
method for this discovery ?

Hi Thad

 

The subject selection was based on the DDC (560 - Paleontology)
assigned at journal title level rather than at article level so, as you
say, "Palaeontology" is one of the carried subjects in this journal (the
other being 551 - Geology, hydrology, meteorology).  For this sample, we
are principally interested in feedback on the structure of the metadata
rather than the subject selection; if we were to offer selections in
this format in future, we would try to refine the subject selection
using some other mechanisms, such as keywords in the title/abstract,
other subject classes (LCC and local subject codes), although this would
still be imperfect since BL metadata for journal articles is not
currently classified or (subject) indexed at article title level.

 

Many thanks for your interest.

 

Heather

Heather,

Many thanks for the explanation.  One final question.

Who does the assigning of subjects at the journal title level ?  BL ?  Or
do you simply take the subjects already assigned to the journal by the
publishers ?

Awesome.  Could you expand on what is meant by the distinction between
basic RDF and linked data?

Does it have something to do with why a snippet like this:

<rda:placeOfPublication>
  <rdf:Description>
    <rdfs:label>xuu</rdfs:label>
    <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/countries"/>
    <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept"/>
  </rdf:Description>
</rda:placeOfPublication>

doesn't simply link to http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/countries/xuu ?  I
think a direct link would be more useful and could it could be
generated mechanically.  Ditto for
http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2/eng

Some other things I noticed:

- Having the ISSN as both a URN and in textual forms seems redundant

- There are author names which look malformed (perhaps as the result
of a bad parse?), such as:
  - , S. x.
  - s
  - , J.

- XML encoding of special characters appears broken, e.g. de Ricql? is
encoded as:

    <rdfs:label>de Ricql&amp;#xe8</rdfs:label>

  There seem to be two flavors of this problem.  Double escaping and
double escaping with the trailing semicolon missing.

- There are some improbable looking titles for articles which are
supposedly in French:

  CHARACTERIZATION OF CRUSTACEAN CENTRAL GLIA
  CORTICAL CONNECTIONS OF AREA V4 IN THE MACAQUE
  Paleogeographic-palinspastique maps of the Swiss Molasse Basin
(Early Oligocene-Middle Miocene)

- Palaeoworld and "PALAEOWORLD -NANJING THEN KIDLINGTON-" both have
the same ISSN and appear to be the same journal despite being
referenced separately.

- Some journal names end with a full stop/dot/period ('.') while most
do not.  A consistent convention would make the data easier to use.

Thanks for making the data available!

Tom

Open palaeontological star? I think not. I just rant and shout a bit
;) Some of the true Open palaeo stars are listed in here though:
http://prezi.com/d9yztcafx_ag/open-palaeontology/

anyway...

many thanks for the notification. I'll send some further emails off
list about how I might be able to use this resource.

Must say - palaeontology is a good choice of case study - most of the
literature sits outside of PubMed so it's far less well served IMO

best,

Ross

Hi Tom

Many thanks for your comments.

The purpose of releasing this initial data sample was to see how much interest there might be amongst researchers in having access to datasets in particular subject areas in a format in common use.  The metadata is derived from the British Library's "ETOC" database which provides subscription based access to 20,000 of the BL's most popular research journals.  The metadata is held in a proprietary, SGML, format.  The sample dataset, covering articles from journals classed as "Palaeontology", is our first attempt to make some of this data available under the same terms and conditions as our other "basic RDF/XML" metadata offerings (http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html#basicrdfxml). If there is sufficient interest, we may look to develop a linked data format similar to the BNB books dataset (http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html#lod).  To do this, however, would require more work on our part in terms of modelling which we are not in a position to do at this time.

With regard to the errors in data content, no attempt has been made to correct this. The content is exactly as offered via the ETOC subscription service; only the format, coverage (limited to certain subject sets), and terms and conditions under which it can be accessed, have changed.

Best wishes

Heather

Hello,

Does anyone know of an authority file of scholarly journal publishers that
is available as open data?  Ideally it would focus on journal publishers
and be comprehensive, but incomplete files or files with a broader focus
would also be useful.  I checked The Data Hub and did not find anything.
 OCLC did some work on
this<http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/publisherns/default.htm>a
couple of years ago, but it doesn't look like anything came of it yet.
 We're looking for such an authority file to use in the Knowledge for All
open index of scholarly journal articles, but I think it could also be
useful for other bibliographic data projects.

Thanks!
Amanda

You could try http://www.tictocs.ac.uk/
This is a JISC project - I am not sure of the openness of all the journal
metadata but I would hope the publisher data was noncontroversial.

I would?ve hoped that Suncat could help, however I just took look at their newsletter and whilst they?ve been making efforts to open up their data and also exploring making it available as linked data it seems that licensing issues are still a barrier.  But it might be worth taking a look.

http://www.suncat.ac.uk/news/suncat_newsletter9.pdf

Just as an aside at the moment at jisc we?re about to embark on an analysis of all of these sorts of ?data sets? that are funded by us and hosted by related jisc services to assess the openness of the data and the value of making it more so.

We're looking for such an authority file to use in the Knowledge for All open index of scholarly journal articles, but I think it could also be useful for other bibliographic data projects.

Thanks!
Amanda
