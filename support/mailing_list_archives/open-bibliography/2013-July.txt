Subject: [open-bibliography] DC-2013/iPRES-2013 conferences EARLY
	REGISTRATION extended to 15 July
Message-ID: <CAP884EwVq9_sA26Rx++rc=4tD0F_iF+McvZT47rfiEBQAkpmRA@mail.gmail.com>

*Apologies for cross-posting*

*=== iPRES-2013 / DC-2013 INVITATION TO LISBON ===*

iPRES-2013 and DC-2013 (Dublin Core) are co-locating on 2-6 September 2013
in Lisbon, Portugal at the Instituto Superior T?cnico. A unique common
registration provides full access to both the conference programs and
digital proceedings. Keynotes will be held in shared iPRES/Dublin Core
plenary sessions, and papers sessions specific of each conference will run
in parallel.  Tutorials, per-conference events, and workshops are
cross-listed for both conferences, and require registration.  Keynote
speaker Gildas Illien will address the common goals, values and points of
intersection of the preservation and metadata communities in "Darling, Can
We Talk" (Keynote Asbtract:
http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/index/pages/view/keynotes-2013#Illien
).

-- iPRES-2013, 10th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PRESERVATION OF DIGITAL
OBJECTS *** emphasizes the significance of preserving scientific and
cultural digital heritage across institutional and disciplinary boundaries.
 iPRES 2013  will further strengthen the link between digital preservation
research and practitioners in memory institutions and scientific data
centers.
  * iPRES Conference website: http://ipres2013.ist.utl.pt/index.html
  * iPRES Preliminary Program: http://ipres2013.ist.utl.pt/prg_overview.html

-- DC-2013, LINKING TO THE FUTURE *** explores questions regarding the
persistence, maintenance, and preservation of metadata and descriptive
vocabularies. The need for stable representations and descriptions spans
all sectors including cultural heritage and scientific data, eGovernment,
finance and commerce. Thus, the maintenance and management of metadata is
essential to address the long term availability of information of legal,
cultural and economic value.

  * Dublin Core Program:
http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/IntConf/index/pages/view/program-2013

iPRES/DC-2013 provides a unique opportunity for interlinking fundamental to
cutting edge preservation and metadata knowledge.
