Apologies for cross-posting but I just sent this to the Humanities Working
Group list and it may of interest to many of you considering the success of
Bibliohack earlier this year, I hope to see some faces from there at this
event!

Dear All,

As part of the DM2E <http://dm2e.eu> project, the Open Knowledge Foundation
in collaboration with Kings College London will be running a Digital
Humanities Hackday between 21st-22nd November in central London

A group from the OKFN will be in force working specifically on textual
annotation and extensions to the open source
TEXTUS<http://textusproject.org/>platform for annotating and collating
digitised public domain texts.

*When*: 21st-22nd November 2012
*Where*: Guys Campus, Hodgkin Building, London, SE1 1UL
*Sign up via the Google
Form<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFp1eExmUVMtWG1YUkNZSnFFd05EWlE6MQ>
*
*Add datasets to be used at the
hack<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al6mO9_3Hr2PdFJ2aEFzNTZZMVVDbkJZWXB1YTRkOWc#gid=0>
*

---
*
*
The aim of the hack day is not to produce complete applications but to
experiment with methods and technologies to investigate these data sets so
that at the end we can have an understanding of the types of novel
techniques that are emerging.
We are providing a few open humanities data sets but we welcome any
addition. We are currently collecting data sets
here<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Al6mO9_3Hr2PdFJ2aEFzNTZZMVVDbkJZWXB1YTRkOWc#gid=0>
.

Possible themes include but are not limited to

*-          Research in textual annotation has been a particular strength
of Digital Humanities. Where are the next frontiers? How can we bring
together insights from other fields and Digital Humanities?*
*-          How do we provide linking and sharing Humanities data that
makes sense of its complex structure, with many internal relationships both
structural and semantic. In particular, distributed Humanities research
data often includes digital material combining objects in multiple media,
and in addition there is diversity of standards for describing the data.*
*-          Visualisation. How do we develop reasonable visualisations that
are practical and help build on overall intuition for the underlying
Humanities data set*
*-          How can we advance the novel Humanities technique of Network
Analysis to describe complex relationships of 'things' in social-historical
systems: people, places, etc.*

With this hack day we seek to from groups of computing and humanities
researchers that will work together to come up with small-scale prototypes
that showcase new and novel ways of working with Humanities data.

As numbers are limited for this hack, please register
here<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFp1eExmUVMtWG1YUkNZSnFFd05EWlE6MQ>
.

The event will lead on from the AHRC Digital Transformations Moot at the
Mermaid Conference Centre in London on Monday 19 November 2012 at which the
Open Knowledge Foundation will present some of its work in the humanities.
 Registration for this event is free and those joining the Humanities
Hackfest might also enjoy attending the Moot. Further details can be found

Message-ID: <CAP884ExU2yj5xR_gKudq7tEq5gWq7Cb64Wf=w6Ehmy1QKH-aQA@mail.gmail.com>

Webinar: Embedding Linked Data Invisibly into Web Pages: Strategies and
Workflows for Publishing with RDFa
Date: October 24, 2012
Time: 1:00 ? 2:30 p.m. (Eastern time)
Event webpage:
http://www.niso.org/news/events/2012/dcmi/publishing_with_RDFa/
-------------------

ABOUT THE WEBINAR

As described in the April NISO/DCMI webinar by Dan Brickley, schema.org is
a search-engine initiative aimed at helping webmasters use structured data
markup to improve the discovery and display of search results. Drupal 7
makes it easy to markup HTML pages with schema.org terms, allowing users to
quickly build websites with structured data that can be understood by
Google and displayed as Rich Snippets.

Improved search results are only part of the story, however. Data-bearing
documents become machine-processable once you find them. The subject
matter, important facts, calendar events, authorship, licensing, and
whatever else
you might like to share become there for the taking. Sales reports, RSS
feeds, industry analysis, maps, diagrams and process artifacts can now
connect back to other data sets to provide linkage to context and related
content. The key to this is the adoption standards for both the data model
(RDF) and the means of weaving it into documents (RDFa). Drupal 7 has
become the leading content platform to adopt these standards.

This webinar will describe how RDFa and Drupal 7 can improve how
organizations publish information and data on the Web for both internal and
external consumption. It will discuss what is required to use these
features and how they impact publication workflow. The talk will focus on
high-level and accessible demonstrations of what is possible. Technical
people should learn how to proceed while non-technical people will learn
what is possible.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Extract Translations from WorldCat?
Message-ID: <9F7FA2E0294A934CA0CD9E97BD580F84129051FF@CCS-EXCHANGE1.brynmill.swan.ac.uk>

Hello, dear Open Bibliography group,

 

[I sent the following to the ScraperWiki list yesterday and David Jones
has suggested I try you - saying: "I think some people there have done
some WorldCat hacking". But come to think of it, there might be better
sources than WorldCat for the data I'm interested in?]

 

Here's a major challenge - possibly new (?): scrape out of WorldCat all
the items which are translations, and link them with all the items which
are translated. 

 

Doing this would (1) help anyone find any translations of a work or find
the original of any translation (= a tool which performs as an interface
to WorldCat data) and (2) build a dynamic dataset representing global
cultural flows (= a stats tool).

 

Data about WorldCat items includes OCLC number, title, date, publisher,
language, edition/format, personal names under 'author' (sometimes also
'responsibility'), sometimes 'other titles', 'notes' etc. - the fields
vary depending on the library catalogue or other source they came from.

 

In the case of translations, the fact that a work is a translation is
often only shown in the title field:  '... translated from ... by ...'
can appear.  So we might have to start by collating all items with such
phrases (in all languages) in the title field, and extracting names.
Translator names will be key links.

 

An 'other title', esp if it is in a different language (but that won't
be marked), is probably an original title (but might be the title of a
translation...).  

 

WorldCat entries are cross-referenced to ''all editions and formats' -
and that includes multiple copies, differing editions, and translations,
but translations are only linked IF they have the same title as the
original (or partly the same). So the English translation of Kristeva's
"Hannah Arendt" biography is linked to the Japanese and Polish
translations, but not to the French original. 

 

Index Translationum, started in 1932 by the League of Nations, now run
by UNESCO, keeps a record of all the world's literary translations. Its
records could be used to cross-check links, perhaps?

 

Just an idea..!

 

Tom

Hi Tom,
The xISBN API already returns multiple language variations of an item (and editions) e.g.
http://xisbn.worldcat.org/webservices/xid/isbn/0596002815?method=getEditions&fl=*&format=json (also:
http://www.oclc.org/developer/documentation/xisbn/response-details)

This would cover *recent* items (e.g. items with an ISBN), but not older texts - and I'm not sure how you tell which language is the original?

Does that help at all with what you're trying to do?
Cheers,
John

Thanks John. That's definitely a start! 

 

How are the various ISBNS and/or OCLCs associated? Is that done
manually? (I notice that the OCLC 749427863, for one of the Polish
editions, is not in any of the lists of OCLCs e.g. at 177669176 - so it
must be an ISBN association?)

 

There is an 'Original Language' field - but only for the translations -
and that's not the same as a link or pointer to an original-language
edition.

 

Tricky!

Cheers

Tom

Here's the OCLC documentation on their xISBN algorithm:

http://www.worldcat.org/affiliate/webservices/xisbn/app.jsp

"Original" editions (either original language or original print or 
original edition) are not identified in library cataloging. This is a 
huge gap, but it seems to be a near-universal one.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Reminder: Register for SWIB12 (Semantic Web in
 Libraries, Cologne, 26 - 28 Nov)
Message-ID: <508E703D020000140004B40B@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

This is a reminder for everybody interested to register for SWIB12 (Semantic Web in Libraries) Conference in Cologne, 26 - 28 November 2012.

Please register before November 19th at http://swib.org/swib12. For all people registering late: Please bring a proof of payment to the conference.


Towards an international LOD library ecosystem

To an ever increasing extent Linked Open Data (LOD) is developing into a mainstream topic, with more and more organizations announcing LOD projects and services. Furthermore, and especially during the last two years, Linked Open Data has received a lot more attention from the library world. Examples ranging from the Library of Congress' initiative "A Bibliographic Framework for the Digital Age", the Conference of European National Librarians and their vote to support the open licensing of their data, groups like LODLAM, IFLA'S Semantic Web Special Interest Group, to the point of library system vendors and providers discussing and experimenting with Linked Data technology - all these clearly reflect that LOD has gained a lot of momentum in library land.

The question today is about how to ensure that LOD won't be a temporary hype but that it will gain ground in the scenery of future infrastructures. SWIB12 will focus on the adaption of Semantic Web approaches in applications for libraries and science. In the last years major efforts have been put into generating LOD datasets from legacy systems and into promoting the LOD approach towards a global and open information space. Upcoming challenges will involve the strategic and technical alignment of catalogues and legacy systems in libraries and the authoring environments for scholarly communication - both in a data and service infrastructure based on the principles of the Semantic Web.

Subject: [okfn-discuss] Request: Volunteers to curate open/public data
sources to support Hurricane Sandy recovery
To: Open Knowledge Foundation discussion list <okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org>


Hello all,

This weekend, several groups of volunteers around the world will gather to
undertake projects to support the hurricane recovery efforts[0]. The OKFN
community has a distinct ability to help here, in particular it has lots of
knowledge about datahub.io.

There are bound to be hundreds of disparate spreadsheets, databases and
other information sources spring up over the next few days. It would be
excellent if they could be indexed as appropriately tagged. That will
foster discovery and reuse greatly.

Would anyone be interested in helping out with this?
