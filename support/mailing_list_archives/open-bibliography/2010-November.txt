Subject: [open-bibliography] Discussing the openbiblio principles
Message-ID: <AANLkTikXaCqB-dcXt=aRrXssnnAkM2eok5fNPBBhJ6mk@mail.gmail.com>

On October 15th we published a draft for "Principles on Open
Bibliographic Data"[1] on openbiblio.net, asking for comments. I am
myself not yet satisfied with the principles and will point out some
basic problems which - in my opinion - have to be resolved before
publishing the principles in a first "stable" version. But first, I
will lay out the current structure and content of the principles.

== The principle's structure ==

The principles are divided into four parts with part three being quite
short. These are the parts:

Part 1: Some kind of preamble.

Part 2: A definition of bibliographic data as used in the principles.
In short it says: A bibliographic record is an aggregation of
statements about a bibliographic resource which sufficiently
identifies (and optionally addresses) a bibliographic resource. A
bibliographic resource can be an article, a monographs, a series etc.
Also, an enumeration of most bibliographic data is attempted.

Part 3: A statement that neither a bibliographic record nor any of its
previously defined parts meet the threshold of originality[2] and are
thus automatically in the public domain. It is further noticed that
there might only be rights (e.g. the European sui generis database
right[3] on collections of bibliographic data.

Part 4: A set of five principles for dealing with bibliographic data
which build on each other:
 1. The first principle makes clear that in publishing bibliographic
data - whether single records or collections - you best make a license
statement about which usage of the data you want to allow.
 2. The second principle makes clear that software licenses or content
licenses like most Creative Commons licenses aren't appropriate for
data and thus shouldn't be used.
 3. The third principle asks for using _open_ licenses and points out
that particularly non commercial licenses aren't open.
 4. The fourth principle asks to choose a _specific_ open license for
bibliographic data: a public domain license like CC0 or PDDL.
 5. The fifth and last principle now lists parts of bibliographic data
which haven't been mentioned in the second (definition) part because
they might fall under copyright: abstracts, keywords, reviews.
Creators of bibliographic data are asked to also license this -
potentially copyrighted - bibliographic data with an open license or
dedicate it to the public domain.

== Proposals for improvement ==

Here are my observations and proposals for improvement. The most
fundamental and important problem is outlined in the beginning (1.).

 1. I was quite confused by Peter's post[4] on the principles. Peter writes:

"Note that I am NOT talking about COLLECTIONS of bibliographic records
(which may be copyrightable in some jurisdictions) but individual
records which are uncopyrightable."

Though it might be good for didactical reasons to start with the
public domain status of single bibliographic records I think we SHOULD
explicitely and first and foremost talk about COLLECTIONS of data. At
least, I am talking about collections of bibliographic records and the
principles draft - like the Panton Principles[5] - explicitely refers
to collections in at least two places.

I think that not much would be won if publishers put a public domain
mark[6] or something similar on single bibliographic records. Even now
nobody objects if you take a bibliographic record e.g. for reference
management with Zotero, many websites even support it through
microformats etc. Thus, single bibliographic records are already
treated as part of the public domain. But if you crawl a website and
take a substantial part of all bibliographic records you might get
into legal problems - and the  principles wouldn't try to change this
if they only adressed single bibliographic records. The underlying
legal fact is that you can have copyright or database right on a
collection of data whose parts themselves are explicitely in the
public domain or - in  other words: If all parts of a collection are
for themselves in the public domain it doesn't necessarily follow that
you are legally allowed to take, reuse and pass on the whole
collection or substantial parts of it.

2. As the first point seems to me the most pressing problem we should
try to solve I also have some other observations. A related basic
structural problem with the principle's _definition_ of bibliographic
data in part two is that it doesn't cover some parts of bibliographic
data for legal reasons: Abstracts, keywords and reviews aren't
contained in the definition because they might be copyrightable. I
think this should be fixed a definition of bibliographic data should
not leave out parts of bibliographic data because of their legal
status. I propose the distinction between potentially copyrightable
and non-copyrightable bibliographic data to be made in the definition
part (part 2) and thus to include possibly copyrighted parts of
bibliographic data in this definition.

3. A problem with the definition of bibliographic resources might be -
although I think it is no problem to be vague here - that it leaves
unclear whether DVDs, computer games, paintings, records, sculptures
etc. are covered.

4. Another problem I have with the draft principles from a library
perspective: authority files and authority records are included but in
the background although they may form the most important and reusable
parts of library data. (I think this is at least the case for name
authority data.)

5. A small problem we can fix the easiest: The principles sometimes
talk about "bibliographic metadata" and sometimes about "bibliographic
data". This should be harmonized and at one point - if "bibliographic
metadata" is chosen  - made clear that metadata legally falls under
the concept of data. Laura James adressed this problem in a comment on
openbiblio.net[7].

I would be very happy to get these questions answered and to resolve
the discrepancies so that we can eventually publish a sensible and
consistent principle text.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Sharing bibliographic user data
Message-ID: <AANLkTikVueFwO-P6fsSLhsQb7rWzMobaX-jkN0zhwKNB@mail.gmail.com>

Excuse me if this surpasses the purposes of this list, but I wanted to
start a conversation about how to accomplish the sharing of user data
related to bibliographic data, and keep it open.

Basically, many institutions and sites are gathering user data
relative to books?tags, reviews, lists, etc. How can that data be
shared?

Let's say, for example, that two libraries were collecting tags or
reviews and wanted to share that data in an open way. How would they
do it? What should the balance be between openness, privacy, and
keeping users in control of their data? Is there an open license that
requires you to refresh data, so a user can release their review but
expect to be able to update it? Should institutions sharing tags
include primary keys relative to users, or just submit total tag
counts, etc.?

Any thoughts?

Tim

This definitely does not surpass the remit of the list (at least IMO!)
and I think this is a *really* important topic. The 'user' data you
mention is part of the crucial 'value-added' information that enhances
the original dataset and makes being 'open' attractive.

I think there are distinct issues here:

1. What data should people make public at all (or, conversely, what
data should people *not* make public because of e.g. privacy)

2. If data is made public should it be openly licensed?

My answer for (2) would be (almost always): 'Yes'

The answer for (1) must obviously be more nuanced.

In general, my suggestion would be that we can start with aggregate
data (e.g. tags and tag counts per book, usage (views/borrowing etc)
per book), where the resulting anonymization should mitigate any
privacy concerns.

Of course, one has to be cautious about what exactly aggregate data
involves: simple tag or usage counts per work should present no
problems but if you start doing intersections e.g. the number of
people who took out book X and book Y and book Z as this may allow for
indirect identification.

An obvious other point to make here is that it would be good idea if
services started asking users (when they sign up) if they are happy
for, say, all there tags and (separately) all their usage data to be
shared (on a per-user basis ). There may be many users who are quite
happy to share their data in this way.

Regards,

Rufus

Thanks for the reply. I broadly agree. Let me put part of my question
in concrete terms.

1. Most users on LibraryThing make their tags and reviews public.
2. LibraryThing exposes their tags on library catalogs (our
LibraryThing for Libraries product). Users don't object to this. (If
they do, they can opt out on the reviews side.)
3. BUT users know that the data is coming from LibraryThing. If they
change their review, it will soon change on the libraries too. If they
removed it, it would get removed.
4. I believe that if LibraryThing merely released the data, with no
obligation to refresh it, people would be VERY upset.

See? The problem isn't openness. It's respect for the user. Users are
happy with their data going other places, but they still think of it
as theirs, and want to make sure they can change or remove it.

How is that solved, in an open context?

Tim

Thanks Tim, This is definitely in scope. We are particularly keen that
people start using the Bibliography that is coming out of the Open
Bibliography project

I don't believe it can be solved by licences - licences that say you must do
this if you want to use it tend to crash. There is no doubt that Open
Knowledge can in principle rebound to the disadvantage of the releaser - if
someone takes my work and edits it without indication (which many licences
permit) then many people will assume I said something I didn't. There are
many cases where changing a document is dangerous to human life.

A technical approach which the software community uses is checksums (MD5,
etcd.) - that can be used to assert that the contents of the document are
unaltered. But most people don't have the technology to operate this .

In many communities misuse of documents is highly discouraged and may incur
penalties - in others nobody cares. I think it's valuable to create norms
for their usage and to promote these. We are seeing this general type of
problem everywhere - if information is accessible who has the moral right to
do something with it. It'll take at least 10 years of social experiments to
resolve some of these.

Generally the more we can anticipate problems and inform people, the fewer
surprises.

I think what you are asking about is not sharing data, but creating a
set of the data and sharing that as a separate resource (like a zip file
of csv or rdf)

For example, given an API in which usage data can be retrieved in real
time, many will just 'copy-by-reference' - pulling in the data on demand
and so reflect the data as it is at any given moment.

If you release a snapshot of data (to help lower API load) then you can
remind the reusers to respect that the data has a best-before-date,
especially for things like labels, lists and tags and to remain as in
sync as practical.

If your users will be upset with the perceived lack of control
downstream, then perhaps you cannot freely share the data? Perhaps a
survey or a mailshot to all your users illustrating what you would like
to do may help find out exactly how they may react?

===========
Description
===========

During the past few years, great and continually increasing scientific interest has been paid towards the efficient dissemination and management of the world's cultural assets on the Web. As more and more cultural heritage institutions tend to exploit World Wide Web's technologies in order to render their collections globally available, integrated access to this vast amount of content has become an imperative need. Traditionally, the main requisite for integrating diverse resources has been syntactic interoperability. However, in the more knowledge-intensive world of the Semantic Web a number of powerful techniques are offering the promise of knowledge-based management and retrieval instead of mere syntactic data exchange. In particular, techniques for obtaining semantic interoperability and reasoning over metadata and ontologies have been proven powerful tools towards this direction.

In the cultural heritage field, significant efforts have been initiated for achieving semantic-aware data integration, but many issues are still under discussion and problems remain unsolved. Hundreds of existing digital libraries and repository systems, responsible for gathering and disseminating digital objects originating from cultural assets, still lack common standards and best practices for properly ingesting and publishing knowledge. The community is looking for powerful semantic search and navigation mechanisms able to efficiently retrieve and interlink distributed, heterogeneous knowledge about cultural heritage. In addition, it is not clear what might be the most suitable evaluation techniques for analyzing the suggested methods and tools.


======
Topics
======

This special issue solicits contributions to the open problems of publishing cultural content on the Semantic Web, such as innovative techniques, tools,
case studies, comparisons, and theoretical advances. The papers should consider and present contributions towards representing semantic aspects of
cultural heritage information in the web environment, i.e. aspects of modeling, creating, aggregating, managing, publishing, and using content on
the Semantic Web in the cultural heritage field.


In particular, topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

   - Semantic-enabled search and recommending
   - Reasoning over cultural heritage information
   - Semantic content creation and annotation
   - Semantic integration of heterogeneous and contradicting information
   - Ontologies and vocabularies for cultural heritage
   - Linked heritage data and its applications
   - Semantic aging and ontology evolution
   - Evaluation of semantic techniques and systems
   - Web 2.0, collaborative systems, tagging, and user feedback
   - Semantic and mental maps of interlinked cultural content
   - Visualization techniques and paradigms
   - Success reports of in-use applications and projects


===========
Submissions
===========

High-quality papers containing original research results on the above and related topics are solicited. Extended versions of papers previously
published in conferences and workshops are also welcome, provided that they are substantially expanded and improved. Authors should submit a manuscript
through the Semantic Web Journal on-line system, following the guidelines available at: http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors. Manuscripts
should have a length of 15-25 pages in IOS Press format. All submissions will undergo an open review process, according to the standards of the
Semantic Web Journal.

Ironic to see this list used to promote a subscription journal which is not
freely available on the web. Cant we promote open access journals for Sematic Web research?

> During the past few years, great and continually increasing scientific interest has been paid towards the efficient dissemination and management of the world's cultural assets on the Web. As more and more cultural heritage institutions tend to exploit World Wide Web's technologies in order to render their collections globally available, integrated access to this vast amount of content has become an imperative need. Traditionally, the main requisite for integrating diverse resources has been syntactic interoperability. However, in the more knowledge-intensive world of the Semantic Web a number of powerful techniques are offering the promise of knowledge-based management and retrieval instead of mere syntactic data exchange. In particular, techniques for obtaining semantic interoperability and reasoning over metadata and ontologies have been proven powerful tools towards this direction.

> In the cultural heritage field, significant efforts have been initiated for achieving semantic-aware data integration, but many issues are still under discussion and problems remain unsolved. Hundreds of existing digital libraries and repository systems, responsible for gathering and disseminating digital objects originating from cultural assets, still lack common standards and best practices for properly ingesting and publishing knowledge. The community is looking for powerful semantic search and navigation mechanisms able to efficiently retrieve and interlink distributed, heterogeneous knowledge about cultural heritage. In addition, it is not clear what might be the most suitable evaluation techniques for analyzing the suggested methods and tools.

While the journal isn't open access, it uses an open (public) review process. So publications are available online in the "in-review" state.

If you have a list of open access journals for Semantic Web, please share it!

I'm not familiar with enough with this space of journals to provide suggestions.

It does appear that IOS Press may be a small enough publisher that they
might be persuaded to publish their metadata with an open license.   I doubt that
a single journal could do this alone. The rights are owned by the publisher,
so the journal has to make the case to the publisher, and the publisher will want a common
policy for all its journals. Editors typically see little value in pushing for this sort of thing.  
If you go via the editor you have to train the editor how to make the case to the publisher. It should be more 
reward for less work to go to the publishers directly, best in collaboration with one or more editors.

It would be worthwhile for this group to formulate the business case of why it is in the interest of a small 
or even medium sized publisher to make their metadata open, and to formulate exactly what we are asking of them. 
There are many shades of gray for the potentially copyrightable fields of biblio metadata.
Need something simple for publishers and users alike to understand, like checkboxes for each field similar to 
components of a CC license. I dont think it is useful to spend a lot of time on abstract principles
unless we can persuade actual publishers to adopt open metadata licenses. We need to find
suitable publishers and start working with them. There will be a continuing see-saw between what 
idealists in this group might like to see and what publishers are willing to concede, much like the
balance over self-archiving rights.
If serious about pushing towards a more open balance, I suggest OKFN should team up with 
Sherpa-Romeo http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/ to add some fields to their database for metadata licensing.

  It would also be worthwile to build actual functing systems and/or
  support those in the group who are already building value-added 
  systems. Once we have interoperating value-added systems around we
  have something concrete to ask data holders to contribute to.

http://obd.jisc.ac.uk

I hope the guide (which I co-authored with David Kay of Sero
http://www.sero.co.uk/ and Paul Miller of Cloud of Data
http://cloudofdata.com/) is useful, but it is also meant to be a 'live'
resource, so please feel free to share experience or add comments to the

Hello,

I am very happy that LibraryThing is thinking about opening up some
data. This discussion drove me to finally contact the people behind
BibSonomy[1] whether they would open up the BibSonomy data. In
genreal, they are interested but by their response some more questions
were raised concerning opening up user-generated data.

BibSonomy is a social bookmark and publication sharing system. Until
now BibSonomy offers an API[2] to reuse the data in library catalogs
etc. and they provide full dumps[3] for download by researchers. To
get these dumps you have to sign a license agreement[4]. As said, they
are open to releasing data under an open license but have some legal
concerns:

-  It's not they who collect the data but the users so the question
is: Is it that every user must agree to opening the aggregated data?
- Or can the service providers themselves open up data without asking the users?
- If it's ok for the service providers to open up the data: Which data
are they allowed to release under an open license? All data that is
publicly available anyway? Or should user-specific data be deleted to
some extend? E.g., is it OK to leave user names in place or should
they be anonymized? BibSonomy also has real names and even some
CVs[5]? Could they make these open without asking?

To get open data from social reference management services like
BibSonomy, book lovers sites like LibraryThing or user-generated data
from library catalogs we should provide some answers to these
questions...

As we know from experience with contracts (even implied ones) you have  
to make the right agreements at the beginning -- it is very  hard to  
change things afterward. I think we should be encouraging people to  
think about ownership before they take in data.

It doesn't seem to be too hard for BibSonomy to change the "contract",
i.e. the privacy protection. In the Terms of Use[1] it reads:

"2. The Terms of Use and the Privacy Statement may be changed without
notice. It is the user's responsibility to check the Terms of Use and
the Privacy Statement periodically."

And they have the pseudonymized data anyway because they give it to
other researchers:

"The entries are being used for research purposes in fields like spam
detection, recommender functions and are part of the data set, which
BibSonomy makes available in pseudonymous form for other research
facilities."

Because BibSonomy is a research project they also store other data
like IP addresses. But regarding open bibliographic data mainly the
publicly posted entries (BibTex-records(/URLs) + tags) would be
interesting. I don't think it would be legally hard to make this data
available to non-"researchers" for doing useful stuff with it.

Something that's been an ongoing issue for us in expressing 
bibliographic data in RDF, often we have fragments of text which contain 
markup mixed with ones that don't. HTML & LaTeX fragments being the most 
common.

http://purl.org/xtypes/

defines new datatypes to express this, eg.

<dc:description rdf:datatype='http://purl.org/Fragment-HTML'>Hello 
&lt;b&gt;World&lt;/b&gt;</dc:description>
<dc:description rdf:datatype='http://purl.org/Fragment-PlainText'>Hello 
World</dc:description>

PlainText explicitly indicates an absence of markup, other than 
CF,LF,Tab and others which are part of the character set.

I've been waiting years for a solution to this one, so I've given up and 
done it myself.

This is not mean unkindly but the easy thing to do is to create new
semantics. The harder thing is to get it adopted. Maybe the OKF is the right

You can refer to subtypes and versions in a structured way, eg. 
http://purl.org/xtypes/Fragment-MediawikiMarkup-1.0

But I would suggest that you know the exact dialect used withing your 
system, and it still *conforms* to the broader dialect so don't over 
think it.

Knowing if a field contains wiki markup, html, etc. will make it much 
easier to merge (bibliographic) data from multiple sources.

RST can be added to xtypes if that helps.

Excellent. I look forward to this. 
What I would like is to be able to easily filter out a dump of books by broad subject
domain, e.g. mathematics or statistics, and then be able to do some serious processing of those 
locally. This should be easier to provide than a full API, right? Who to contact to lobby for
priority for such use cases?

Great thanks to all those who contributed to this effort.

the data is now cleaned and loaded into a triplestore. just need to do
a dump of the cleaned data and tweak a few front-end things and it
will be available. i'll also give a few sample queries that will help
answer some of these questions. i'd actually say browsing by subject
heading - lcsh - might be nice and not too hard.

jim, i would imagine the process you are referring to to work
something like this - construct a query for the subset of the data
that you want, refine it, etc. once you have the identifiers for the
records you are interested in, you just fetch each one and add it to
your local store - identifiers are http uris of course.

will try t get this done today, but am at a conference and may have
limited screen time

cheers,

Thanks Will,

One great idea for a use-case has surfaced today (anonymous, but I'll give
credit if I get permission) - to add the author's death-date to
bibliography. This has immediate and widespread practicality in the OKF with
the release of the copyright calculator. It should be possible to mashup
chunks of the bibliography with DBPedia and I would expect this could
resolve many authors (with, of course the problem of disambiguation).
However known lists of authors with death dates might also help with the
disambiguation.

But maybe you have all thought of this already.

Ben, 

Your blog entry makes interesting reading. 

With reference to the occurrences of rdf:description instead of
rdf:Description, these have now been corrected and an updated version
(0.3.1) of the data is now available directly from the British Library.

Your post mentions RDF errors. Beyond the one noted above, is there
anything else? Obviously, we rely on user feedback to improve our
output; so, if there is anything else, please let us know.

Regards

Corine

I've been working on something like this with Cambridge library data 
(non-linked) and the OKN CC API. I'm looking at providing information on 
copyright status for a library catalogue for digitisation services, see the 
Public Domain list archive for more details. Its useful information anyway.

The mashup would be much more effective if we could agument patchy library 
death date information with another source.

one that stands out, while not an error in rdf syntax is the treatment
of isbns. they appear as dc:identifier, which is fine, though
bibo:isbn might be better, but they are expressed as
URN:ISBN:0123456789 - as a string literal rather than a
resource. additionally it is uncommon th uppercase the prefix there,
and case does matter.

also, none of the records have uris. they are all identified with
blank nodes. so one of the first things we did was to mint uris for
them - htttp://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/... (sorry, on the train
right now, typing into my mobile so i can't get a real example, but if
you run the default sparql query you should find something). in an
ideal world each record in the british national bibliography will have
an identifier like http://bnb.bl.uk/GB123ABC that will dereference,
etc. - note for this dataset we've used the bnb id - which itself
wants a special predicate rather than just dc:identifier, or maybe a
datatype for use with skos:notation - as the primary identifier, since
that seemed appropriate...
 
last note, http://bnb.bibliographica.org/ is not yet for general
consumption, still need to hook together some bits of the user
interface for searching etc. over the next couple of days, so if you
do poke around, please consider it a preview for an interested
community rather than a finished product.

Me too. Many thanks for this initiative!
I have the same problem with BibJSON http://www.bibkn.org/bibjson/index.html
and would be glad to coordinate on this. In JSON I've never got much better than
tagging keys with a format indicator e.g.  "title_html",  "title_tex", ...
This is not very JSONish, but it is at least easily encoded in BibTeX which is an advantage.
My concern with an RDF implementation is that it may quickly get very heavy. Note that with any
format indication, there are nuances of meaning which may need to be specificied. e.g. it is useful
to know for display purposes if html is limited to just a few tags, and there are different versions of tex, latex, ...
Having a pointer to a rigorous format description that will allow consumers of the data to process it with
out too much burden of checking format variations would be very useful.

I deliberately hosted it via purl.org so that if needed it can be taken 
on by a group to develop. I'm aware of all the potential niggles about 
versions but IMO this is over engineering. I want a system which can 
tell me if something is plain text (not marked up at all), or some 
flavor of HTML.

Beware the siren call of The Modeller.
http://blogs.ecs.soton.ac.uk/webteam/files/2010/10/173285998-246x300.png

In xtypes you can specify something as a subclass if you really must, eg.
http://purl.org/xtypes/Fragment-LaTeX-2.1.23.ourSpecialVariation

But I think trying to formalise URIs for not only every version of these 
fragments, but every controlled subset... That way lies madness.

William, many thanks for your feedback. 

Re: isbns.
They appear in dcterms:identifier [http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier] and the range of that property is rdfs:literal [1], which is why we have recorded them as a string literal.

The latest version of the data available from us (version 0.3.1) also includes isbns and issns in bibo:isbn and bibo:issn. These are sub-properties of bibo:identifier, which has the range of rdfs:literal [2], which is why we again have recorded these as string literals.

My understanding is that if we wanted to treat isbns and issns as resources, then we would have to use dc:identifier http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier, which had no range defined or another property from another RDF vocabulary with the appropriate range.

I will lowercase the urn:isbn, urn:issn in our next release, thanks.

[1] http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-identifier
[2] http://bibotools.googlecode.com/svn/bibo-ontology/trunk/doc/index.html
 
We are aware that blank nodes are an issue but we are not in a position to mint our own URIs yet. We are investigating how best to do this.

Thanks again

Best, Corine

All,

One comment from DCMI on the range of dcterms:identifier.

The range of that property is rdfs:Literal, on purpose.

The reason is that an identifier is by definition a string of characters; it is not the resource it identifies. Of course, if the identifier is a URI, you can resolve that URI to get to the resource it identifies but it is not what the identifier "is".

<somenamespace:identifier rdf:resource="urn:isbn:0123456789" /> would say that the identifier IS the resource identified by the ISBN which is not what you want.

Corine, quite right. So what we have done is used bibo:isbn but we
have also converted the object to a resource which is wrong for the
same reason (bibo:isbn subPropertyOf dct:identifier) as you point
out. 

] The latest version of the data available from us (version 0.3.1)

] string literals.

Which is as it should be. In this case the values should not be
prefixed with urn:isbn, correct?

Is there a list of changes from the version that we have to 0.3.1?
The reason I ask is that it might be easier (quicker) for us to
basically patch the data in the store than to reload it from scratch
and re-index it again.

] My understanding is that if we wanted to treat isbns and issns as
] resources, then we would have to use dc:identifier
] http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/identifier, which had no range

] appropriate range.

Right. But using bibo:isbn is better since it properly disambiguates.

] We are aware that blank nodes are an issue but we are not in a
] position to mint our own URIs yet. We are investigating how best
] to do this.

So far experiences basically just loading the data into a Virtuoso
store (after minting URIs ourselves) and running some very thin
front-end software to make individual resources dereferencable seems
to be working well at scale. The loading process (well the indexing
of appropriate predicates for full-text search) was very slow, took
several days. But once it was done, performance is good even on modest
hardware (Amazon 64-bit instance, 8Gb of RAM). We would be more than
happy to help you duplicate the setup if that would be helpful.

Minting URIs is crucial though, because it is the only way to refer to
any of your data. Much as I think it would be cool to have
http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/xyz as the standard way to refer
to the BL catalogue, it really would be better if you were to do it
(and avoid a small forest of owl:sameAs in the future as the data
begins to get used).

William,

I am not sure what you mean by "confusing in that it was a literal that
was constructed like a URI".

In the sample I see:

    <dcterms:identifier>GBA164362</dcterms:identifier>

and

    <dcterms:identifier>URN:ISBN:1850877019</dcterms:identifier>

Both are correct usage of dcterms:identifier (apart from the uppercase
as you pointed out). In both cases the identifier is the (literal)
string of characters. The second identifier is not just "constructed
like a URI", it is a URI! 

Yes, it may be confusing that you can use the URI in two ways: either as
the (literal) string itself like here in dcterms:identifier, or as a
pointer to a resource which you would do if you used it in
dcterms:relation, for example.

Both

    <dcterms:identifier>someURI</dcterms:identifier>

and

    <dcterms:relation rdf:resource="someURI" />

are correct -- the URI just plays different roles.


Makx.

practices.

Both are correct in that they conform to the range of
dcterms:identifier. The problem of the first is that it isn't obvious
what kind of identifier it is -- as it turns out it is the British
National Bibliography identifier (I think).

The second is not a URI, it's a literal. It won't be indexed in stores
as a URI, the sparql isURI and isLITERAL tests will treat it as a
literal, etc.

The reason to have urn:isbn: is so that it is at least possible to tell
what kind of a number that is, probably better to use a dedicated
predicate like bibo:isbn in which you don't need to fudge it with a
urn:isbn: prefix.

Correct in terms of "are valid RDF" and "conform to the defined
semantics" but apart from some obscure cases involving reification, I
think it is not a good idea to have literals that look like URIs
without very good reason.

Message-ID: <20101122151647.GM60158@styx.org>

Following up on the earlier announcement [1] that the British Library
[2] has made the British National Bibliography [3] available under a
public domain dedication, the JISC Open Bibliography [4] project has
worked to make this data more useable.

The data has been loaded into a Virtuoso store that is queriable
through the SPARQL Endpoint [5] and the URIs that we have assigned
each record use the ORDF [6] software to make them dereferencable,
supporting perform content auto-negotiation as well as embedding RDFa
in the HTML representation.

The data contains some 3 million individual records and some 173
million triples. Indexing the data was a very CPU intensive process
taking approximately three days. Transforming and loading the source
data took about five hours.

That's what's in the source data, the 111443rd entry in BNBrdfdc12.xml

I have no idea the error rate for problems of this type in the data -
finding that out is a research project in itself. A next step is to
feed it through the link discovery tools at DERI and Berlin (are they
both the same (Silk) or is DERI's something different?) and then see
what kinds of inconsistencies we can find.

A bit easier, what we really need now is a good way to make these
corrections and feed them back into the BL. For the RDF clued like
yourself, I could take a patch in the form of a corrected graph and
put it in the store.

William,

I think it would be best if DC upgraded their vocabularies to OWL to avoid this ambiguity. Here is a suggested start for the overhaul:

:identifier a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
	rdfs:subPropertyOf dcterms:identifier .

:identifierRef a owl:ObjectProperty ;
	rdfs:subPropertyOf dcterms:identifier .

OWL is mentioned a few times in the recent DcamInContext document, but only in relation to application profiles and constraint languages:

http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DcamInContext

I think that OWL should be more fundamental. For example, the DCMI Type vocabulary looks like it should be a plain old OWL ontology suitable for use with rdf:type:

http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/
http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-type-vocabulary/

But is it reliable?  I looked up the book I wrote (Presenting XML, SAMS

How did that happen?

Absolutely, though lets hope it's a random error and not something 
systematic.  I went to download the file in question to have a look, but 
as it's a 450MB XML document, which Firefox is gallantly trying to load 
for me to read, I suspect I will fail.  Any chance of these resources

Richard

I've investigated this issue. As William points out, this has to do with the source data, not the RDF/XML representation or the conversion.

The record you found was created prior to publication for the British National Bibliography (BNB), on the assumption that it would be published in the UK and would be part of the Library's legal deposit intake. It may worth pointing out that records created prior to publication, on the basis of information provided by the publisher, sometimes contain inaccurate data.

The item was however published in the United States and was ineligible for the BNB. The BL subsequently purchased this item; this has been catalogued and correctly attributed. When I searched our "Search our catalogue" under the title "Presenting XML", your book was the first hit.
http://searchbeta.bl.uk/

We will take steps to delete the incorrect record from our catalogue but it will remain in our rdf/xml dataset until we update this data. William may want to delete it from his version of our data set. 

Hope this helps.

Does anyone know what's up with BL adding 10 million records to OCLC?
( See http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/Digest/The-British-Library-Adds--Million-Records-to-WorldCat-71930.asp
). They seem to be going in two directions?toward open data and away
from it.

Does OCLC have any sort of special deal, or are they now subject to
the clauses about not contributing to efforts that undermine OCLC?

I think this shows how potentially complex  some of this is

My personal  opinion (I'm not an expert) is that we shouldn't delete records
but rather mark them as {obsoleted} or something. It's possible that later
it's discovered that something else weird happend to this book and it's very
difficult to search for something that's been deleted.

But I'm sure others know more about this. I'm just so glad that it's already
sparked this discussion.

BTW - we are copied into 3 maillists - we should probably condense this.

Ah: that was probably the person they _wanted_ to write the book ;-)

Thanks for the explanation.  Of course (on reflection!) it shouldn't be 
in the BNB.  Any thoughts on the suggestion of a zip download, or maybe 
FTP support?  I've tried three methods of downloading - all failed 
("file too big", essentially).

Amen to that, Datasets need correction policies and instructions. If you 
make it really painless for people to let you know of issues then it's 
for-the-win-for-all.

The cleaned record, which I would agree should not be deleted but
superceded, can be retrieved as

    http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GB97W9726.rdf 

So what do we do about this? If it won't appear in further corrected
data from the BL, we should mint a new URI for it. This might be
directly in bibliographica.org. The identifier/slug shouldn't be used
because that's the BNB identifier. Easiest thing is just to make a
hash. 

So if you do a search now you'll see two records for that book, the
incorrect one from the original data and a hand-made one based on that
record and what I could easily find with google.

So the new record is at:

    http://bibliographica.org/entry/c4bb7da2c60413acc06f2369746da92b

(anyone with a suggestion about how to make better identifiers please
pipe up).

As far as downloading the source data, I would suggest using wget(1).

Right. There is (as yet) no particular graph there so what happens is
a SPARQL construct for that URI as a subject is done. I've turned on
sameAs processing in the query (only that one) and now it should give
some more useful information. Time will tell how well that scales.

So I'm thinking of trying to point OntoWiki at this to see what
happens. A couple of unknowns here -- there is no "main graph",
basically every major resource has its own graph, this is for
provenance tracking and easy display. Management of permissions will
be interesting to say the least with 3x10^6 or so graphs.

Maybe we could / should keep the writable area in a different store or
at least a different RDF_QUAD table -- haven't tried that yet.

Relatedly, I want to make a dump of the whole thing in trig or
n-quads, I know DB.DBA.TTLP can read these, but I'm having trouble
adapting the dump_graphs() example to this (http_ttl_triple insists on
putting a '.' at the end so nquads doesn't work, and it also doesn't
seem to prefix blank nodes with _: which also breaks things). Do you
have a ready solution to this?

William,

Congrats!

Next step is Data Wiki dimension, courtesy of WebID. This enables group 
maintenance of data i.e., someone spots an error, makes a change e.g. in 
their own named graph, post data space management approval, changes go 
to the main graph, if need be.

Anyway, great stuff! The foundation context for Data Wikis is now taking

Subject: [open-bibliography] Europeana factsheet on Open Linked Data
Message-ID: <AANLkTikijwSN-Ho9NvrcCGwfMctiSBidA49jeT10vP8n@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

as it seems, things are going in a good direction at Europeana. Via
twitter[1] I got aware of an Europeana factsheet on Open Linked Data:
[2]. Here are some quotes:

"Data can be open but not linked. Data can be linked but not open. The
Semantic Web can only function with data which is both open and
linked." (p.1) - This insight isn't self-evident. I know from Germany
that not yet all people agree on this and rather think they can just
do Linked Data without opening it...

"The current non-commercial clause in the data provider agreements
*must be removed* in order to allow Europeana to make its metadata
resources available as Open Linked Data." (p.2) - Hopefully this will
be carried out soon. Does anybody know how far efforts have been made
at Europeana for an actual implementation of insights like this?

"If Europeana and its providers do not enable uses such as this, we
will fall behind in a rapidly changing environment. Wikipedia and
others will take our place as the only available authoritative source
for contextual data. This carries the risk of undermining the position
of cultural heritage institutions as relevant information providers.
When we can supply Open Linked Data to other providers, we will all
benefit by placing ourselves at the forefront of the technology
revolution and establishing ourselves as the trusted and authoritative
source on cultural heritage information." (p.2)

In April Europeana already published a "Public Domain Charter"[3]
adressing the licensing of digitized public domain works as Europeana
content. Has there already been any cooperation on open content or an
exchange of ideas between the OKFN and Europeana?

Adrian

P.S.: BTW, what's going on with the Principles on Open Bibliographic
Data? Europeana would certainly be one organization we should ask to
sign and support them as soon as they are in a stable version. But
until now, nobody answered my post which discusses the principles
draft: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-November/000585.html
I would be glad to pick up the conversation...

William,

In answer to your question:

"Is there a list of changes from the version that we have to 0.3.1?
The reason I ask is that it might be easier (quicker) for us to
basically patch the data in the store than to reload it from scratch
and re-index it again."

I provided the table of changes at the beginning of November. It is also
available from our website together with a sample file. 
http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datasamples.html

Cheers

Corine

The British Library is not a member of OCLC and is therefore not
restricted by any terms which may apply to its membership. The Library
supplies records to a wide variety of union catalogues (e.g. SUNCAT &
COPAC) in order to increase the global visibility of its collections.
Contributing records to OCLC's WorldCat system is simply part of this
wider strategy to improve awareness and usage of the BL's holdings.

Does anyone know what's up with BL adding 10 million records to OCLC?
( See
http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/Digest/The-British-Library-Adds--Million
-Records-to-WorldCat-71930.asp
). They seem to be going in two directions-toward open data and away
from it.

Does OCLC have any sort of special deal, or are they now subject to
the clauses about not contributing to efforts that undermine OCLC?

William,

 

Just had a look at the sample record available at
http://eris.okfn.org/ww/2010/11/bl. I have some comments on the Dublin
Core bit of the record.

 

You reference the @prefix:dc as http://purl.org/dc/terms/

 

This is not correct. It should be:

 

For the legacy namespace, @prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>

For the /terms/ namespace, @prefix dct or dcterms:
<http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

 

The following properties do not exist:

dc:isPartOf; dc:extent; dc:issued

 

They should be:

dcterms:isPartOf; dcterms:extent; dcterms:issued

 

This is not how the British Library submitted the data. See sample at:

http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datasamples.html

 

We mainly made use of Dublin Core properties in the /terms/ namespace;
the only property in the legacy /elements/1.1/ that we used was dc:date.
This is because the range of dcterms:date and its sub-properties is
rdfs:Literal; this didn't allow us to use the Time Ontology in OWL. 

 

Cheers

 

Corine

It is a matter of definition, in the RDF/XML you'll see the full URI

well have been called "wibble" it makes absolutely no difference. (And
you'll often see serialisations where all the namespaces have prefixes

Using the prefix dc for the DC terms namespace is not incorrect, it is
merely unusual. DC terms does include all the 'legacy' terms and extends
it with a number of extra terms.

The reason why many use the dcterms vs dc prefix is by a rough
convention to let other people know that this is using the more up to
date namespace.

However, your point about the range of dc:issued being highly
restrictive is completely fair. Having to go back and use a namespace
that is already declared to be legacy may not be the best way forward.
If anyone has a suggestion as to which predicate we can use instead,
I'll be glad to hear it.

I'm sorry but I still don't understand. I've looked at  http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GB8102507 <http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GB8102507> , which I believe is the RDF/XML you were pointing me to. 
 
The Dublin Core namespace declaration still doesn't make sense to me. As stated before in this email string and based on the data we submitted, my understanding is that there should be two namespace declarations, one for the legacy namespace prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>, one for the /terms/ namespace prefix:dct <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.  They are two different namespaces. The /terms/ namespace does not include the "legacy" terms; the 15 legacy properties have been "copied" into the /terms/ namespace, they are new properties with formally declared domains and ranges as explained in "Notes on DCMI specifications for Dublin Core metadata in RDF" [1]. 
 
All Dublin Core properties used in the BNB dataset should use the prefix dct: except one, dc:date. 
 
I would appreciate some input from DCMI which is why I have copied a couple of DCMI colleagues.
 
Many thanks in advance for explaining.
 
Best regards

Using the prefix dc for the DC terms namespace is not incorrect, it is
merely unusual. DC terms does include all the 'legacy' terms and extends
it with a number of extra terms.

The reason why many use the dcterms vs dc prefix is by a rough
convention to let other people know that this is using the more up to
date namespace.

However, your point about the range of dc:issued being highly
restrictive is completely fair. Having to go back and use a namespace
that is already declared to be legacy may not be the best way forward.
If anyone has a suggestion as to which predicate we can use instead,
I'll be glad to hear it.

This is different from the output from my conversion scripts, for
example:

http://pastebin.com/pkBncJPu

Will, can you shed any light on why the two namespaces have been
combined?

Also, in examining the example I linked to above, I noticed it created
an End of the interval of "9999", even though the original shows an
undefined end point, in this case defined by "[2000?]-". I think this is
a situation where omission is far better than the use of a value like
9999. The interval makes perfect sense upon removal of the hasEnd node
IMO.

That one doesn't appear to have a dces:date. This one does:

http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GB5011841.rdf

Most of them also have dc:issued which is converted to a proper date
(typed literal) where possible.

They haven't. We just call the legacy namespace dces and the current
ones dc. Please don't get hung up on the prefixes used, they're
entirely arbitrary. (I didn't realise it could cause this much

I certainly agree. This is in the data we received, right? I'm pretty
sure I haven't seen anything we do that invents arbitrary dates.

Ah, it's in dces:date :)

Yep, I meant the original conversion from MARC to the BL's exported RDF,

Corine,

 

You are right that the fifteen properties of the Dublin Core Metadata
Element Set version 1.1 are in the purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/ namespace
without domains and ranges defined and that there are parallel
properties in the purl.org/dc/terms/ namespace with domains and ranges.
The parallel terms have different URIs because they are semantically
different.

 

Usually people use the prefix dc: for the ?legacy? namespace and
dcterms: or dct: for the terms namespace. As William points out it
really doesn?t matter; on the other hand, using different prefixes from
common practice can create confusion. It would be perfectly legal to
declare:

 

xmlns:foaf="http://purl.org/dc/terms/"
xmlns:dcterms="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/"

 

(as a reductio ad absurdum, just joking of course). My personal take on
this is that it is advisable to adhere to common practice unless there
is a very pressing need to do otherwise.

 

Makx.

I'm sorry but I still don't understand. I've looked at
<http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GB8102507>
http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GB8102507, which I believe is the
RDF/XML you were pointing me to. 

 

The Dublin Core namespace declaration still doesn't make sense to me. As
stated before in this email string and based on the data we submitted,
my understanding is that there should be two namespace declarations, one
for the legacy namespace prefix dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>,
one for the /terms/ namespace prefix:dct <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>.
They are two different namespaces. The /terms/ namespace does not
include the ?legacy? terms; the 15 legacy properties have been "copied"
into the /terms/ namespace, they are new properties with formally
declared domains and ranges as explained in "Notes on DCMI
specifications for Dublin Core metadata in RDF" [1]. 

 

All Dublin Core properties used in the BNB dataset should use the prefix
dct: except one, dc:date. 

 

I would appreciate some input from DCMI which is why I have copied a
couple of DCMI colleagues.

 

Many thanks in advance for explaining.

 

Best regards

 

Corine

Using the prefix dc for the DC terms namespace is not incorrect, it is
merely unusual. DC terms does include all the 'legacy' terms and extends
it with a number of extra terms.

The reason why many use the dcterms vs dc prefix is by a rough
convention to let other people know that this is using the more up to
date namespace.

However, your point about the range of dc:issued being highly
restrictive is completely fair. Having to go back and use a namespace
that is already declared to be legacy may not be the best way forward.
If anyone has a suggestion as to which predicate we can use instead,
I'll be glad to hear it.

I had a good chat with Mary R from europeana local about the wider
question of OKFN/Europeana cooperation at the recent ISKO event in
london. My recollection is we left it with Mary speaking to a few
people up the europeana food chain on my behalf. I'll chase Mary.

I think this loops back to the previous question about how we position
ourselves wrt existing efforts (Thanks Mia for saying you thought
there was some merit in that btw). We really need to develop good
convincing arguments why the licensing is (a) so important and (b) not
going to cost the earth to implement. Many of these institutions are
already sharing data and content on a very successful, but ultimately,
informal basis. IMHO cultural institutions are already well advanced
on the "Open" agenda. The problem for us is that promoting
open-licenses, without being able to easily piggy-back the argument on
"open access" (Lower case intentional) is tricky (And potentially
boring as heck).

Not sure that makes much sense, it was clearer in my head :/

@ Makx. Many thanks for your explanation. I think I've just demonstrated that "using different prefixes from common practice can create confusion" ;-)

@William, yes the 9999 comes from MARC practice. The data mapped to dc:date comes from the 008. For a continuing resource, the beginning date of publication is contained in 008/07-10 and 008/11-14 contain the characters 9999.

I have one last question about the comment made in a previous post about the URN:ISBN "additionally it is uncommon th uppercase the prefix there, and case does matter."

I've looked at RFC 2141 about the URN syntax
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt

In it, there are the following statements: 
"The leading "urn:" sequence is case-insensitive" (section 2); 
"Further, the Namespace Identifier is case insensitive, so that "ISBN" and "isbn" refer to the same namespace." (section 2.1).  

Under section 6, it is said that the following three statements are lexically equivalent: URN:foo:a123,456; urn:foo:a123,456, and urn:FOO:a123,456.

So in what way does case matter? Is it because it is common practice to lower case the prefix and applications have been built on that basis? 

Again many thanks for answering my question. I'm trying to learn.

Cheers

Corine

Yep, I meant the original conversion from MARC to the BL's exported RDF,

I spent some time talking to people and trying to find a best practice. 
I suggest that the powers that be at DC should pick between dct: 
dcterms: etc. and just put one in big letters at the top of the HTML and 
RDF description!

There's vann:preferredNamespacePrefix 
<http://graphite.ecs.soton.ac.uk/browser/?uri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.org%2Fvocab%2Fvann%2FpreferredNamespacePrefix#http://purl.org/vocab/vann/preferredNamespacePrefix> 
for linking a namespace to the preferred prefix. We should lobby DC to 
add it to the formal definition. I really don't care which, but they 
should just pick one. dct gains points for brevity.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Place of Publication data from the BL dataset
Message-ID: <1290683815.2818.254.camel@monster>

I've pulled out the place of publication(?) data (isbd:P1016) from the
BL BNB dataset and compiled it into a sorted spreadsheet, focussed on
the locations:

http://bit.ly/g2l2tM

Due to google's limitations, I've broken the spreadsheet up into 12.

sortedlocations0-12 ->

"0" - "00:0/0" to "Birmingham] ([Red House, Hill Lane, Great Barr,
Birmingham B43 6LZ])"

"1" - "Birmingham] ([Reference Library, Birmingham B3 3HQ])" to "Cheadle
(266 Councillor La., Cheadle, Cheshire)"

"2" - "Cheadle (266 Councillor La., Cheadle, Cheshire SK8 5PN)" to
"Dunmow (37 The Close, Dunmow, Essex CM6 1EN)"

"3" - "Dunmow]" to "Grand Rapids, Miss"

"4" - "Grand Rapids, MI, USA" to "Kirkcudbright (77 High St.,
Kirkcudbright DG6 4JW)"

"5" - "Kirkcudbright (Tongland, Kirkcudbright)" to "London (19 Cornwall
Terrace, NW1 4QP)"

"6" - "London (19 Douglas St., London, SW1P 4PA)" to "London (6 Hugh
St., Pimlico, London SW1V 1RP)"

"7" - "London (6 Hugo St., London, SW1V 1RP)" to "London (Scorpio House,
106 Church Rd., London SE19 2UB)"

"8" - "London (Scorpio House, 106 Church Rd., London SE19 2UB)" to
"Newport (National Foaling Bank, Meretown Stud, Newport, Salop)"

"9" - "Newport (Newbridge Works Ltd, Chepstow Rd, Newport, Gwent NP5
4TW)" to "Research Section, Dublin"

"10" - "Research Studies Press" to "St. Sampson"

"11" - "St. Sampson] Guernsey" to "Wolverhampton (50 Queen St.,
Wolverhampton WV1 3BU)"

"12" - "Wolverhampton (59 Waterloo Rd, Wolverhampton W1V 4QT)" to
"Zwolle"

The grouping of locations is done purely by exact string matching, so as
not to interfere with the data too much at this point.

Eg 'London' is not equal to 'London]' or 'London (14 C...)'

Also note, that many records have multiple P1016 values.

I can perform a full export of this, so that each row has a full list of
GB Ids in which the location occurs, but it will overload GDocs, and a
number of normal spreadsheet programs so best used programatically.

Note that this set is just to aid you in exploring the data held in
bnb.bibliographica.org and to help avoid DoS from too many location
lookups! :)

This is great to see. I had some difficulty however when I tried to harvest the spreadsheets for
closer inspection.  I also been experimenting with Google Docs as a means of publishing machine-readable
spreadsheet data, and found that by clicking "publish to the web" I was able to expose csv files such as this
one
https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=0Ai_sd71RSo30dFoteW1MSS1KRWx6dVFQTW1JdnNVYWc&hl=en&output=csv
which can be accessed programatically e.g. using python urllib.urlopen()  without any complaint from Google.
I tried to guess the corresponding access url for one of your spreads, but could not make it work.
Please could you provide a list of 12 simple urls like the above from which the data can be pulled for closer inspection
by a simple python script?

I am very interested in the issue of how best to go about cleaning data like this, especially the use of crowdsourcing
for such purposes, and the provision of efficient workflows and tools for experts to work on it.
Two promising resources for such refinement exercises are

http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/
Google Refine is a power tool for working with messy data, cleaning it up, transforming it from one format into another, extending it with web services, and linking it to databases like Freebase. 

http://www.needlebase.com/
Needle is a revolutionary platform for acquiring, integrating, cleansing, analyzing and publishing data on the web.  Using Needle through a web browser, without programmers or DBAs, 
your data team can easily:
* acquire data from multiple sources:  A simple tagging process quickly imports structured data from complex websites, XML feeds, and spreadsheets into a unified database of your design.
* merge, deduplicate and cleanse: Needle uses intelligent semantics to help you find and merge variant forms of the same record.  Your merges, edits and deletions persist even after the original data is refreshed from its source.
* build and publish custom data views: Use Needle's visual UI and powerful query language to configure exactly your desired view of the data, whether as a list, table, grid, or map.  Then, with one click, publish the data for others to see, or export a feed of the clean data to your own local database.
Needle dramatically reduces the time, cost, and expertise needed to build and maintain comprehensive databases of practically anything. 

A general tool for crowdsourcing is https://www.mturk.com/mturk/

Some questions:

Does anyone on this list have experience using these tools? 
What other tools might be considered for this purpose?
How to manage the choice and application of such tools for big jobs like cleaning the BL data?
How can such jobs be done collaboratively so we dont end up with muliple copies of the data, each improved in some respect from the original, but not easily merged to obtain improvement in all respects?
Who decides what is an improvement?
Who is willing to host and maintain the improved dataset?

This is a little pet tool I've been working on. Source available on

A spreadsheet instead of a word processing document would definitely
be easier to deal with.  It would also allow direct import into Google
Refine.

...
> Does anyone on this list have experience using these tools?

I wrote the Google Spreadsheets importer for Google Refine and was an
early beta user of Needle.  I'd be happy to answer questions on
either.  Neither of them really have any direct support for
collaborative data cleanup.  Pretty much all division of labor and
coordination needs to be managed externally.  One of the reasons I
added the Google Spreadsheets support was so that these cloud based
sources could be used as a rudimentary sharing mechanism.

One of the difficulties of the current dataset is that it has no URIs
assigned and very few strong identifiers of any type that can be used
as handles to reference things.  You could, for example, go through
the extracted publication places and group duplicates together using
Google Refine, but you'd have no way to use that cleaned data set to
improve the original or any of the extracted copies.

As for the overall workflow, what's missing, in my opinion, is a
crowdsourcing framework that allows the creation of simple 'data
games' similar the old Freebase games (e.g. Genderizer, Typewriter,
etc) but without the requirement for in-depth technical expertise and
custom programming.  It should be possible for a domain expert to set
up a queue of tasks that are simple enough to be crowdsource and to
get the tasks into the queue and the results back out again in a
simple and straightforward manner.  The two main things that need to
be done are 1) cluster duplicate variants together and 2) reconcile
things with a source of strong identifiers such as Freebase, DBpedia,
or the Library of Congress.

Tom

p.s. Personally, I think having the data pulled out of context
actually makes it harder to use, not easier.  If I look at the string
'Cambridge,' it could represent pretty much any place, but if I can
see what book was published there, I can probably guess whether it's
the town across the river from Boston or someplace off on an island
across the ocean.

Indeed. One of the reasons I didn't invent unique URIs for the places
when doing the first step of transformation for what is in
http://bnb.bibliographica.org/ would be that in effect that would just
be a process of skolemisation -- not very helpful.

However, suppose you look at a book and figure out in whatever way
that it was published in Cambridge, Ontario (for argument's sake),
what is necessary to hook that on the records is ultimately a SPARQL
query that looks like,

INSERT INTO <book_uri>
 { ?place owl:sameAs <http://sws.geonames.org/5913695/> }
WHERE
 { <book_uri> isbd:hasPlaceOfPublicationProductionDistribution ?place }

Or even better, loop over all books with the same publisher and place
name label and perform the same operation.

This way, using owl:sameAs like this to ground a blank node is a first
step in disambiguation. It only adds a piece of information and
doesn't remove anything. Once we are sure enough that this is correct, 
we can go and replace the blank node with the URI which is a more
invasive operation because it involves deleting statements.

If we can get there, some sort fun game that people can play that
creates SPARQL queries like this, we can fix the data.

The nice thing is, when we record provenance (changes) we can keep
around these queries that were done. They are much clearer and
understandable (especially if they become only slightly more elaborate
than the one above) than the brute-force transaction journal
(changeset) approach to provenance.

Do the original records have the place of publication code from the  
fixed field? That provides the country (and in some cases country +  
state or province). It could be used to disambiguate place names in  
the publisher area.

I guess my email was a bit tl;dr - at the bottom of it I tried to point out
that these spreadsheets are meant as a guide to the sorts of data within the
dataset.

Corine, if you could take a look at the aforementioned data, specifically
the first sheet (sortedlocations0) which may indicate errors in either the
data or the conversion.

What I do want to discuss is the data itself. There are a great many direct
addresses with postcodes. So what might we do to make this more usable?
(Without spending too long on this)

- insert 'publishedNear' data, encapsulating the cities information?
- try to reduce the addresses to a lat-lon?
- something else?
- nothing at all?

Again, the spreadsheet was aimed at helping the exploration of the data. The
idea was you would spot something odd, click the link to get to
bnb.bibliographica and then start to characterise it on that service.

Ben, Edward Betts did some interesting work on disambiguating (or not,  
as is often the case) publishers using the ISBN prefixes. Obviously,  
it only helps when you have an ISBN... he also did some stats on  
country of publication. You can find various links here:

http://edwardbetts.com/ol/

The one relating ISBN codes and publisher names is:

http://edwardbetts.com/ol/isbn_publisher_codes

I find these kinds of studies absolutely fascinating, in part because  
they point out how ambiguous our library data really is, often because  
it's a funny world, publishing is.

I guess my email was a bit tl;dr - at the bottom of it I tried to point
out that these spreadsheets are meant as a guide to the sorts of data
within the dataset.

Corine, if you could take a look at the aforementioned data,
specifically the first sheet (sortedlocations0) which may indicate
errors in either the data or the conversion.

What I do want to discuss is the data itself. There are a great many
direct addresses with postcodes. So what might we do to make this more
usable? (Without spending too long on this)

- insert 'publishedNear' data, encapsulating the cities information?
- try to reduce the addresses to a lat-lon?
- something else?
- nothing at all?

Again, the spreadsheet was aimed at helping the exploration of the data.
The idea was you would spot something odd, click the link to get to
bnb.bibliographica and then start to characterise it on that service.

The conversion currently takes the place of publication, distribution,
etc. from the 260$a. We're considering including the 008/15-17 in future
releases.

Do the original records have the place of publication code from the  
fixed field? That provides the country (and in some cases country +  
state or province). It could be used to disambiguate place names in  
the publisher area.

Minting URIs for your copy of the data is too late in the process to
be helpful anyway.  What's needed to is to have the original data
export include any available identifiers.

That's assuming that the place of publication is stored on a
per-publisher basis, not a per-book basis in the British Library
database.  That type of knowledge about the schema used in the
internal database will be key to making informed decisions about the
data.  Where is that schema documented?

The process you described fixes your *copy* of the data.  It doesn't
fix my copy or Karen's copy, and it certainly doesn't help the
original data.  Without identifiers in the original data, it
complicates merging everyone's independent improvement results (as Jim
pointed out).

What does that mean in English?

Is there a listing available someplace of what fields in the dump came
from free form text fields vs database records which guarantee that
anything linked to that record always has the same text value?  For
example, book titles and edition statements are almost certainly
free-form text fields, but I'd expect authors to have individual
records where every book linked to the same record to have the same
author name in the dump.

Is there a comprehensive list of which fields are free-form vs
database record backed?  Knowing the internal schema would be very
helpful in making use of the data.

That makes sense, although I'd have thought that publisher data is
noisy enough and low value enough that it'd be pretty far down on the
priority list to clean up.

More interesting I think is whether these text strings represent one
author or three or ...:

  Wilson, Angus, 1913-1991
  Wilson, Angus, 1913-1991,
  Wilson, Angus, 1913-1991.
  Wilson, Angus.
  Willson, Angus.

My gut tells me that at least the first three text strings probably
represent a single author, but that's not what the database seems to
think.

Tom

p.s. Can some librarian type tell me what the trailing period (full
stop) means?  It's not used consistently, but it appears much, MUCH
more frequently in library data than anywhere else I've seen.

Right, I was unsure which dataset you were referring to. My point was
that if the BL were to mint URIs for the records that would be enough
to ground the other blank nodes (author, publisher, place, etc).

Hi Corine, this is helpful, thank you. I had hoped for a list of the

that when you make updates to the data you need only send us the

Assuming that BL data follows the MARC format, the schema is "documented" at:
   http://loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/ecbdhome.html

All of the fields that begin with "00" (zero zero) are coded data with  
fixed value vocabularies.

If you look at this page, along the left-hand side you will see a  
heading for MARC Code lists, with some lists, including geographic  
codes, there:
    http://www.loc.gov/marc/

If you want to grab the lists of MARC fields, subfields and codes  
lists, this page (about 2/3 of the way down) has information about and  
links to two csv files that contain the MARC data elements:
   http://futurelib.pbworks.com/w/page/13686649/Data-and-Studies

There is not an official machine-usable schema for the format, unfortunately.

:-) that they would include the 2-3 letter georgraphic code from field  
008 positions 15-17. Those are the codes listed at:
    http://www.loc.gov/marc/countries/cou_home.html

The Library of Congress, the owner of these vocabularies, has not  
provided an RDF expression for the country codes. There is one,  
however, at:
    http://marccodes.heroku.com/countries/

It's "unofficial" but there are no other RDF options that I know of.

Mathias,

Just noticed this:

http://twitter.com/#!/presroi/status/8145024818618370

"#glamwiki Jill Cousins: #Europeana's metadata will move to CC0 1.0
Universal Public Domain in 2011 ... early 2011. hurray!"

This is unbelievably great news for open data about works! Do you have
any further details / links / etc?
