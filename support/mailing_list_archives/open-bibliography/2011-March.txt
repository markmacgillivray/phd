Hi all,

Peter Murray-Rust just pointed out to me that the data released by TIB
in Germany is under a non-commercial license - meaning it technically
isn't really open data [1]. ;-)

http://www.tib-hannover.de/en/the-tib/opendata/
http://www.tib-hannover.de/fileadmin/dokumentlieferung/openaccess/TIB-OA-2011-01-17-engl.pdf

Does anyone know who was responsible for licensing the data? Is it
worth getting in touch with them about this?

All the best,

Jonathan

I contacted them a week ago and asked for a copy of the data under CC0
or CC-by-sa. The Deputy Director replied and asked for the use case,
which I explained (wikipedia, yadda yadda, free). She said that she
wants to reply the week after the CeBIT exhibition in Hannover.

This looks very promising - they specifically cite the Open Bibliographic
Principles so we - and particularly Adrian - can feel very pleased.

We are already engaged in the JISCOpenbib project.

I hope this will spread virally to other libraries.

Hi,

As per an earlier conversation regarding copyright issues with abstracts, I
spoke to a New Zealand lawyer about the copyright act of NZ and how it
allows copying and distributing abstracts. The goal was to see whether there
would be a benefit in housing the Open Bib data to take advantage of that
copyright exemption.

He agrees that this is the case, and that my interpretation of the article
in the copyright law was correct.

However, there are limitations:

When for example copying an abstract online in New Zealand one needs to
comply not only with NZ copyright law but also with the copyright law of the
country in which the abstract was originally published (that is the
journal's country). If country A allows to copy/distribute abstracts, then
publishing it on a new zealand server is ok. If country B does not permit
the distribution/copy of the abstract then it cannot be  posted online in
NZ.

However there would be one advantage of putting the open bibliography on NZ
jurisdiction rather than UK jurisdiction. For the case of a journal
published in country B (that does not allow for copy/distribution) the
abstract could not be posted in neither UK or a NZ site. However, for a
journal published in country A (that allows copy/distribution under their
copyright law), the journal would still be able to request the UK crown to
apply for the restriction clause in the UK copyright act preventing the
abstracts from being posted in the UK. Since NZ copyright law does not have
a provision similar to that of the UK, then the only way that a journal from
country A would be able to prevent the abstract from being published in NZ
would be by changing their country's copyright law.

Posted in New Zealand means on a server in NZ and a .nz domain. If this is
something that would be considered I could bring it up to the Creative
Commons Aotearoa New Zealand and ask whether they would be able to host the
data. I was also told that there would have to be an 'administrator of the
site' and other legalities that would have to be considered but not worth
trying to get my head around that unless this option is seriously
considered.

I hope this makes some sense. If not, would be happy to try to clarify.

Creative Commons New Zealand Aotearoa will meet on Friday (your thursday),
but of course, it can always be brought up at a later time.

Cheers
Fabiana

I'm project manager on the COMET project and work at the UL in 
Cambridge. I've had some initial contact with Rufus but this looks like 
a good time to stop lurking here and say hello!

Content and licensing for the project output is still being finalised, 
but where possible, we intend to follow suit on JISCOpenbib and use 
PDDL. A key part of the project will be exploring the options available 
for a library when this is not yet feasible and use this to raise 
awareness of the issues related to data ownership.

We are also looking at the ordf/open-biblio suite, so my colleagues will 
be posting on the dev-list as well.

Subject: [open-bibliography] COMET
Message-ID: <4D6E32A0.1060407@caret.cam.ac.uk>

Dear all,

I'm involved with the CUL COMET project in a dev capacity.

We've spoken to Rufus and are examining OKFN openbiblio at the moment 
for MARC import (just setting up a box right now) as well as addressing 
issues like IPR-cleanness etc of our data, structuring URL space, and 
tinkering with the structure of any string values to make them maximally 
compatible.

We already have one migration into RDF (via SIMILE's MARC->MODES->RDF 
pipeline, which was only a 10 line perl script and a couple of XSLTs 
which they supplied), but think we can do better, hence the focus on 
openbiblio, particularly in terms of being compatible in vocabularies 
with the rest of the open library world.

The project lead is Ed Chamberlain, who's very approachable, so if 
anyone's interested do drop him a line.

We hope to shamelessly adopt as much existing practice as possible.

I'm not on this list myself (your mail came to me via a circuitous 
route), but I do hang out on openbilbio-dev.

Dan.

It was really great to see this announcement. I hope that where Cambridge
leads the world will follow. I know that after the release of the principles
there was a slight feeling of anticlimax - a natural lag time. This is a
really rapid practical response.

We realise this is complex. This is not a binary logic - yesYouCan,
noYouCant, but also includes murk and mumble. Differential management of
content (Open, notSure, Closed) is hard. I probably can't help in detail but
you have my moral support.

Hello,

I posted the minutes of yesterday's meeting to openbiblio.net, see
http://openbiblio.net/2011/03/02/minutes-9th-virtual-meeting-of-the-okfn-openbiblio-group/

I also want to make clear that anybody being active - practically or
theoretically - in the open bibliographic data realm is invited to
post on openbiblio.net.

So, if you want to share your thoughts on open bibliographic data, run
a project that involves opening up bibliographic data or do a
presentation about open bibliographic data post about it at
openbiblio.net.

Also, we are happy to add more open bibliographic data projects to
http://openbiblio.net/p/. I just added lobid.org and COMET. I think we
should definitely add the open bibliographic data guide
(http://obd.jisc.ac.uk/) somewhere too. In the project list? Or
somewhere else?

Excellent - thanks Adrian!

I was also wondering recently whether openbiblio.net should aim to
offer people an introduction to open bibliographic data as well as
giving info on what this working group and others are up to in this
area. Would it be worth having some info on this on the main landing
page and moving the blog to openbiblio.net/blog?

Also I wonder whether in the medium term we want something like a very
short film explaining what open bibliographic data is and why it
matters, aimed at librarians, possible users of the data, and the
general public. What do you think?

All the best,

Jonathan

Dear all,

In our report, we should consider Dan's eloquent
reflections on the reception of RDF (below).

For example: "If you're used to XML or SQL schema structures,
the schema designer is typically (not necessarily) in a much
more authoritative role. With RDFS we stripped a lot of power
away from schema designers: they can't tell you what to do
any more! There's no "a shipping order *must* have an address"
mechanism in RDFS/OWL"...

It would be great to have some educational materials. A HUGE amount of  
education needs to be done, iin particular to explain the benefits of  
OpenBib. The W3C LLD group will be addressing some of that as an  
issue, but not coming up with solutions.

The short video done by Freebase on linking
   http://wiki.freebase.com/wiki/What_is_Freebase%3F
is excellent. But I admit I don't have the talent...

Librarians are so sensible :-). One wrote and suggested that our  
principles document should have a date and possibly a version number.  
He's right. In fact, ALL documents should have dates/versions, but for  
sure we should add a date to the principles.

Any objections?

This event is going to inform how galleries, libraries, archives and museums
across the UK (esp. the HE sector) engage with opening up their data, how
that data is delivered, and what can be achieved with the data - I hope that
some of you can make it

*How can we gain bigger audiences for our scholarly and cultural resources
and enhance services for researchers, teachers and learners? *

In 2010, the JISC and RLUK Resource Discovery Taskforce (RDTF), involving
national stakeholders from libraries, archives and museums, set out a vision
for making the most of UK scholarly and cultural resources.  JISC and their
RDTF partners have now committed to a programme of activity to help fulfil
the vision ? building critical mass through opening up data, exploring and
demonstrating what open data makes possible, and actively sharing learning
points with the wider community.

*The ?Opening Data ? Opening Doors? event marks the starting point of this
journey.  *

Chaired by Professor David Baker, Deputy Chair of the JISC Board, on behalf
of the JISC and RLUK Resource Discovery Task Force

?         Hear from services that are opening up their data including what?s
happening in the new RDTF projects that have just been commissioned

?         Help to shape the messages, advice and support offered during the
2011 programme and beyond

?         Help to develop practical and engaging approaches to exploiting
our data



Venue: Malmaison Manchester, Piccadilly, Manchester, M1 1LZ

Date: Monday 18th April 2011, 10.00am to 4.00pm



*Who should attend?* Managers, practitioners, developers and advocates from
libraries, archives, museums, associated publishers and interested
organisations who want early involvement in clarifying, expanding and
challenging the realities of exposing, sharing and exploiting the resource
description data held by our institutions.



*Register at:* <http://rdtf-opening-doors.eventbrite.com/>

Are the principles on bitbucket or similar? Because if so we get automatic
(serial) versioning and dating.

Great to see!  Mathias or Adrian (or other volunteer), please could you could make a brief English translation of the
appened BLOG post and send to Adrian to post as a news item in the open biblio site?

Do we have a structured list of announcements like this, with dates, organizations, number of records, some description of content?
We should have a systematic way of maintaining and displaying such a list. I'll be glad to assist with this. It is very desirable
for each such data release for OKFN to have a  technical contact with the organization, who may be responsive to details of licensing, 
updates and the like. I think this working group should aim to have someone who is responsible for keeping up each such  contact, and also
someone responsible for monitoring the list of all pairs of contacts. The email list of all these pairs would be a simple and
powerful means of maintaining a sense of community among providers of open biblio data. Such a network, if only initially a star shaped one with 
an OKFN admin volunteer at the center, would be a significant start towards the "Bibliographic Knowledge Network" imagined  as the product of
the NSF sponsored BKN grant effort (url below). Funding for that grant is winding down, and I would like to see the code and data assets it generated
finding good homes. So I am proposing that the BKN name be coopted by OKFN and administered by some subset of this working group as
a name for a network of OKFN compliant openbiblio data providers, overseen by OKFN.

I will be discussing this plan further with Rufus and Jonathan next week. If you have any reactions/suggestions, please
post to the list or to one of us privately.

The open data by Dortmund (not Darmstadt) university library is
another data release by a library from the hbz library network where I
work. We don't collect the announcements but provide descriptions of
the released data here:

> We should have a systematic way of maintaining and displaying such a list. I'll be glad to assist with this.

We've already got the bibliographic data group in CKAN which already
provides information about maintainers and could be used to gather
more information: http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic We decided in
the last meeting to somehow integrate it into openbiblio.net...

Cheers

[copied to OKF's Open Bibliographic list, where the work was inspired and
took place] :-) What am I to say?

Taking the Panton Principles for Data (http://pantonprinciples.org/) as a
lead, Adrian Pohl got a few of us together and over the months the
Principles for Open Bibliographic Data emerged. It's not been trivial to
define Open Bibliography but I think we are all agreed that the core is
Open.

Moreover I have been in contact with the STM publishers (see
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/02/04/bibliographic-data-is-open/ ) and
they have agreed that they agree with this. That gives us a useful legal
reference if we wish to start annotating documents with Bibliography (which
is part of what we intend to do at our upcoing BtPDF-inspired hackfest).

The immediate difficulty is that there are few - if any - Open collections
of bibliographic data (Scopus, WorldOfScience, Mendeley... are not Open). A
collection of Open bibliographic items is not by default Open (in fact by
default it is the copyright of the compiler). We may not like this (I don't)
but it seems to be the law. Note that by default NO citation iformation is
Open unless it comes from an Open Access or Open Data resource. That's a
major barrier to modern scholarship, but that's the way it seems to be... It
means we cannot follow citation trails without the explicit permission of
the "owners" (a word deliberately in quotes).

So in the hackfest we are going to use alternative Open collections of
biliographic data. No, I'm not going to announce how. Maybe you should come
to the hackfest.

But we are appealing to anyone who has collections of bibliographic data to
make them Open. Even a smallish collection can be valuable - it could be the
definitive resource for a given area of scholarship. Typical examples could
be reading lists or reference lists from key resources.

Note of course that an Open bibliographic collection can (and unfortunately
usually does) point to closed resources. But maybe that's better than
nothing?

Hello,

I just published a post on openbiblio.net about using IsItOpenData to
enquire data providers about their licensing policies:
http://openbiblio.net/2011/03/07/is-it-open-bibliographic-data/

We are currently using IsItOpenData to find out more about the
licensing status of 3lib data and should soon make the remaining
enquiries. Jim, you write on the etherpad[1] that you can help with
arxiv.org and Current Index of Statistics. I could help writing the
enquiries but perhaps there is someone on this list who is more
engaged with these services (e.g. as a user) and thus a better fit for
sending the enquiries. (HAL and SPIRES are also left to enquire.)

All the best,
Adrian

Right. I have initiated an exchange with David Ruddy of Cornell, he replied:

>Regarding the use of arXiv OAI metadata, here is our current statement:
http://arxiv.org/help/oa/metadataPolicy

"Metadata for arXiv articles may be reused in non-commercial and commercial systems. Links to download full-text should point back to arXiv.org."  

Does that qualify by OKFN standards?

David continued
"What we are now exploring is whether the license the author agrees to would allow us to attach a CC0 license to the metadata. It's not clear, but if we can, we would like to do that on our end. There are some reasonably strong feelings that arXiv ought to be the entity that puts the CC0 license on the data, not others. Obviously, if we do it, then you can do what you wish with the metadata. We will be talking with our intellectual property officer about this soon. I will be in touch as soon as I get some clarification."

>and Current Index of Statistics. 

I have initiated dicussion with IMS first about a list of about 1000 IMS-related people profiles
which is another dataset on 3lib and people.bibkn.org. I am aiming to get IMS to agree this 
is CC0 and to work with me to maintain and develop it. I do think we should try to address 
dataset maintenence as well as asking for CC0 dumps. When the issue of people profiles is resolved,
I'll continue with discussion of CIS data.

Hi all,
I write to you on behalf of the Public Domain Working Group. We are
currently working on enhancing and expanding the collection of works
available at www.publicdomainworks.net - a registry of artistic works that
are in the public domain. In order to do that, we need to gain access to a
maximum of information concerning works of different kinds (in particular,
the author, the date of birth and death, the date of publication, etc).
While we already have a proper database for bibliographic works, we
areinterested in getting metadata for as many different kinds of works
as
possible.
We are currently trying to figure out where we can find metadata about works
other than books or other written publications, which is currently provided
by the Bibliographica team. In particular, I would like to know what kind of
metadata do library catalogues often contain? how good is the quality? and
who would you suggest we contact in order to obtain the metadata we are
looking for.
Looking forward to your answer,
Primavera

Assuming there are no hidden restrictions I take this to mean that any
amount (including all) can be downloaded (subject only to considerate
robots).  OK

Assuming that re-use is without explicit permission and for whatever legal
purpose. OK

Links to download full-text should point back to arXiv.org."

It is possible to create re-usable objects without linkiing back (e.g. a
list of author names). However if the metadata is to be used in a full
bibliography sense it SHOULD identify the full-text object with an agreed
Arxiv identifier. It addition it MAY provide a navigable link to the
full-text in which case the link SHOULD point to the actual item in the
Arxiv. (Nothing else makes sense unless there are copies of the full-text
elsewhere).

I don't know what the Arxiv policy is on copying full-text but assuming it
is allowed it seems highly desirable that the metadata should point to the
Arxiv.

Does that qualify by OKFN standards?

Arxiv is mainly for science. The STM publishers have agreed that
bibliographic metadata per se is uncopyrightable. Since the author is
handing over a single bibliographic entry s/he does not have copyright over
this. So I see no reason why Arxiv should not add CC0 (or PDDL) and every
reason why they should. (This excludes abstracts and full-text)

I've certainly added OAI (And other streaming protocol) based datasets
to CKAN, wasn't aware of any restriction. I just used the base URL of
the OAI server. Is this an official line? If so it needs to be
challenged and changed (IMNSHO).

If we can co-draft a brief script together at some point, then I can
see if I can find someone to help put together a short film!

Suggest we put this on the backburner for now.

At the highest level, standard library catalog data types are (from  
the documentation):

a - Language material
c - Notated music
d - Manuscript notated music
e - Cartographic material
f - Manuscript cartographic material
g - Projected medium
i - Nonmusical sound recording
j - Musical sound recording
k - Two-dimensional nonprojectable graphic
m - Computer file
o - Kit
p - Mixed materials
r - Three-dimensional artifact or naturally occurring object
t - Manuscript language material

Libraries focus on "fixed and published" items, so there are few  
paintings, sculptures, etc. Most library materials are ones that are  
reproduced, like books, musical recordings, sheet music, films. (And  
obviously few non-print-on-paper items are in the public domain.)  
Archives are more likely to have photographs than libraries are. Their  
metadata, however, often does not record information about individual  
items (e.g. individual photographs), but about a collection as a  
whole. I don't know much about the state of museum metadata.

Message-ID: <AANLkTin1u9wWpWaVokZ9Vuf7vWRy-aCrHTrUKPON1+PW@mail.gmail.com>

Great,

open bibliographic data from libraries seems to get attention in the
broader realm of Public Sector Information/Open Government Data. The
European Public Sector Information (PSI) Platform has published a post
on the data release by Dortmund University Library, see [1].
Obviously, they've read openbiblio.net.

Quote:

"In the German states North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) and Lower Saxony an
important part of the PSI re-use debate is pushed by those involved
with university libraries. So it is interesting to note there is
another university, the University of Dortmund, that is now opening up
its bibliographic data for re-use, and allows download of the entire
dataset, bringing it under a Creative Commons zero license."

I think that's a great development. Hopefully libraries can be
catalysts for Open Government Data in Germany. Obviously, in UK it's
the other way round as there already is an evolving Open Data
infrastructure (which Germany lacks) where libraries are now following
ther public institutions by releasing their data.

Cheers
Adrian

Message-ID: <AANLkTingAK489+6rU1uEMqjVV+BJ7wnHWM29JshfKJ+u@mail.gmail.com>

Our hackfest at the weekend (
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2011/03/14/scholarly-html-%E2%80%93-major-progress/)
was a deliberate and logical continuation of the "Writing" stream at
#beyondthepdf in January. Martin Fenner and Peter Sefton visited Cambridge
(PT is still here for the rest of the week). We were joined by a critical
mass of others - both IRL and virtually and made great progress. I am now
confident that we can offer the world "Scholarly HTML" (PT's phrase) as a
vibrant and significant aspect of scholarly communication. There are more
details in the blog post, but in essence:

   - ScHTML is web-democratic. Anyone anywhere can be involved. We develop
   our own rules and "conventions" as we proceed
   - The use of ScHTML has no fundamental limits - it is not restricted to
   "publishing" and could, for example, interpoerate very nicely with Wikipedia


I shall announce ScHTML tomorrow at the JISC conference in Liverpool as part
of their "Open Scholarship" session. I have 1 minute for that.

Anyone can be involved in ScHTML right now. If BtPDF has future meetings and
activities (and I hope it does) then ScHTML should be part of them.

Will it work?

That depends on YOU. Read the post.

[Currently we are using BtPDF as the mailing list - and possibly the Wiki.
We are using OKF Etherpads for collecting and refining our thoughts. We use
Bitbucket for the code/specs. Other ideas welcome]

This is incorrect. The http://opendefinition.org/okd/ states:

<quote>
The work shall be available as a whole and at no more than a
reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet
without charge. The work must also be available in a convenient and
modifiable form.
</quote>

Hence the 'bulk' ("as a whole") requirement is in the Open Definition.

There's no restriction regarding what you register on CKAN - in
particular there is no requirement to only register Open Definition
compliant datasets. That said, obviously we do highlight (in a variety
of ways) those datasets that are open and I don't think we want
datasets that will always remain closed, and especially those datasets
that are clearly 'paid-access-only'.

In the same vein, I have started a correspondence with Mendeley, which has not got far yet,
about access to their data through their API http://dev.mendeley.com/
According to  http://dev.mendeley.com/docs/license
"All data from the Mendeley API is made available under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License for commercial and non-commercial derivations."
Worth listing on CKAN  I think. But we dont yet have bulk access.
Anyone else been in touch with Mendeley on this issue?

One possibility would be for a number of agents to extract subsets of Mendeley data they cared about and to pool these 
subsets in an OKFN supported data store.
This is a general possibility, whenever a data provider provides an open API but is unwilling to support their own bulk store.
We can consider one store for multiple data sources,  much as Thomas Krichel provides at http://3lib.org/
Can we estimate the cost of OKFN maintaining such a store on various scales with various levels of service?

I think we can regard the Mendeley core data as completely OKD-compliant.
However they distribute abstracts and they CANNOT be assumed to be open. So
strip out the abstracts and all Mendely is OKD-Open. It's great news.

We need to have a crawler for their API. We have been crawling the
commercial publishers and should have potentially 10 million records.

My main caution about pooling bulk exports is the issue of updates.  
First, there is the need to have up-to-date bulk files on some kind of  
regular basis. This is sometimes burdensome for the data providers.  
Second, for consumers of the data it is often desirable to get  
incremental updates. If you have added the data to some system or  
function of your own you do not want to receive the entire file in  
order to add new or updated data.

I realize that many of the bulk files being produced today can be  
considered experimental in nature, but if we are to move into  
production mode for any of the data this update issue must be addressed.

OK. Please advise who is your Mendeley contact I can inform my Mendeley 
contacts of the parallel discussions. Glad to let you proceed on this one.

I proposed before a bulletin board or similar where the task of
approaching various data suppliers can be divided and conquered without
unnecessary duplication.  How can that most easily be facilitated?

For the record, I am currently talking also to Cornell and Duke UP about access 
to arXiv and Project Euclid metadata. arXiv is operationally at least CC BY and they may go to CC0 for the metadata without abstracts. Euclid is still under 
discussion.  I am also taling to IMS about their data, eventually to include CIS, and I am gradually taking up the licensing issues for various people data sets at http://people.bibkn.org

That is what IsItOpen is about. We still have to tackle the question of
summarising replies and presenting a readable account.

Hello,

Raymond B?rard has published an interesting article titled "Free
Library Data?" in LIBER QUARTERLY[1]. Unfortunately the working
group's activities aren't mentioned at all.

I already contacted Raymond B?rard and drew his attention to the
group. Hopefully he'll join the discussion...

All the best

Following up on a point from Peter's previous:

>> We have been crawling the commercial publishers and should have potentially 10 million records.

First a few questions for Peter, then some for the group:

For Peter:

Where/when will the results of this crawling be made available?
With what attributes/schema (especially, any subject classification?, citation data?) and what license?
What explicit permissions do you have from which publishers?
What if any basis for updating?
How will your crawl compare with http://www.journaltocs.hw.ac.uk/ ?

For the group:

Who else in the group besides Peter, myself(Jim) and Thomas is involved in medium to large scale 
efforts to aggregate article metadata?
How to avoid unnecessary duplication of such efforts?
How to ensure consistency and viability of a large open store of article metadata from multiple sources?
What organization can be trusted to openly maintain such a large database? Are we thinking OKFN. If not OKFN then what?
By what business model could the database be maintained?
How should authority to write to the database be managed? 

Excuse so many questions, but it seems timely to initiate some general discussion of these
issues.

When we have time to concentrate on how that is done

With what attributes/schema (especially, any subject classification?


that may be copyright so we don't save it


> , citation data?)


that requires fulltext which we don;t have access to

and what license?

 CC0 - the STM publishers agree that bib metadata are not copyright

What explicit permissions do you have from which publishers?

we don't need them

What if any basis for updating?

no idea but the software can be rerun any time

How will your crawl compare with http://www.journaltocs.hw.ac.uk/ ?

it will get the article metadata, not the tocs

Coordinate it here

lets' see what we get. We can't really tell till we analyze it

Article metadata is pretty static. The changes (such as withdrawn articles)
are generally not consistently managed by the publishers anyway.

By what business model could the database be maintained?

I don't think we can answer this now. When academia shows some interest in
actually doing anything it will be easy. The best we can do is build a
bottom-up demonstrator

What is happening is that various prototypes are being created by early
adopters. It's clear that some types of metadata are easy to collect at very
low cost. When we have got those we'll get some idea of quality - e.g. are
records from different sources compatible.  Then - I hope - we'll get some
interest fromn potential funders.

If academia relaises that it can take control of its own we may have some
traction. The quality of commercial bib data is not necessarily good by
definition - and I have some examples of awful stuff. But it's much easier
to spend millions of pounds of academic money than to ...

We shall get something useful but ...

The following from the University of Florida may be of interest to the group:

?Beginning March 2011, the University of Florida Smathers
?Libraries implemented a policy to include a Creative Commons
?license in all of its original cataloging records. The records
?are considered public domain with unrestricted downstream use for
?any purpose.

?The following MARC 588 field (Source of Description Note) is
?added to new records contributed to WorldCat. It has not been
?added retrospectively to University of Florida original records
?in WorldCat.

? ?588::|a This bibliographic record is available under a
? ?Creative Commons CC0 license. The University of Florida
? ?Libraries, as creator of this bibliographic record, has
? ?waived all rights to it worldwide under copyright law,
? ?including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent
? ?allowed by law.

?The University of Florida OPAC (a Solr/Lucene search engine) is
?configured to display a Creative Commons CC0 license statement
?based on the presence of a University of Florida OCLC symbol in
?the MARC 040 field |a. The specified 040 |a is mapped to the
?originalcataloger_text field in the Solr/Lucene record if it
?exists in incoming records. ?This allows the statement to be

Thanks very much for this Tim! Great news.

Adrian, Mark: shall we put an item about this on openbiblio.net? We
could tag things like this 'data releases' or something. This would
also be *very* useful to have as an archive.

Hello,

I don't know whether this really is a "data release". What is licensed
are individual records and no full data dumps. As far as I know
Florida University library didn't provide an export of records with a
waiver (yet).

As in the past it always were catalog dumps that were licensed, this
is the first case that an open license is attached to individual
records. I think that a Public Domain Mark[1] would be more
appropriate for this use case as everything speaks for individual
bibliographic records being public domain, at least if they don't
contain abstracts. By attaching a waiver to data originally created by
Florida university library staff they implicitely state that you CAN
claim copyright on individual records.

I would like to know what is the goal of this initiative. Does anybody
on this list know more about its background? Openly licensing
individual records doesn't prevend OCLC or any other agent from
aggregating records into another catalog and copyrighting this
collection. The legal status of the whole simply doesn't derive from
the status of its parts. Thus, legally, you can claim intellectual
copyright on a collection of openly licensed material. OCLC themselves
has made clear they aren't claiming intellectual property rights on
single records.[2]

I think, it's the licensing of collections of data, of whole catalogs
that really matters. Convention shows that single records were and are
always treated as if they were public domain so we don't have to fight
for this anymore. The Principles on Open Bibliographic Data[3] take
this into account as they explicitely refer to collections. It would
be great if the University of Florida library would publish a dump of
all public domain records under CC0.

Thanks Adrian. Are you in touch with them? Or is anyone else on the
list in touch with them about licensing?

Tim: have you been talking to them directly?

All the best,

Jonathan

This comes out of the OCLC record re-use policy, and Florida is  
essentially exercising the same initiative as U Michigan did. The OCLC  
policy says that OCLC makes no claim over records that the library  
itself created, and therefore the library, if it can identify those  
records, can do whatever it wants with them without any of the  
limitations in the policy. So this action has to do with the OCLC  
policy, which does not allow re-use of other records from their  
database.

The fact that they have added a license to each record should probably  
not be read as any assumption about copyright and bibliographic data.  
They are trying to make their records that are not limited by the OCLC  
policy available. This is a Good Thing. To do so, they needed to 1)  
identify those records and 2) let others downstream identify those  
records. They've done so with a note field carrying the CC license.

They didn't provide an export because they didn't think it would be  
useful. Some of us have suggested it to them. The export would most  
likely be in MARC format. Should we continue to press them on this?

I definitely think we should encourage all agents releasing data to provide
a dump. This allows others to opportunistically upgrade the data format and
cross link it to other sources.  The value of individual releases may be limited,
but collectively the value should grow.

When you suggest a dump to libraries their first thought is: how will  
we keep it up to date? I think this is a legitimate concern. Any data  
set produced more than one month ago is probably quite out of date  
already. In most library systems, creating a large dump is quite  
awkward since the systems are in constant use and a dump consumes  
considerable resources.

I think we should ask for dumps, but we either have to be concerned  
about keeping them up to date or we should expressly treat these as  
"experimental" and thus relieve the providing agency of the burden of  
reproducing dumps on a regular basis. (And I'm not convinced that a  
succession of full dumps truly serves the needs of folks building  
databases.)

  Hi,

  I have done some updating on the 3lib web site at http://3lib.org,
  to bring it closer in line to what we use in AuthorClaim. 
  I included SOLIS, Euclid, Agris. Comments and suggestions
  are most welcome! 

  In other news, James Robert Griffin III will talk about 3lib,
  AuthorClaim, and more importantly, how they are used together in the
  budding AuthorProfile service, at the upcoming ORCID partipants

Understood.  Would it be too much to ask libraries to plug their catalogs into OAI-PMH?

Sadly probably yes, given the closed nature of commercial library 
management systems and relative lack of development in this area.

I've grafted OAI-PMH functionality onto a library catalogue / LMS in a 
former job and attempted to get a commercial vendors solution up and 
running in my present one. Whilst both worked to a point, neither was 
exactly straightforward. The former required a lot of hacking.

An additional complication would be licensing restrictions around record 
ownership. Any OAI-PMH repository 'on the side' would arguably have to 
handle exclusively open data, which means passing it selected metadata 
from the LMS. Many libraries are still unsure of the IPR history of much 
of their data. With COMET, we are hoping to provide some clarity here at 
least.

To throw this back, it seems clear to me that complete dumps are of most 
interest to consumers of open data, above and beyond feeds/API's (which 
are marginally more achievable for libraries). How useful is it for 
those in the business of consuming open data to have regular updates and 
or some form of version control over data dumps and at what frequency? 
Would you satisfied with a 'one-off', which is much more achievable?

In general, yes, unfortunately it is too much to ask. UF is a  
particularly sophisticated library system, so they may have the  
capability, but OAI is generally not available from commercial library  
systems, which is what most libraries use. The only way I know to make  
the library system data available is to export it and load it into an  
OAI-PMH-compatible repository. UF may be able to do this, but again  
there is the export/update question since OAI-PMH does not go directly  
against their working database.

Subject: [open-bibliography] 'Opening Data-Opening Doors' Conference moves
	to a bigger venue - more places available
Message-ID: <D8483099-551B-4982-BAA1-2EEDF9418C6F@ostephens.com>

Due to demand, this conference has now moved to a larger venue and more tickets have now been released ... so if you missed out the first time, why not sign up now :)

How can we gain bigger audiences for our scholarly and cultural resources and enhance services for researchers, teachers and learners? 

The 'Opening Data - Opening Doors' event on Monday 18th April marks the starting point of a new programme of activity led by the JISC and RLUK Resource Discovery Taskforce to help answer this question.  The RDTF programme, involving national stakeholders across the spectrum of Libraries, Archives and Museums, is focused on building critical mass through opening up data, exploring and demonstrating what open data makes possible, and actively sharing learning points with the wider community.

Chaired by Professor David Baker, Deputy Chair of the JISC Board, on behalf of the JISC and RLUK Resource Discovery Task Force, the 'Opening Data - Opening Doors' event will:

*         Hear from services that are opening up their data including what's happening in the new RDTF projects that have just been commissioned

*         Help to shape the messages, advice and support offered during the 2011 programme and beyond

*         Help to develop practical and engaging approaches to exploiting our data

Confirmed speakers are from King's College London, National Maritime Museum, RLUK, The National Archives, UKOLN and University of Cambridge.

Due to demand for extra tickets, we have moved the conference location, still in central Manchester close to Piccadilly station.

New Venue: Mint Hotel Manchester, 1 Auburn Street, 1 Piccadilly Place, Manchester, M1 3DG 

Date: Monday 18th April 2011, 10.00am to 4.00pm

Who should attend? Managers, practitioners, developers and advocates from libraries, archives, museums, associated publishers and interested organisations who want early involvement in clarifying, expanding and challenging the realities of exposing, sharing and exploiting the resource description data held by our institutions.

Subject: [open-bibliography] concrete things and works
Message-ID: <20110325160900.GA55581@styx.org>

Just to elaborate a bit on something that came up in
the call today. Keeping in mind some thoughts
expressed on the LLD list last week [1] which are 
salient.

Tatiana wants a way to link together different books
into some thing like a "Work", expressing the difference
between myriad editions of "War and Peace" and the
platonic ideal of the work "War and Peace".

I think it is too early to do this. We still don't
have all the plumbing that we need in order to manage
individual items, we have yet to import more varied
datasets, basic things like user account management,
creating and editing entries really do need to be
done first.

Talking about things on a more abstract level is 
hard. Put vaguely, we all might agree that there is
such a thing as a Work, but looking closer it isn't
at all clear that we are agreeing on the same thing.
Librarians have a well developed set of cataloging
rules that tell them when something is a new work
and when it is not. These rules may or may not map
cleanly to the way an art historian or musicologist
thinks of such things. When do we have a derived 
work? The intellectual property lawyers probably have
yet different ideas. If we have translations are these
new, derived works? Librarians might say no, lawyers
would likely say yes.

So this is where things get interesting. How do we
erect a conceptual superstructure on top of these 
concrete things that we have? Can we allow for 
alternative conceptual superstructures? Particularly
how does this affect searching and browsing (and 
here is the relevance of FRBR understood as functional
requirements not as a set of classes and rules)?

Our interest in the public domain necessarily means
that we cannot take a strictly library science point
of view since we seek to provide answers to what are
fundamentally legal questions. But we don't want to
make something that would be unrecognisable to a 
librarian.

So we should think about these things, but definitely
not rush forward with implementation especially as
there are many much simpler things, proverbial low-
hanging fruit, that need doing.

Cheers,
-w
