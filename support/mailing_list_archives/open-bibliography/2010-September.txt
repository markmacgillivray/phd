This all sounds right to me in principle.
I cannot judge whether the RDF implementation is best possible, but 
something way like this seems like the way to go. My main concern is that
the conceptualization be simple enough that there is not too high an entry barrier
to provision of data in the desired format.
I'd like to hear more about your meshing tool. I've made several 
naive starts at this problem in simple cases, especially in aggregating personal
bibliographies (deduplicating bibitems) and in deduplicating lists of authors.
A simple tool and adequate data framework and UI for these tasks would be most welcome.

Doesn't a lot of this depend on how you define "same"? This is rather  
complex today due to the replication of resources in various formats.  
Is it the same if one citation is to the print copy of the article,  
and another cites a postprint in a repository? (The latter may have  
different formatting or different pagination depending on how it was  
produced.) Is it that the texts are the same, or that the actual  
publication is the same? (Which would mean that the article in the  
journal and the postprint are considered different resources.) Do you  
intend to distinguish between preprints and published articles? Would  
you consider a piece of music on CD and its online copy to be the  
same, even though the compression is different? As you can see, the  
questions go on and on!

There's also the question of confidence: what degree of confidence do  
you need before declaring "same"? Do you prefer to err on the side of  
over-bundling or under-bundling? This interacts with your definition  
of sameness -- for example, let's say you decide that if you have two  
texts with the same author, same title, and same year, they are the  
same. You won't check for format, length, etc. That would probably  
bring together pre-prints, post-prints, and possibly even different  
versions of the same text. So in that way you have defined "same"  
rather broadly. Or you could decide that two texts are the same only  
if they both cite precisely the same publication with the same  
pagination and full date. That is a different definition of same, with  
more confidence.

Hopefully, once you determine what you mean by "same" then you can  
determine what you want to apply OWL sameAs to.

As you can tell, I have agonized over this one for many a long hour. :-)

  Deduplication is also service context dependent. As an example, for
  AuthorClaim, I ignore PubMed Central records, since I assume---I
  have not looked at this in as much detail as I should---that all
  PubMed Central records are in PubMed, which I fully cover. I can do
  this because full-text article retrieval is of no concern in an
  author claiming service. If I were to run a full-text retrieval
  service, I would be very foolish to do that.

Yes. The meaning of owl:sameAs is well defined. It means,

    If x owl:sameAs y, then the following are true:
        * for every p,o such that the triple (x,p,o) exists, the
           triple (y,p,o) is implied
        * for every s,o such that the triple (s,x,o) exists, the
           triple (s,y,o) is implied
        * for every s,p such that the triple (s,p,x) exists, the
           triple (s,p,y) is implied

As you point out, having a weaker sameAs degenerates
into "similar to", actually, "similar to in the relevant respects".
Evaluating relevance means taking into account the *intent*
of someone using the information, the *context* of any
query that might eventually be made over the data. If
anyone can come up with a tractable theory of similarity
and relevance that holds generally they deserve at least a
Nobel prise.

Ben agreed in a private mail to me (that may have been
intended for the list, there wasn't anything particularly
private in it) that owl:sameAs is probably too strong a
predicate for what he would like to accomplish.

Even if you define a weaker version of sameAs for the
intended use cases, call it similarTo, you still have to
figure out how to arrange the data so that interesting
properties, e.g. names and titles, get put in the right
place so that you can make unambiguous queries that
don't return duplicates. For example you might move
all name variants up to a PersonBundle and your
queries would always involve that and not individual
Person resources.

So what is needed to make this workable is a class,
subclass of Bundle, for each type of thing that can be
deduplicated and a generic similarTo predicate that
points to the original resource, together with rules
specific to that type of thing that say which properties
get copied. (Alternatively, a generic Bundle and a
number of thing-specific similarTo variants, and a
corresponding set of rules).

Cheers,
-w

Sorry for the direct reply to Will, it wasn't secret - I hadn't checked
the address once I hit 'Reply-to' :)

Essentially, I said that I felt that the notion of 'sameas' worked fine
when 'merging' or connecting the ideals (or their subsequent bundles).

The reason I used the word Ideal is that it was meant as a mythical,
perfect metadata record from which all other record representations
might be derived. The desired implication is that all manifestations,
all records are incomplete representations of this data.

This is not to say that an aggregation of triples from all the sources
would get us closer to an Ideal - far from it. Any representation has a
bias, whether personal, conventional or otherwise. For example, the same
record might have representations in MARC, RIS, or any number of RDF
modelled versions - it could use a DC/PRISM model or FRBR/RDA in RDF or
some other varient, heavy in literals or heavy in URIs.

In response to Karen's point about the definition of 'same', it is down
to the context and an acknowledgement that you can't please all of the
people, all of the time. I think the phrase "same, for the intents and
purposes of ...." helps point out what I am intending. 

There is nothing wrong with duplication. We deduplicate to make certain
tasks much easier and it is those tasks that define the 'sameness' that
we should aim for. 

This is why the technique of ideals and closures I described doesn't
affect or alter the source data and why nothing irreversible happens
without a very, very good reason. I am going to pair things up
erroneously, and I am not going to be able to deduplicate whole datasets
before they are used. I can attempt to make unpicking and merging on the
fly as painless as possible and account for the fact that records may
change after the fact which this is my attempt to do.

The ideal records won't have any real metadata on them, save for admin
triples - they will point to aggregations or format variations of what
is my 'best guess' version of a record at the current time.

I absolutely agree and I'll also say that when you are de-duplicating
for any of these reasons, you will be using some probabilistic method of
some kind, 99% of the time ;) Whether it's a fellegi-sunter based whole
record dedupe, or single field (eg id) matching, there will be false
positives and false negatives. 

Your success rate will always be <100%, and the degree of success will
vary depending on who and for what purpose this was done.

I've been aiming to tackle this in a map-reduce style - once set of
processes flag similarities and the other set 'reduce' and create the
bundle-closure structure. This works in practice and so far, not a
concern to me.

I've just written up a description of what happens at the 'reduce' stage
- what actually happens when things are found to be similar/'same'.

The map stage is the one I am heavily working on. I, too, initially
tried some naive approaches, initially attempting a weighted similarity
using levenshtein distances, hoping to hit the 80:20 sweet spot, but I
was getting nowhere near decent levels of hits. 

I started to try other string similarity metrics, including one that
split the fields into tokens before before similarity matching and
balancing for omissions/additions. 

The short story is that this whole area is not a new one, and I stopped
trying to re-invent wheels and just accept that there is a reason why
people use the more complex methods.

(Good run down of string similarity metrics here:
http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~sam/stringmetrics.html
)

So, I am currently adapting a library called Febrl for this purpose -
(Freely extensible biomedical record linkage) - which uses a combination
of these string similarity metrics in a Fellegi-Sunter approach to
dedupe.

PS there is a useful paper surveying effectiveness of various string
similarity techniques here:

I sent an email to BL and asked them to provide the bibliographic data
under a free license as well (i.e. to get rid of the -nc restriction).

In other news, the university libraries of T?bingen and Konstanz have
recently released their data under cc-by-nc-sa and we had a fruitful
exchange on changing the license to cc-by-sa or cc0. I am expecting
the change any time soon.

  That's Marshall's site, the BL link is

  Unfortunately, it does not contain the ETOC contents,
  which is the one that's important for academic
  librarianship.

Hi. I've got a couple of points on this subject with two different "Hats"

/Chris-the-eprints-guy: /
EPrints 3.2.1 onwards provides some basic linked data, but the relevant 
thing is it also produces good URIs suitable for linking via a 
de-dupping service. It mints URIs for its metadata records, its 
documents, the files in its documents (OK, those are just URLs of 
files), which you would expect.

It also makes URIs for people, conferences, conference locations, 
publications and organisations. This is done by hashing known data about 
them and a few assumptions.

Example of our URIs can be seen here, a conference paper.
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/export/eprint/21498/RDFN3/ecs-eprint-21498.n3?mimetype=text/plain

My hope is that this will be a good starting point for dedupping 
services. We are open to suggestions from people who want to actively 
use our data, and not that open to people who want us to do it "right" 
based on their set of beliefs.

/Chris-the-RDF-guy:
/It's OK to say to similar things are the same, if they are the same for 
the purposes of your dataset. A dataset about movie scripts would 
consider the Adam West Batman very different from the Batman Begins 
Batman. However a dataset mapping what comic book characters appear in 
movies would probably treat both as the same, and declare their #batman 
to be the same as all the comic book incarnations and all the movie 
incarnations. They are all the sameAs your concept of batman FOR YOUR 
PURPOSES.

sameAs is a subjective term. Honouring it semantically should be based 
on the source of the assertion. Sources should aim to be clear and 
consistent in how they sameAs things.

Just accept that sameAs is going to drift its meaning as we now have a 
tide of non-logic-obsessed people building RDF, who don't give a durn 
for your OWL.

Yes, this looks terrific. From http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html
I see 

Files are distributed under a 
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License. 
http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/

This seems to me a reasonable choice for biblio metadata, and one there is
some hope of getting big non-profit data providers to use.
I dont see any significant downside to the "NonCommercial" feature, and
"ShareAlike" seems OK too. 

However, the "Users are required to register for the service and agree ..."
is a bit strange, and does not seem consistent with the license.  Are re-users
of the data required also to register with BNL?
It would be interesting to see a copy of the registration agreement.
How about OKFN registering as a user and hosting a copy with easier access? 
Or Thomas, how about hosting on 3lib?

hmm, when opening up our bibliographic data with hbz, we discussed possible
metadata licenses quite a lot. Rather quick it was apparent, that
except CC0 all CC-licenses had its problems - CC-A-NC-SA being the
worst of all.

Attribution means: When querying and combining thousands of
SPARQL-Endpoints to finally get *one* result item, then you have to
stick thousand attribution notices to the item, when showing it to the
end user. Not very practical...

Non commercial means: Wikipedia, Google and so on can't use it -
meaning less use and visibility

Share-alike means: The result of combinations of CC-*-SA and CC0 get
"poisoned" by SA, because parts that once were CC0 are now bound to
CC-*-SA.

Nevertheless the step of releasing the data is good news. But it would
be even better with a different type of license... Perhaps they'll
reconsider their choice at some point and change the license...

As a company I obviously dislike NC. But more generally I would think
it raises all sorts of problems for libraries to get NC MARC records.
Most libraries don't do all their own work, but take part in all sorts
of data improvement, data transfer and data processing relationships,
with vendors in all sorts of relationships. At the most basic level,
libraries exchange records, and there's no reliable way of coding the
legal status of diffs into MARC records. All told, it's unclear to me
what NC would bind, and what it wouldn't, what it would prevent for
real, and what it would prevent because the situation is just too
foggy.

Another question is simple: Is OCLC "non-commercial" or not? I say
"not on your life, they're a monstrous and extortionary data
monopoly." But I'm sure they'd say they were. What is the CC answer?

I meant to respond straight away but things move fast on this list :)
You are quite right that this data isn't yet open. However I'm
optimistic some real open data is on the way.

As people know from Peter Murray Rust's announcement to this list, the
JISC OpenBib project [1] (in which I am participating) is making
aiming to make available a reasonable set of *open* bibliographic data
in linked open data form.

[1]: http://openbiblio.net/p/jiscopenbib/

As part of the project we had commitments from 3 specific sources
(we're looking for more!) to provide some "raw" *open* bibliographic
data:

a) Cambridge University Library
b) the British Library
c) International Union of Crystallography

In the last 2 months JISC OpenBib have been talking in detail with
British Library and we're hoping to get an initial set of data from
them quite soon. I don't know whether these discussions (and the
original discussion of the project with them -- which took place in
the Spring) has prompted this free data service but there should
definitely be a set of real open data coming from them in the near
future (though I should emphasize that, at this point at least, it
certainly won't be their whole catalogue in MARC form!)

This is really great news. BTW if they are thinking of share-alike
they really want the ODbL (http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/)
rather than CC by-sa.

Hello,
 
sorry for being so late for this. Hopefully some of you have the time to attend anyway: Our next regular virtual meeting will be tomorrow at 16:00 UK time (BST). I started an Etherpad at http://okfnpad.org/3rd-open-bibliography-meeting. I haven't added that much topics to the agenda yet. Everybody feel free to edit.

All the best
Adrian

Subject: [open-bibliography] New sample of BL data available
Message-ID: <19BB7EB59CBC594D8DD9F3ACA1EB24A201538BB7@w2k3-bspex2.ad.bl.uk>

All, 

 

A couple of weeks ago, the BL announced that it would make some of its
datasets available free of charge. The first sample file provided a
basic RDF/DC representation of our BNB data. We've now produced a more
granular representation. A sample is available at:

http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datasamples.html

 

This is work in progress and feedback on the data structure is very
welcome (on this list or direct to me, whatever is best). 

 

Thanks,

 

Corine

Message-ID: <4C86A5B7.2040807@okfn.org>

W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group -
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/

Call for Use Cases: Library Linked Data

Are you currently using linked data technology [1] for library-related
data, or considering doing it in the near future? If so, please tell us
more by filling in the questionnaire below and sending it back to us or
to public-lld at w3.org, preferably before October 15th, 2010.

The information you provide will be influential in guiding the
activities the Library Linked Data Incubator Group will undertake to
help increase global interoperability of library data on the Web. The
information you provide will be curated and published on the group
wikispace at [3].

We understand that your time is precious, so please don't feel you have
to answer every question. Some sections of the templates are clearly
marked as optional. However, the more information you can provide, the
easier it will be for the Incubator Group to understand your case. And,
of course, please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any trouble
answering our questions. Editorial guidance on specific points is
provided at [2], and examples are available at [3].

We are particularly interested in use cases describing the use of
library linked data for end-user oriented applications. However, we're
not ruling anything out at this stage, and the Incubator Group will
carefully consider all submissions we receive.

On behalf of the Incubator Group, thanks in advance for your time,

Emmanuelle Bermes (Emmanuelle.Bermes_bnf.fr),
Alexander Haffner (A.Haffner_d-nb.de),

================================================================
================================================================

=== Name ===

A short name by which we can refer to the use case in discussions.

=== Owner ===

The contact person for this use case.

=== Background and Current Practice ===

Where this use case takes place in a specific domain, and so requires
some prior information to understand, this section is used to describe
that domain. As far as possible, please put explanation of the domain in
here, to keep the scenario as short as possible. If this scenario is
best illustrated by showing how applying technology could replace
current existing practice, then this section can be used to describe the
current practice. Often, the key to why a use case is important
also lies in what problem would occur if it was not achieved, or what
problem means it is hard to achieve.

=== Goal ===

Two short statements stating (1) what is achieved in the scenario
without reference to linked data, and (2) how we use linked data
technology to achieve this goal.

=== Target Audience ===

The main audience of your case. For example scholars, the general
public, service providers, archivists, computer programs...

=== Use Case Scenario ===

The use case scenario itself, described as a story in which actors
interact with systems. This section should focus on the user needs in
this scenario. Do not mention technical aspects and/or the use of linked
data.

=== Application of linked data for the given use case ===

This section describes how linked data technology could be used to
support the use case above. Try to focus on linked data on an abstract
level, without mentioning concrete applications and/or vocabularies.
Hint: Nothing library domain specific.

=== Existing Work (optional) ===

This section is used to refer to existing technologies or approaches
which achieve the use case (Hint: Specific approaches in the library
domain). It may especially refer to running prototypes or applications.

=== Related Vocabularies (optional) ===

Here you can list and clarify the use of vocabularies (element sets and
value vocabularies) which can be helpful and applied within this context.

=== Problems and Limitations (optional) ===

This section lists reasons why this scenario is or may be difficult to
achieve, including pre-requisites which may not be met, technological
obstacles etc. Please explicitly list here the technical challenges made
apparent by this use case. This will aid in creating a roadmap to
overcome those challenges.

=== Related Use Cases and Unanticipated Uses (optional) ===

The scenario above describes a particular case of using linked data.
However, by allowing this scenario to take place, the likely solution
allows for other use cases. This section captures unanticipated uses of
the same system apparent in the use case scenario.

=== References (optional) ===

This section is used to refer to cited literature and quoted websites.

  (1) The application contributes to the identification of authors
  (and editors, and potentially other contributors, but let's stick
  to the term author for simplicity.)

  Academic authors, who publish research papers.

  Registrants contact the service to fill in simple personal data such
  as name and affiliation. They build a set of name variations.  The
  service searches for the name of the person in a database of close
  to 100,000,000 authorships. It proposes registrants that the item is
  theirs or not. The result is a profile of documents that the person
  has authored and not authored. The search is repeated periodically
  to search for new additions to the document dataset.

  Linked data could be used to export the profiles, with bibliogrphic
  information as usend in AuthorClaim *as well as* the original 
  bibligraphic record.

  A piece related work in the library domain are name authority
  files. Such files are usually maintained by a third person. In
  AuthorClaim, the author maintains the profile.

  There is no good free source for metadata about academic articles.
  One can compile a dataset from sources, but then there is the issue
  of duplication. 

  The main challenge for the system at this time it to build applications
  that will use the profiles.

  http://authorclaim.org is the main site.
  ftp://authorclaim.org has the profiles for download
  http://ariw.org is the contributor of institutional affiliations data.
  http://3lib.org has information about some of the dataset used in AuthorClaim
  http://acis.openlib.org has information about the software used
  http://authors.repec.org has a very similar system using document
  data from the RePEc digital library.

Are the free of charge datasets usable by the co-op?

I thought I read they were for non-commercial users only and these
samples only seem to say they're "for research purposes" so I'm not
sure if they are safe for co-operative workers to touch.

Why didn't BL just use CC0 like some others recently?  It would avoid
this mess.

Ray,

You're correct, the datasets are for non-commercial users for research
purposes only.

If you are uncertain about whether you qualify for these, please contact
metadata at bl.uk to discuss your requirements.

What I am particularly interested in is feedback on the metadata, the
RDF/DC XML, etc.

Thanks

Corine

The current BL licensing model contains a -nc clause that restricts
usage to non-commercial application. The license does not contain a
clause to restrict usage to research purposes only and it does not
contain any kind of information whether commercial research is allowed
or forbidden.

However, the -nc clause and an (additional) "research purposes only"
clause render the data non-free by all defintions.


Yours,
Mathias

I guess the inherent question is: Why should anybody put a lot of/any
effort into the datasets - eg. augment its usefulness with the
combination of other *free* datasets - considering its limited further
use/audience - eg. no Wikipedia et al?

At least, thats what comes to my mind - even if we would qualify for
your license terms as a university library ;-)

Yes, that's exactly right.  For example, the co-op does donate time,
effort and money to community projects, but this sort of
anti-commercial action by the British Library contradicts our
principles of autonomy and widening economic participation, so we
shouldn't support it.

Why isn't a national organisation like bl.uk supporting the new
ukgov Big Society and mutualisation agendas?  The government is
the BL's main source of income, after all, so it's disappointing

Subject: [open-bibliography] [ANN] OFS - a python bitstream storage API w/
 S3/pairtree/archive.org backends
Message-ID: <1284041194.1852.29.camel@monster>

http://openbiblio.net/2010/09/09/introducing-ofs-a-python-bucketobject-storage-library/

Many of the members of this list likely share the same problem of
storing bitstreams in an object- or uri-orientated manner so forgive me
for posting about this general API for storage here.

Blog post text follows:

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Many internally distributed storage systems ? such as Amazon?s S3
service or Riak?s key-value architecture ?  have similarities in the
manner in which data is labelled and subsequently retrieved. This is
often because the systems themselves use a distributed hash table or a
similar distribution algorithm to disperse and then later find the data
they store.

OFS is a python library that seeks to capitalise on their similarities ?
providing a single, general API to put and get files from one of these
services while hiding the specifics of the implementation from the user.
This allows for local testing and development before transitioning to
using one of the cloud services, services which typically cost real
money and slows down testing due to the necessity of communicating with
these services over an internet connection.

Characteristics of OFS:

      * Uses a ?bucket/label? mechanism to identify individual files
      * Provides a list of content in a given bucket (as best as that
        the service can provide)
      * Provides per-file metadata in so far as the service can provide
        (key-value or JSON encode-able data)
      * Current backend plugins:
              * Local storage ? based on the pairtree specification that
                optimises file-distribution across a native file-system
                to handle large quantities of files. Uses JSON to encode
                arbitrary metadata about the files in a given bucket.
              * Remote storage (S3 and Archive plugins written
                by Friedrich Lindenberg (pudo) who has also made large
                contributions to the codebase):
                      * Amazon S3
                      * Archive.org
                      * Riak (in progress)
              * Also in progress ? a REST Client by Friedrich Lindenberg
                (pudo)
              * One key desire is to provide opaque sharding ? breaking
                up very large files to spread across buckets or even
                systems to improve performance and the range of services
                or backend systems OFS can make use of.

It is plain that having the ability to write storage code in a common
way, but make use of local as well as remote ?cloud? storage is of a
great benefit. It encourages file storage to be codified in a
distribute-able manner so that scaling later on is easier.

This is a work in progress, but the local implementation is intended to
be both a reference implementation as well as useful testing or even
production backend for storage. Other backends potentially will have
less comprehensive metadata support for individual files, but these
?limits? will be included as optional warnings or exceptions once we
have a handle on what they are.

Please comment or give feedback on this library. Also, we would welcome
any patches for other backend support to the library!

Apologies if this development from the British Library has already been mentioned:

"The British Library is to make its extensive collections of bibliographic records available for free to researchers and other libraries: www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html

As part of its work to open its metadata to wider use beyond the traditional library community, the British Library is making copies of its main catalogue and British National Bibliography datasets available for research purposes. Files are initially being made available in XML and structured in an RDF/DC format (see samples). Files are distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.

The British Library is currently investigating options for structuring its catalogue information as linked data and is collaborating with a number of organisations in examining the issues associated with making bibliographic metadata available in this way.

Please contact metadata at bl.uk for further information."

Message-ID: <AANLkTim4bDXEJWBHLGTg5AFv5XWYNdF=hnGGvCVc2mbz@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I know there has already been discussion on the list about open
bibliographic from the British Library.

As people are aware the data currently on their website is not open.
However, as I said previously the JISC OpenBib project (of which I,
Peter Murray-Rust and Ben O'Steen are a part) have been in discussion
with them for several months about getting a large set of data that
will be fully open.

I just met again with the BL earlier this week and, fingers crossed,
this data should be becoming available in the next few weeks.

In the mean time, if people have queries for the BL I suggest
directing them through myself or Peter Murray-Rust as we are already
in dialogue with them.

Regards,

Rufus

That data would be much more useful if it were open ;) See the terms

Hi everyone

Not sure if this is a repeat of anything already discussed, but I had a chat with the Open Rights Group's new open data campaigner this week, and in addition to open biblio data, the birth marriage and (importantly) death records at the Free BMD database might be of some benefit:

<http://www.freebmd.org.uk/>

As I understand it, there some additional work being done at the moment to make the BMD records held by UK government, more public, more accurate. and more accessible.

Just a thought.  If you think there's some area of open government data that ORG should be working on, I'm sure Javi would appreciate any help.

Hi there

Jordan explained that for copyright calculator you need authors to have died over 70 years ago, and the FreeBMD has that information, as their gaps are in the more recent records. It could be very useful.

I am afraid that opening up the reuse of BMD will be part of the campaign we are starting. From the little I know so far the licensing they have to transcribe and publish is a bit ad-hoc. 

The General Registrar Office has its own project to digitise BMD indexes, which is on hold pending the spending review, but I haven't found anything about reuse. It seems that these records are outside the PSI re-use regulations.

If you or anyone has any further info on genealogical data I really would appreciate it, as in our Open Data campaign we will be working closely with FreeBMD, so this will be a priority.

They just appointed their first paid staffer as well, so things should get moving around this dataset.

Lets meet soon.

Best, Javi

I don't know if it's the reason behind FreeBMD's licensing, but
historically the genealogical community has been gun shy of commercial
ventures due to past bad experiences snarfing up freely provided data
and then putting it behind pay walls and selling it back to the people
that provided it.  That, and the sleazy business practices of
companies like Ancestry have probably left a bad taste in people's
mouths about commercial usage.  I think the objections can be overcome
if the arguments are framed correctly, but it'll take some work.

Thanks for the update on the background here Tom.

Makes me think a share-alike license might be useful to address these
sort of 'enclosure' concerns -- and sharealike would be open (as
opposed to non-commercial restrictions).

The freebmd faq says:

The ONS granted the right to place the database on the Internet on the
condition that access to it be free of charge. Any commercialisation of
the database would require the ONS' prior and very improbable
authorisation.

(http://www.freebmd.org.uk/FAQ.html#9).

Public bodies have been so reluctant to allow general access to
genealogical documents in the past - mainly on the grounds that general
free availability would remove the revenue they need to preserve old
documents - that where they do allow limited transcription by
volunteers, those volunteers will generally self-police and block
attempts to consolidate the data in any public place. This applies more
to parish registers than the BMDs (but note that freedmb is only a free
index to the records, and does not have a copy of the records
themselves). For parish registers and censuses there are freereg.org.uk
and freecen.org.uk, but there is actually far more transcribed material
deliberately buried away in member-only yahoo groups etc, representing
(literally) many person-years of skilled volunteer transcription work.
Like Tom suggests, tread carefully or you may alienate the very people
who should be natural okf supporters.

Subject: [open-bibliography] 'Art Meets Astrophysics': Galaxy Zoo and
 Citizen Science - does this extend to Bibliography?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi==eBKY4A1tog9zyL=F-OEJ37QyZU5JnVGSpff8@mail.gmail.com>

At the risk of too much cross-posting, here is an example of citizen
cataloguing

Some of us in #jiscopenbib have floated the idea with JISC and others of
citizien bibliographer and bibliography camps. If art can be catalogued in
this way then so can books, journals etc.

P.


---------- Forwarded message ------



While the immediate context is a specific project in the cataloguing of oil
paintings, the model of public engagement and research which this project
brings to bear on its task has much wider implications for research across
the Arts & Humanities, and across Colleges. Specifically, it is relevant to
a number of themes and ambitions which we have already identified through
the Arts Lab research mapping project, and it can be applied to most of the
emerging themes highlighted by the AHRC.



Galaxy Zoo is the most high profile and developed example of the methodology
of Citizen Science and there is much to learn from it and from its
application in the ?Your Paintings? project. Information on Galaxy Zoo can
be found at http://www.galaxyzoo.org/

For further information on the philosophy and methodology of ?citizen
science? and the Citizen Science Alliance, however, please check out
http://citizensciencealliance.org/philosophy.html.



In this context, I hope the ?Art meets Astrophysics? seminar will be of
interest to you.

You are cordially invited to attend the first seminar of the new Arts Lab &
HATII Seminar Series: *"New Directions in Digital Humanities"*:



*(1) ART MEETS ASTROPHYSICS*
*Applying the Galaxy Zoo model of public engagement to the cataloguing of
the nation?s oil paintings*



*7 October 2010 5.15pm*

Main Lecture Theatre - Sir Alexander Stone Building
16 University Gardens, Glasgow


The Public Catalogue Foundation has been collecting information on the
200,000 oil paintings in public ownership in the UK. Before the Your
Paintings database is put online to the public by the BBC it needs to be
made fully searchable by tagging with concepts such as subject, style and
date.

The enormous task of (reliably and accurately) describing the pictorial
content of 200,000 paintings requires a revolutionary new approach ... that
developed by Galaxy Zoo to analyse the structures of galaxies. Galaxy Zoo 2,
for example, attracted 250,000 amateur participants who made 60 million
classifications of 250,000 galaxies in 14 months, which, with the
application of clever statistical algorithms, produced results as accurate
as professional astronomers would have achieved.

    ... Authors should be aware that their submitted manuscript,

    ... It is strongly encouraged, that the described tools or

And authors are of course free to make their papers, tools, etc.,
available elsewhere, indeed encouraged to do so. 

But you are correct, the journal itself is a print publication
and we don't have proper public metadata for it. I actually 
contacted the editors about this some time ago and they are 
planning to make bibliographic metadata available (in RDF) as
I understand it. It's just a question of time and resources.

I hardly think they're evil. They encourage openness but don't
necessarily enforce it. Do you have any suggestions about 
alternative journals that might be "more open" for this type of
material?

Any range you are particularly interested in?

Excellent. I look forward to this.
What I would like is to be able to easily filter out a dump of books by
broad subject
domain, e.g. mathematics or statistics, and then be able to do some serious
processing of those
locally. This should be easier to provide than a full API, right? Who to
contact to lobby for
priority for such use cases?

Great thanks to all those who contributed to this effort.

"Hyphen is always used for separating the prefix and the NBN string.
Colon is used as the delimiting character if and only if a country
code-based NBN namespace is split further in smaller sub-namespaces.
If there are several national libraries in one country, these
libraries can split their national namespace into smaller parts using
this method."

There are no sub-namespaces in the GB landscape so we should follow the =
pattern below:=20
urn:nbn:{ISO 3166 code}-{NBN string}

GBA267005 is an instance of the British National Bibliography number, =
i.e. the NBN string.
=20
So I think the format should be:
urn:nbn:gb-GBA267005

] So, like Ben pointed out, I think the format for the bnb would be

]=20

]=20
] urn:nbn:gb:bnb:GBA267005

In either case, as far as a service like Bibliographica is concerned I
would propose to take a strategy like we already do with authors and
series and suchlike, and continue to have the data in the store as it
is now, but also put

   <http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GBA267005>
       owl:sameAs <urn:nbn:gb:bnb:GBA267005>.

That way statements that we have about this subject can be immediately
found through dereferencing, but we still have something IFP-like that
can be used to join across different datasets with information about
the same thing. Likewise for the BL if they put up
e.g. http://bl.uk/bnb/GBA267005.=20

I favour the German approach FWIW, it looks more pleasant to my eyes,
but it's not a strong preference.

] I definitely agree with you, re: the downside of using URNs.  I wonder
] if it would be worthwhile to set up a purl like:
]=20
] http://purl.org/NET/nbn/gb/bnb/{id}
]=20
] where "gb" could route to some nationally appropriate resolver?

I'm down on purl.org these days because they are being very
conservative about implementing CORS. But definitely something along
these lines could be quite useful.
