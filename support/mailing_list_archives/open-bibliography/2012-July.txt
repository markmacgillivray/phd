Subject: [open-bibliography] biblios.net code/data?
Message-ID: <4FF4D2AB.9000107@theseamans.net>

Does anyone know if the biblios.net z39.50 server data or code (it was
open source of some kind) is available anywhere? Someone mentioned
github to me, but I can't find it there. As far as I can see the
cataloguing service is now dead since it depends on Google Gears. I
believe Liblime simply let the service fade away, but I may be wrong -
maybe someone has revived it elsewhere?

I don't know why the service died either - was it just a casualty of the
Liblime/Koha fiasco, or commercially unviable, or did they run into
legal prolems with putting random catalogue data under PDDL?

Apologies if this is all well known to everyone else on this list, I'm
kind of late to the party...

Thanks

Graham

The biblios.net code was called just biblios and was hosted on
biblios.org. It used PazPar2 didn't it?

A copy of the server code is
http://git.librarypolice.com/?p=biblios.git;a=summary
as git.biblios.org seems to have gone away.  It's GPL so that should
survive its original host's neglect, although it doesn't look like
it's under active development just now.

(Koha wasn't part of any fiasco... it's kept ticking along,
cataloguing books, even when certain developers may have been fiascking.)

I doubt the service ran into legal problems, as biblios.net looks
still up (although not useful now, as you note) - it's only the GPL
software site that seems to have been killed off and turned into a
redirect to the not useful biblios.net site.  Maybe it wasn't a focus
for LibLime's new owners and no-one else wanted it enough to fund it?

Hope that helps,

Additionally: http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/657 is a nicer
introduction than the developer docs included in the repository.

Maybe someone able-bodied can note the code location as a comment on
that article.  I can't because of the "No Dogs, No Cripples, No Irish"
sign - sorry, I mean the reCaptcha physical ability test ;-)

Chris Catalfo also has a personal copy on github at
https://github.com/ccatalfo/biblios_old . It appears to be the same
(both last updated July 2009)

Hi Adrian,

 I'm sorry, I have a clash for this meeting - I will sort this for next
time, but apologies for today.

Outside of the blog, things have been quiet on Biblio stuff since
BiblioHack, although TEXTUS is now using BibServer:
http://textusproject.org/

Does this clash with open-academia???  If so it will split a lot of people.

Yes - perhaps we could push academia back by half an hour? I'm not sure how
many people are affected, but you and me for certain... Let me contact them
and find out.

Just confirming re open-bibliography and open-academia calls, I will miss
both as currently at OR12 conference.

To: okfn-discuss <okfn-discuss at lists.okfn.org>


Dear All,

Big news today that the brilliant Linked Open Vocabularies
project<http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/index.html>has now officially
migrated to Open Knowledge Foundation servers. We are
very pleased to welcome this fantastic project to the family.

For those who don't know the the Linked Open Vocabularies Project can be
summed up in 5 simple points:

   - LOV is about vocabularies (aka. metadata element sets or ontologies)
   in OWL / RDFS used to describe linked data.
   - LOV provides a single-stop access to the Vocabulary Commons ecosystem
   - LOV helps to improve vocabularies understanding, visibility,
   usability, synergy, sustainability and overall quality
   - LOV promotes a technically and socially sustainable management of the
   Vocabulary Commons ecosystem
   - LOV is a community and open project. You are welcome to join the team
   of gardeners of the Vocabulary Commons!

Read more about it in Pierre-Yves Vandenbussche's post for the Open
Knowledge Foundation
blog<http://blog.okfn.org/2012/07/10/announcing-linked-open-vocabularies-lov-enabling-the-vocabulary-commons/>.
Please do circulate this news to your friends and networks.

All the best,
Sam

(Apologies for cross-posting)

Hi Open Biblio Community,

For the last six months the Open Knowledge Foundation has been working on a
new EU project called Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana
(DM2E<http://dm2e.eu>).
The aims of the project are to enable as many content providers as possible
to integrate their collections into Europeana and to build open source
tools for the re-use of this data.

We now have prototypes of two of these tools, Korbo and Pundit, that are
ready for user testing. I'm sure these tools will be of interest to many on
this list. Please do try them out and give us feedback via the Google Forms
below so that we can improve the tools on future iterations.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions about the
project as a whole or the tools below.

All the best,
Sam

*Korbo*

Korbo is a powerful aggregation platform for gathering Linked Data objects
relevant to your area of research into single workspaces or ?baskets?.

Korbo is targetted priarily at developers who want to build applications on
top of its API and make full use of linked cultural data from sources such
as Europeana, FreeBase and DBPedia.

Korbo is currently in the early stages of development, but you can already
try out a demo version of the platform. Please do give us feedback on your
experiences as this is invaluable information for future iterations ? Korbo
user feedback questionnaire<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHNXd0ZleUx5RDlYZTRTekFJLWtVZGc6MQ#gid=0>
.

TEST KORBO <http://korbo.muruca.org/demo.php>

*Pundit*

Pundit is a powerful but easy to use semantic annotation tool that can work
with the objects collected within a Korbo ?basket.

It enables you to link sections of text to each other or to other Linked
Data resources on the net such as DBPedia, Freebase and Geonames.

Pundit is currently in its Alpha phase, but you can already try out a demo
version of the platform. Please remember to give us feedback on your
experinces of Pundit via the Pundit
questionnaire<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dExoMEV1MGJEcm9PNzF4VkI2NzZBRXc6MQ#gid=0>

TEST PUNDIT <http://thepund.it/demo.php>

*Going forward*

Both tools will continue to be developed as part of the DM2E (Digitised
Manuscripts to Europeana) project on the basis of feedback we receive from
user testing and continuing work on user requiremnets and scholarly
primitives led by Professor Gradmann at the Humboldt Universit?t.

To follow the project and receive updates about events, conferences and
code sprints we are running, please sign up to the project mailing
list<http://sympa.cms.hu-berlin.de/sympa/subscribe/dm2e-news> or

Dear Colleague,

BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine is pleased to be able to
add scientific rigour to the debate about open access research, by
publishing an article which compares the scientific impact of open access
with traditional subscription publishing and has found that both of these
publishing business models produce high quality peer reviewed articles.

Open for business: open access journals reaching the same scientific impact
as subscription journals

BioMed Central's open access journal BMC Medicine is pleased to be able to
add scientific rigour to the debate about open access research, by
publishing an article which compares the scientific impact of open access
with traditional subscription publishing and has found that both of these
publishing business models produce high quality peer reviewed articles.

The debate about who should pay for scientific publishing is of continuing
importance to the scientific community but also to the general public who
not only often pay for the research though charitable contributions, their
taxes, and by buying products, but are also affected by the results
contained within these articles.

Many publically funded agencies, such as the Wellcome Trust and NIH require
that scientific research sponsored by them is made freely available to the
public. However the issues aren't as simple as just putting the results of
your research on line. Scientific research goes through the quality control
filter of peer review and journals act as gatekeepers performing
quality-assuring peer review, and who provide web-based repositories.
Scientists currently rely on publishing in peer reviewed high quality
journals to show that their research itself is of good quality, is of
importance to their field of research, and consequently improves their
chances of obtaining funding to continue their work.

One way of measuring quality is by impact factors calculated from citation
data (how many times other scientists have mentioned the research).
Bo-Christer Bjork from Hanken School of Economics, Helsinki, and David
Solomon from Michigan State University compared the impact factors of 610
open access journals and over 7000 subscription journals.

The citation rate for subscription journals was overall 30% higher than for
open access ones but this difference was largely due to a high share of
older OA journals, particularly from regions like Latin America in the
citation indexes. When like was compared with like, for instance, journals
founded after 2000 from difference regions or disciplines, the differences
disappeared.

Bo-Christer Bjork, explained, "The open access debate has included
accusations from some traditional publishers and their lobbyists that Open
Access publishing implies low scientific quality and endangers the quality
assurance function of the peer review system that the academic community
and publishers have built up over decades."

Explaining the results Prof Bjork said, "If you take into account the
journal discipline, location of publisher and age of publication the
differences in impact between open access and subscription journals largely
disappear. In medicine and health, open access journals founded in the last
10 years are receiving on average as many citations as subscription
journals launched during the same time."

David Solomon continued, "It is easy to see why scientists might be
sceptical of electronic, open access journals - after all they have their
reputation to maintain. Open access journals that fund publishing with
article processing charges (APCs), sometimes called gold open access, are
on average cited more than other OA journals. Since the launch of
professionally run high quality biomedical journals in 2000 gold OA has
increased by 30% per year and many of these are on a par with their
subscription counterparts."

Subject: [open-bibliography] Hesperia goes open access
Message-ID: <20120713074426.BKY66723@mstore00.uchicago.edu>

The American School of Classical Studies announced this week an open access version of Hesperia.  All articles beyond the three-year moving wall are now freely distributed on the School?s website for individual use.

In mid-June the ASCSA also announced Open Linked Hesperia Bibliographic Citations: Bibliographic citation data for 1,500+ Hesperia articles are now freely available on Zotero. ASCSA monographs are also on Zotero in the ?ASCSA Books? collection, organized by series (e.g., Corinth, Isthmia). This is a work in progress, with about 70 more books to be added to complete the open bibliography of all ASCSA publications. 

Andrew Reinhard and his colleagues in the Publications Department and the Publications Committee of the School?s Managing Committee are to be congratulated for making this important move.

Hi all,

The EU press release<http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/12/790&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en>concerning
the open access to data and publications notes

The European Commission will continue to fund projects related to open
access. In 2012-2013, the Commission will spend ?45 million on data
infrastructures andresearch on digital preservation. Funding will continue
under the Horizon 2020 programme. During the same period, the Commission
will support experimentation with new ways of handling scientific
information (e.g. new peer-review methods and ways of measuring article
impact).

I would think that our efforts with OA index and scientific communities
with topical databases are also eligible for funding as "new ways of
handling scientific information"
What do you think?

Certainly. We need partners - and of course European funded is competitive.
But I would think that something based on Datahub + malaria could look
attractive.

This looks very exciting

I have crossposted to open-bibliography because Bibserver should be able to
ingest the metadata and manage it as a Bibsoup.

To: "open-science at lists.okfn.org" <open-science at lists.okfn.org>


Databib, http://databib.org, is a tool for helping people to identify and
locate online repositories of research data. Over 200 data repositories
have been cataloged in Databib, with more being added every week. Users and
bibliographers create and curate records that describe data repositories
that users can browse and search.

* What repositories are appropriate for a researcher to submit his or her
data to?
* How do users find appropriate data repositories and discover datasets to
meet their needs?
* How can librarians help patrons locate and integrate data into their
research or learning?

Databib begins to address these needs for data users, data producers,
publishers, librarians, funding agencies, and others engaged in data-driven
research.

In addition to the website, Databib is made available using a variety of
machine interfaces (RSS, RDF/XML, OpenSearch, RDFa/Linked Data) for easy
integration with other tools and environments without restriction (CC0).
Databib's international advisory board represents global support for
collaborating to develop such a global registry of research data
repositories.

The development of Databib was initially supported by a Sparks! Innovation
National Leadership Grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.

CALL FOR EDITORS

Nominations for an Editorial Board are being solicited to ensure the
coverage and accuracy of Databib. Editors ideally will have expertise in a
specific research domain or knowledge of research data repositories in a
particular geographic region as well as experience with descriptive
metadata. The primary role of an Editor is to review, edit, and approve
submissions to Databib and contribute to the enhancement of the metadata
and functionality of Databib for a voluntary, three-year term. The
Editorial Board will meet (virtually) a minimum of twice a year and will
correspond as needed by email.

Please send nominations or questions to databib at gmail.com, or visit
http://databib.org/about.php for more information. Thank you.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Nature strongly expands its linked data platform

Nature?s data platform strongly expanded

Nature has largely expanded its Linked Open Data platform
(http://data.nature.com/) that was launched in April 2012. From
today?s press release:

?As part of its wider commitment to open science, Nature Publishing
Group?s (NPG) Linked Data Platform now hosts more than 270 million
Resource Description Framework (RDF) statements. It has been expanded
more than ten times, in a growing number of datasets. These datasets
have been created under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver, which
permits maximal use/reuse of this data. The data is now being updated
in real-time and new triples are being dynamically added to the
datasets as articles are published on nature.com.

Available at http://data.nature.com, the platform now contains
bibliographic metadata for all NPG titles, including Scientific
American back to 1845, and NPG?s academic journals published on behalf
of our society partners. NPG?s Linked Data Platform now includes
citation metadata for all published article references. The NPG
subject ontology is also significantly expanded.

The new release expands the platform to include additional RDF
statements of bibliographic, citation, data citation and ontology
metadata, which are organised into 12 datasets ? an increase from the
8 datasets previously available. Full snapshots of this data release
are now available for download, either by individual dataset or as a
complete package, for registered users at
http://developers.nature.com.?

This is exciting, especially the commitment to real-time updates is a
great move and shows how serious Linked Open Data becomes in general
and in particular in the realm of bibliographic data. Also, Nature now
uses the Data Hub and has registered the data seperated into several
datasets (http://thedatahub.org/group/npg).

This is great news! Thanks Adrian.

For those who might have missed this on first read-through: Nature is now
using the OKFN platform The Data Hub http://thedatahub.org/group/npg :-)
