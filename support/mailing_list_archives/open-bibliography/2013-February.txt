We were in a classroom environment and there were reasons why this was a
good thing to do.

Thank you for this! I will make some time to fiddle with the conversion in
php.
Also I tried to access records from BibSoup, but I get a nice Internal
Server Error every time. Can you fix that because I need more examples to
make myself a guiding mockup.

Thanks!

Yep, that is right. You should be able to access the JSON now for any
record by adding .json to the URL or negotiating for it on the command line:

http://bibsoup.net/record/4fe9cf4eaa0abcf8ae46dcfb53d8d9d3.json

(although for the time being the records include themselves in the
"_source" parameter which is not necessary and will be removed soon. Also
you can ignore things that start with "_". They are internal)

Not critical but is there any working Bibserver I can demo in 24 hours?

The network connection where I am is a bit poor, but as far as I can tell
http://bibsoup.net should be running fine at the moment. I can access the
front page, the main /search, I can view individual records, create an
account and login after I confirm it, and upload bibjson files and create
records.

There are not currently any translators available - the code that
translated from say bibtex to bibjson has been separated out, and will be
put up at a separate URL specifically for translating. So for now you do
need a bibjson file if you want to upload, or manually create one.

Thanks = there's 102 malaria records - That's fine for demo. Does the
faceted browsing (with bubbles) work? or visible anywhere?

You can get the facets by viewing a collection. There is a test one:

http://bibsoup.net/dal/new_collection

There are no bubble vis just now, they have been removed whilst getting
redeveloped.

I'd like to run a hackfest (in AU) later this month on Materials Science
and make Bib an important aspect. Can we pull together a "hacking kit" for
such an event (e.g. examples of BibJSON, some converters, a simple BibSoup,
etc. The idea would be that people bring their personal bibliography -
their papers and/or reading list and turn it into BibJSON and put it in
Bibsoup.

I don't immediately see that this makes any information more Openly
available. It seems a closed cartel. Or am I missing something?

I wouldn't say it's changed much in the way of "openness" as defined by the
Open Definition and the various open licensing models, but it does
aggregate the indexes of Family search into an international linked data
system in WorldCat. I see it more as a start, and since OCLC is moving
toward linked open data this partnership could help foster more openness
within FamilySearch.

Cheers!

Forum.]****

*NISO Launches New Initiative to Develop Standard for Open Access Metadata
and Indicators*

** **

*Interested participants from all library types, publishers, and funding
agencies are encouraged to contact NISO*

** **

February 7, 2013 ? Baltimore, MD ? The National Information Standards
Organization (NISO) voting members have approved a new project to develop
standardized bibliographic metadata and visual indicators to describe the
accessibility of journal articles as well as potentially describe how
?open? the item is. Many offerings are available from publishers under the
banner of *Open Access (OA)*, *Increased Access*, *Public Access*, or other
descriptions; the terms offered vary between publishers and, in some cases,
based on the funding organization of the author. Adding to the potential
confusion, a number of publishers also offer hybrid options in which some
articles are ?open? while the rest of the journal?s content are available
only by subscription or license. No standardized bibliographic metadata
currently provides information on whether a specific article is freely
readable and what re-use rights might be available to readers. Visual
indicators or icons indicating the openness of an article are inconsistent
in both design and use across publishers or even across journals from the
same publisher.****

** **

?The NISO OA metadata and indicator project would complement other related
efforts currently underway,? states Nettie Lagace, NISO?s Associate
Director for Programs. ?Such projects include CrossMark, CrossRef?s update
identification service; *How Open Is It?*, a guide developed by PLoS,
SPARC, and OASPA; Vocabularies for OA (V40A), a JISC/UKOLN project;
ONIX-PL, a specification for communicating licensing terms developed by
EDItEUR; the Linked Content Coalition; and NISO?s Open Discovery
Initiative. Coordination and communication with these projects will be an
important aspect of the NISO working group?s efforts.?****

** **

?The benefits of having standardized OA metadata and indicators should have
a positive impact on many participants in the scholarly communications
chain,? explains Todd Carpenter, NISO?s Executive Director. ?Funders who
have implemented OA mandates would have a mechanism to determine if a
specific article or researcher is compliant with their policies. Publishers
of hybrid journals would benefit by having a simple mechanism for signaling
the OA status of the articles published under that model. Authors could
more easily determine whether their selected distribution option is being
respected and be able to document their compliance with funder
requirements. Readers could more easily ascertain from search results if
they can read an article for free or fee?and more easily adhere to the
terms that publishers have established. Aggregators and discovery service
providers would have an improved mechanism of programmatically collecting
and surfacing OA articles that are available in the community.?****

** **

The project launched by NISO will focus initially on metadata elements that
describe the readership rights associated with an OA article. Specifically,
the NISO Working Group will determine the optimal mechanisms to describe
and transmit the right, if any, an arbitrary user has to access a specific
article from any internet connection point. Recommendations will include a
means for distribution and aggregation of this metadata in machine-readable
form. The group will also consider the feasibility of incorporating
information on re-use rights and the feasibility of reaching agreement on
transmission of that data.****

** **

Individuals interested in participating in this working group should
contact Nettie Lagace (nlagace at niso.org). An interest group list for this
project will be available for those who would like to receive updates on
the Working Group's progress and provide feedback to the group on its work.

Please do. I am co-chairing this with Greg Tananbaum, who some of you may know from SPARC and Ed Pentz from Crossref. I should note that while there is a strand of work on permissions and rights here we are pretty explicit that we might not be able to get agreement on that from the NISO community.

The idea is that getting agreement that we can't agree on rights transmission could actually be useful and that the first step of transmitting information on whether something should be 'accessible' is also useful. I would also say that my preference is for something very simple like a standard tag for holding a link to a license.

Would be good to have OKF input.

Cheers

Cameron

	2013
Message-ID: <20130214070042.GA29304@openlib.org>

 
  OAI8, the 8th Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication will
  be held in Geneva, Switzerland, from Wednesday 19th to Friday 21st
  June 2013. Program details and registration are now available at
  https://indico.cern.ch/event/oai8. It will be possible to register
  for a part or all of the programme.

  The workshop will follow the successful format of previous sessions
  mixing practical tutorials, presentations from cutting-edge projects
  and research, discussion groups, posters, and an intense social
  programme to maximise interaction and communication. Previous
  workshops have built a strong community spirit. The event is a unique
  opportunity to exchange ideas and contact details with a large public
  connected to the OA movement. The OAI workshops are a series of the
  most important international meetings in this field and take place
  roughly every two years.
  
  Each iteration of the workshop series has dealt with issues relevant
  to today. This year, research data will be one of the topics
  tackled. In the light of the Royal Society Report "Science as an Open
  Enterprise", European universities are beginning themselves to
  consider the impact of the data deluge. The workshop will also revisit
  the topic of metrics and suggest new approaches.
  
  Thanks to the continued support of our sponsors, the organisers have
  been able to maintain the modest registration fee at the same level as
  for the previous workshop, i.e. CHF 275. Moreover, a special early
  bird fee of CHF 230 is offered until Wednesday 27th of March.
  
  Further information will be added to the website
  https://indico.cern.ch/event/oai8, including details of the Breakout
  Groups, of a pre-conference day about Duraspace, and the Call for
  posters.
  
  The committee looks forward to welcoming you to Geneva.
  
  For the OAI8 Organising Committee with cheers,

Thanks Karen. Great it sounds like they are adopting a policy which include
CC0. Does anyone know (or can anyone work out) whether CC0 will be a
requirement for all metadata in DPLA?

Two bits that I find quite bizarre:

  * "Gore pointed out that in her experience working with prospective
data-providers, most cultural heritage institutions are comfortable with
the idea that the vast majority of metadata is not copyrightable" ->
Presumably talking mainly about US GLAM institutions. Is this true? And
does 'not copyrightable' equate to 'happy to release in bulk under CC0'?
  * "Courant said that he thinks CC0 is still too restrictive of a license,
which is why he likes
using it as a ?backstop?, which the policy does." -> Not sure what 'too
restrictive' means in this context? Too open? Too strong? To legally
specific? Anyone know?

I'm not a DPLA insider, but my reading is that all contributing
institutions will be required to contribute anything copyrightable under a
CC0 license.

I think what they're going for here is that no license should be necessary
at all because the metadata can't be copyrighted.  I suspect they want that
to be their primary position, but are including CC0 as a
fallback/fail-safe.  It's a bit of a nuanced position and I could be
misreading it, but that's my interpretation.

I'm not a DPLA insider, either, but I'm close enough to say with confidence
that Tom's read of the intent, outlined in his paragraph that starts with "I
think what they're going for here," is exactly right and nicely
characterized.

This was my impression as well.

> Does anyone know (or can anyone work out) whether CC0 will be a
requirement for all metadata in DPLA?

This is an important question which may have been a bit ambiguous in the
original statement. The revised statement is clear:

"The DPLA?s partners agree that the vast majority of metadata is not
subject to copyright. To the extent that metadata provided by the DPLA?s
partners may be protected by copyright, however, those partners have agreed
to dedicate such metadata to the public domain pursuant to a CC0 license. *This
means that any raw metadata imported into the DPLA, which is protected by
copyright, is provided under a CC0 license." *[emphasis in original]

Under the statement as written, not only do contributing institutions agree
to release their metadata as CC0 via DPLA, but there is an implicit
agreement not to argue any copyright interest at all. I think the addition
of point 4 is a nice touch as well. It doesn't add anything new, but it's a
nice human readable summary clarifying the spirit of the policy.

It's an excellent statement and I think we should do what we can to make
sure that this multi-pronged approach is adopted by other large
institutions.

Oregon State University is in the process of discussing similar language
with our legal department to apply to our published datasets.

I think this is worthy of a blog post. Would you like me to start a 
draft, and I can run that by the list before posting (I can't remember 
if I can post, but Adrian can).

BTW, #4 is:

04. 	Free and Unencumbered Access to Metadata.

Given the purposes of the policy and the copyright status of the 
metadata, and pursuant to the DPLA?s terms of service, the DPLA?s users 
are free to harvest, collect, modify, and/or otherwise use any metadata 
contained in the DPLA.

[thunderous applause]

That would be great Karen! If you framed this for a general audience
(explaining background and why this is important) we could run it on the
main OKF blog...

In January, Joris already published a post "Digital Public Library of
America recommends CC0" both at the OpenGLAM blog[1] and at the main
OKF blog[2]. Though the new policy draft is more detailed, there
doesn't seem to be a significant change in content compared to the
January version of a draft DPLA metadata policy. Thus, I'd say there
is no need for another blog post. (Hope, you haven't started writing
yet, Karen.)

All the best
Adrian

Message-ID: <CAFg0Au5ALCoVDQOm3wqSPDFK7S=e0qB8F5NcuAcVeMJ9H3wC2w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Today Joshua Gans, Professor of Strategic Management and member of the Open
Economics Advisory Panel writes about the "Big Deal" packages in publishing:

http://openeconomics.net/2013/02/18/looking-again-at-big-deal-scholarly-journal-packages/

Based on the results of
Odlyzko<http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2211874>,
there is evidence for increased availability of journals as the marginal
cost of providing an additional journal to libraries is zero in the
publishers' bundles.

There are however "wrinkles to all of this" - libraries are being squeezed
as eventhough the share spent on publisher deals has increased, their
overall budgets have shrunk. There is also an argument that publishers have
now transferred the functions of libraries (as well as the libraries'
money) to themselves.

Subject: [open-bibliography] 2nd UK Ontology Network Meeting: Registration
	Open
Message-ID: <CAFvquW-cmyo6E2ZMOgM_FVoR1+FCscjHfyyfmebVunfJ1b+igA@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for cross-posting

Registration is now open for the 2nd UK Ontology Network Meeting, which
will be held at the University of Edinburgh on April 11th 2013.
Registration will be ?20 to cover catering.

Registration and a provisional programme are now available on the event
website:
http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk/events/ukont-13/2013_workshop_program.html.

The theme of this meeting is *to understand how ontology development and
application are being used to address problems* in the UK. Amongst other
areas of interest, there will be a particular focus on creating and using *open
data*. The program and audience is intentionally very diverse; the aim is
to cover areas from many disciplines. We are particularly interested in
bringing together those creating and developing the technology with those
using the technology in industry, government and public organisations.

There will be 18 short talks from leading academics, and practitioners from
major organisations and government, as well as a demo session and a
networking session.

We hope to see many of you in Edinburgh in April.  Please forward this
email to any individuals and mailing lists you think it might be of
interest to.

Many thanks,
Fiona

"LINKING TO THE FUTURE"
International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications
2-6 September 2013, Lisbon, Portugal

=============================================
2nd ANNOUNCEMENT: DC-2013 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
=============================================

DC-2013 will explore questions regarding the persistence, maintenance, and
preservation of metadata and descriptive vocabularies. The need for stable
representations and descriptions spans all sectors including cultural
heritage and scientific data, eGovernment, finance and commerce. Thus, the
maintenance and management of metadata is essential to address the long
term availability of information of legal, cultural and economic value.  On
the web, data?and especially descriptive vocabularies?can change or vanish
from one moment to the next. Nonetheless, the web increasingly forms the
ecosystem for our vocabularies and our data. DC-2013 will bring together in
Lisbon the community of metadata scholars and practitioners to engage in
the exchange of knowledge and best practices in developing a sustainable
metadata ecosystem.

DC-2013 will be collocated and run simultaneous with iPRES 2013 providing a
rich environment for synergistic exploration of issues common to both
communities.
