Hello,

tomorrow the next virtual meeting of the Working Group on Open
Bibliographic Data will take place. We should take the opportunity to
continue the discussion about the draft Principles on Open
Bibliographic Data and get the document forward. We'd also share
updates on the several openbiblio projects.

I created an Etherpad with some more details:

Hello,

I just posted the minutes for the yesterday virtual meeting on
openbiblio.net, see
http://openbiblio.net/2011/01/05/minutes-7th-virtual-meeting-of-the-okfn-openbiblio-group/

Amongst others we decided yesterday to provide an agreed "Principles
on Open Bibliographic Data" document (maybe still a late draft
version) until January 11th. We have to get the contributors list
ready for that, we have to know: Who else than the already listed
people wants to be on the contributors list of the principles?

All the best
Adrian

Subject: [open-bibliography] Openbiblio in Peter Suber's Open Access 2010
Message-ID: <AANLkTinH21T82kbsrOgoEB29evKpc_R=M62sWvjC3_uV@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

for all of you who haven't seen it yet. Peter Suber refers to Open
Bibliographic Data activities in his Open Access summary of 2010. He
even labels it "one of the most active fronts for open data in 2010":

http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/01-02-11.htm#2010

Quoting the full paragraph on openbiblio:

"After drug trial data and climate data, one of the most active fronts
for open data in 2010 was the domain of library catalog records and
bibliographic data.  OCLC invited public comments on its new draft
policy on the use of WorldCat records, which would open the data more
than in the past but stop short of putting them into the public
domain.  Library Thing launched OverCat, an OA index of bibliographic
data with some usage restrictions, second in size only to WorldCat.
Meantime, libraries around the world began lifting restrictions and
putting their bibliographic data into the public domain, usually under
CC0.  The movement seems to have started in Germany, with six
libraries in Cologne plus the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum des Landes
Nordrhein-Westfalen, and followed soon after by the University of
Konstanz, Rheinisch-Westf?lische Technische Hochschule Aachen, and the
University of T?bingen.  Outside Germany, similar steps were taken by
Cambridge University and CERN.  Late in the year, the British Library
made three million bibliographic records, or about 20% of its
catalogue, OA under CC0 and announced plans to release more, after
which the JISC Open Bibliography immediately released tools and
services to make the British Library data more useful.  JISC asked
EDINA to investigate whether OpenURL router data can (my guess:
legally can, not technically can) be opened up for reuse.

JISC released a toolkit to help librarians share their catalog
records, and followed it up with an Open Bibliographic Data Guide for
institutions providing OA to library catalogue records.  The Open
Knowledge Foundation launched a Working Group on Open Bibliographic
Data, which soon released a draft version of Principles on Open
Bibliographic Data for public comment.  OKF also released a preview of
Bibliographica, its new open-source tool to gather and share
semantically rich bibliographic information."

Hello,

as decided in the last meeting[1] we want to get the openbiblio
principles towards an agreed upon document until January 11th which is
next Tuesday. I've already made some more changes on the google doc
and added comments to the document to initiate further discussion, see

I'm looking forward to your thoughts and comments.

EPrints.soton, our main EPrints server, now provides RDF and sensible URIs.
http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/cgi/export/eprint/12321/RDFXML/eps-eprint-12321.rdf

EPrints.ecs.soton.ac.uk has provided this for some time (one day these 
two repositories should be merged, but it's a scary job)

We also provide similar data from our 'edshare' teaching materials 
repository:
http://www.edshare.soton.ac.uk/

What these don't yet do is join the data up in any sane way, they each 
use different URIs for authors (person identity is a bit of a rabbit 
hold in such a large organistation with many co-evolved systems!)

Suggestions on how to make this more useful will go a long way as I can 
alter the next release of the software, rather than just our local copies!

Also, in principle I'd like to look at exposing the library database as 
open data, including number of copies available currently for loan. Any 
ideas?

I have read Adrian's latest version, with Karen's additions and I think it's
excellent. I agree with Karen that we should have a simple para rather than
bullet list. I also agree with the idea of Core data and the addendum.

I would like to launch this formally at our Symposium on January 17th.
http://www-pmr.ch.cam.ac.uk/wiki/Main_Page I am speaking at 1700 UTC and
have 30 minutes but I would like to take a few minutes to launch Open
Bibliography as a part of Open Scholarship.

I think that we can get modest coverage of this - Nature and BMC will be
there and if I announce this today we might even get other parties
interested.

**Adrian is the senior author of this** and I am suggesting that he spend 1
minute greeting us (time is very tight and we didn't plan this when we
started!) It would be great if we have all our authors represented on Skype
even if they only get to say "hi".

The conference booklet will highlight Open Bibliography, the British
National Bibliography and #jiscopenbib

The presentation will be streamed and recorded. There will also be a
twitterfall.

If you agree I will announce this as "Launch of Open Bibliography
Principles"

I am impressed with the compactnerss and precision that the group has
achieved. I think it will be possible to get a lot of organizations signing
up to this.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Library of Congress subject headings & RDF
Message-ID: <AANLkTik3+YfO17T8EZNM1Y=Nc8kLZQW2O7k=5d+3iHtq@mail.gmail.com>

Can anyone point me at (or advise me on) examples of representing subject
heading fields from a library catalogue record as RDF. Specifically I'm
interested in how chained sets of subject headings are represented.

E.g. a library catalogue record might have a heading:

650$$aPopular Music$$xHistory$$y20th Century

Each one of these headings:

Popular Music
History
20th Century

will have a SKOS representation on id.loc.gov, but to represent each heading
separately as a dc:subject (or similar) would lose the context of chaining
them together.

There are some entries on id.loc.gov that represent some 'chains' (those
that have been 'authorised') - e.g.
http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh2008109787#concept is 'Popular
Music--History and Criticism' - but for me this doesn't feel quite right -
doesn't this lose some of the flexibility of the faceted scheme?

I'm wondering about something similar to the way BIBO handles author lists
(you can both represent each author, and the list of authors, including
order)

Thanks,

Owen

Just to bring my final comments to the list (have just added to google
doc too) :

- how about using "secondary" as an alternative to "non-core"
- I think the addendum may be fine as a CSV as opposed to a bulleted list

Great work everyone, it looks really good.

As I mentioned the other day in IRC to Rufus, my only comment is that
the strong anti-copyleft position might not be the best. Public domain
terms might be appropriate for large institutions, particularly state
funded ones, but small independently funded organisations that improve
data should be able to prevent their work from being enclosed by the
likes of Amazon and still be able to call their data Open.

Hmmm... I think of your example as a single heading with multiple parts.
Something like "Popular music -- History -- 20th century" isn't really
about "History" or the "20th century" except as those things relate to
popular music, after all.

The only thing you really lose in the SKOS representation at id.loc.gov
is the explicit typing of the parts.  (That is, there's nothing explicitly
saying that the "20th century" part is a temporal subdivision rather than a
generic topical subdivision.)  Though I've found I can do much of what I need
without tha.  (If anyone here will be at ALA Midwinter on the 10th, I'll
be talking about what we're doing with the LC's SKOS LCSH authorities
in the Subject Analysis Committee meeting Monday afternoon.)

If you really need subfield typing, it can often
be reconstructed in various ways.  Geographic terms follow standard
enough string patterns in LCSH, for instance, that I can generally pick
them out even without explicit typing.  Likewise, temporal subdivisions tend
to have certain patterns, such as '[year]-[year]" or "[n]th century".
Alternatively,  have access to a set of MARC records that has subdivision 
typing, you can analyze the existing strings there and see which strings
tend to go with which type.)

Alternatively, the MADS format that LC will be using in the future is
an RDF format that does include explicit subfield typing in the LCSH
authority data.   It's not yet available on id.loc.gov, but I shared
a podium recently with an LC speaker (Kevin Smith) who said it's on its way.
(SKOS will also continue to be available.)

Owen, I think this is the problem that LC is trying to solve by  
creating MADS in RDF.

http://www.loc.gov/standards/mads/rdf/

Note, however, that there were a number of criticisms of this draft,  
on the MODS list:
   http://listserv.loc.gov/cgi-bin/wa?A1=ind1012&L=mods

And you are right that using the string with "--" loses a great deal  
of meaning, but it was done that way to fit into SKOS, which doesn't  
natively have a way to structure the subject heading fields.

I don't know of a working implementation, which is what you are  
probably looking for.

This seems to go in the same direction as the discussion Rufus
initiated at the last meeting, doesn't it? In the minutes[1] it reads:

"A question to be resolved is: Do we need in the 4th principle (??it
is STRONGLY recommended that bibliographic data or collections of
bibliographic data, especially where publicly funded, be explicitly
placed in the public domain??) a ?STRONGLY? recommend for public
domain or should we drop the ?Strongly? and simply recommend? The
underlying question is whether attribution is rather a problem or a
benefit in the future bibliographic data environment."

You now have posted another "underlying question" to this: Does the
current wording scare of small organisations to open up their data?

I wouldn't mind dropping the "STRONGLY". What do the others think?

iff the subject headings can be considered owl:Class then you could
express this with,

:book dc:subject [
    owl:intersectionOf (:PopularMusic, :History, :20thCentury)
].

I could also imagine an inference rule that constructs an 
appropriate label/value for the thing.

But maybe this is unwieldy?

Hi Owen,

I agree that the status quo at id.loc.gov is pretty unsatisfying (on
several levels, including this one) and this is one the things that I
changed for lcsubjects.org in the last redesign (although it's
certainly not "fixed" or even remotely standard - but it was intended
to get the conversation started in this direction).

Thankfully, though, your specific example works :)

http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh2008109787#concept

For subdivided subject headings like this, I've added a few
properties: lcsh:coordinates, lcsh:generalSubdivision,
lcsh:chronologicalSubdivision, lcsh:primaryConcept, etc.

The RDF out of lcsubjects.org is pretty brutally verbose, but directly
out of the Platform it looks like:
http://api.talis.com/stores/lcsh-info/meta?about=http%3A%2F%2Flcsubjects.org%2Fsubjects%2Fsh2008109787%23concept&output=xml

and the coordinates resource is an rdf:Seq (to preserve order):

http://api.talis.com/stores/lcsh-info/meta?about=http%3A%2F%2Flcsubjects.org%2Fsubjects%2Fsh2008109787%23coordinates&output=xml

This is still totally a work in progress (and incredibly incomplete),
but is intended to begin to provide the sort of semantics that you're
looking for (I think).  It also (I hope) begins to lay out a
foundation for how LCSH is actually intended to be used (which is a
set of building blocks).  So to take your original example,
"650$$aPopular Music$$xHistory$$y20th Century"

This could be created like:

<http://example.org/book/1>
    dcterms:subject
<http://example.org/subjects/popular-music--history--20th-century#concept>.

<http://example.org/subjects/popular-music--history--20th-century#concept>
    lcsh:generalSubdivision
<http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh99005024#concept> ;
    lcsh:chronologicalSubdivision
<http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh2002012476#concept>;
    lcsh:primaryConcept <http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh85088865#concept> ;
    a skos:Concept ;
    skos:prefLabel "Popular Music--History--20th Century" ;
    lcsh:coordinates
<http://example.org/subjects/popular-music--history--20th-century#coordinates>
.

<http://example.org/subjects/popular-music--history--20th-century#coordinates>
   a rdf:Seq ;
   rdf:_1 <http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh85088865#concept> ;
   rdf:_2 <http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh99005024#concept> ;
   rdf:_3 <http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh2002012476#concept> .

(the lcsubjects.org URIs could just as easily be id.loc.gov URIs -- it
was just easier to cut and paste from existing data).

With this, it's much easier to make our uncontrolled subject headings
that are composites of a bunch of controlled headings.

Like I said, this is pretty incomplete on lcsubjects.org, currently,
mainly because there's a lot missing (namely the corporate names and
random chronological subdivisions, but there are also subdivision
terms that don't appear to be derived from an authorized heading).
See: http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh2010007497 or
http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh85045754 as somewhat different
examples.

The first one has a URI for Austria, but that URI returns a 404 (I
built this from the Fred 2.0 data, so I have the NAF, I just haven't
figured out how to incorporate it into lcsubjects.org, yet).  The
second one shows an unauthorized chronological subdivision -- so,
currently, it just drops it.

Here's another example:  http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh85134593#concept

this should use: http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh99005746#concept as
the general subdivision -- but that's an altLabel, so it's currently
failing (as you can see, this is wrought with frustations!).

Another mind bender: http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh2010106574#concept

This one chokes, because "Polyglot" isn't an authorized term (instead
it should be using http://lcsubjects.org/subjects/sh85037700#concept
-- "Dictionaries, Polyglot") and was created after Fred 2.0 (3.5 years
after!), so I don't have access to the MARC authority record to
properly look things up (not that it would help me in this case,
anyway [1]).

So, to try to bring this on home..., I think there are solutions (and
linked data solutions) to this, but LC is doing very little to enable
it.  If they'd provide the original MARC as a format for the concepts,
that would be a start -- but, honestly, without all of the data
available (including the NAF), this is going to be half-baked.

So, anyway, thanks for prompting me to write a bit about this :)
Probably worth forwarding to the SKOS list, as well.

-Ross.

[1] Here's the MARC record for Plastics--Dictionaries--Polyglot:
000 	00476cz a2200169n 450
001 	8244985
005 	20100420002715.0
008 	100413|| anannbabn |n ana
035 	__ |a (DLC)464428

667 	__ |a Record generated for validation purposes.
670 	__ |a Work cat.: Fachwo?rterbuch Kunststofftechnik, c1992
953 	__ |a tc00

so there's still not an obvious way to know that one should be looking
for Dictionaries, Polyglot.

Thanks All

My immediate reaction to MADS is that it is just far too complicated - I
can't imagine querying data in this format myself, nevermind for people less
familiar with library data. (Chris Gutteridge's post on 'The Modeller'
springs to mind http://blogs.ecs.soton.ac.uk/webteam/2010/09/02/the-modeler/
)

The question of querying the data also is something that concerns me about
treating the coordinated heading as a single heading. While I can see the
point John makes about the book not being 'about' the 20th Century, it feels
reasonable that I could write a SPARQL query on any of the individual parts
of the heading and still get the item back.

Ross's approach is the closest to the vague ideas in my mind, and feels like
it is about right in terms of the balance between pragmaticism and
precision, and seems that it would easily support the immediate types of
query that spring to my mind. So - if there is anything I can do to support
this I'm definitely interested...

However, given my current timescales I suspect that the only immediate way
forward for me is to pull out each individual subject heading to link to
id.loc.gov, and then include the coordinated string as a dc:subject literal
(I guess linking again to id.loc.gov if it has already been authorised).

Ross - I'm not on the SKOS list - do you want to copy your post over there?

Hello Jim,

thanks for your valuable input. I incorporated both your proposals
into the document. In principle 3 it now reads: "These licenses make
it impossible to effectively integrate and re-purpose datasets. They
furthermore prevent commercial services which add value to
bibliographic data or commercial activities which could be used to
support data preservation."

I hope everybody is OK with this. Anyway, it's still time for more
changes. e.g. to change the "strongly recommend" part...

As attachment a PDF version of the current principles draft which
Peter might use for the symposium. Fortunately it fits on two pages!
(Karen, as I made some more changes I created a new pdf.)

Adrian, I have one more thought. I suggest putting into "Secondary data"
"indication that one work is derived from, related to, or cited by another work"
This is a nice rhetorical progression, because few would deny that the fact of one
work being derived from or related to another is essentially public domain, and
citation by citation one could make the case for "cited by" too. Publishers
often engage in the noxious practice of making citation lists available only to subscribers,
and citation idexerss hoard the citation data. This is something we should  be pushing back against.
One of the greatest potential benefits of open biblio in the journal article space is if
we can open up the citation graph which was until recently controlled by Thomson-Reuters, 
but which is gradually becoming more open due to efforts of CiteSeer, Google Scholar,
Microsoft Academic Search and others including David Shotton and myself. We need to make the point 
to publishers that it is in their own interest to release their citation data and allow it to be fully processed
by the community without licensing retrrictions. And too bad for the current citation indexers if they get disintermediated.

Also, we should definitely not make a statement of open biblio principles which might later be used against
us by saying even we did not indicate citation data might be covered!

This comes back to the copyrightable/non-copyrightable issue. Our point should be that  whether or not various
elements of this biblio data are copyrightable or restrictable by licenses, it is in the greater interest of the scientific 
community for publishers and data aggregators to make all this information freely available. Then let the various agents compete with 
each other on a new playing field for the quality of services they can provide over this data, rather than competing for control of the data.

Absolutely. As you know David Shotton is funded to do this by JISC

I have consistently made a distinction between Bibliography and Citations -
and indeed defined (my own view) or Open Scholarship as Open Access,
Bibliography, Citations and Dataq (OABCD). The reasons are both taxonomic
and pragmatic. See below

> We agree on the motivation, but many will not. So my position - and I think
it's covered by the principles - are:

Bibliography has an objectivity which defines a set of objects and their
addresses/identifiers.  In this sense they are a unique set - an exhaustive
collection of the worlds' bibliographic data should be platonic - it should
be the same whoever creates it. Of course there are edge cases, but for
articles this is essentially true. Each article has a single core
bibliographic data (I treat data as singular when I feel like it!) and if
this data is not available the article "does not exist". It's similar to car
licence plates, phone books, addresses of institutions.

There is no motivation ("sentiment") attached to bibliographic data. It
addresses and identifies. The "core-data" doesn't comment. It may attach
factual information such as language, document format, rights, etc. Every
piece of this core-data can in principle be precisely verified by examining
the artifact. (I don't want to get into FRBR here...)

By contrast the citations are subjective and potentially ambiguous or
"wrong". In an ideal world the bibliographic data are nodes in a graph and
the citations are (annotated) edges. In practice many citations point to
non-existent or ambiguous nodes  - and this is in some cases irresolvable.
An article can be created (and many are) without citations. An article must
have a single set of bibliographic data.

There is also a pragmatic aspect. Whether we like it or not the citations
are often hidden behind paywalls and are often regarded as the property of
the publisher. We may not like it and we may attempt to change it but it's a
current fact. It will take time (years?) to get Citations made Open. We have
strategies - which include author support, beneficient journals, funder
requirements etc. and these will win, but at present this is a much more
messy area than bibliography.

So we should not let Citations and Bibliography get muddled - they are
different things. I'm not quite sure what you are proposing - that
bibliographic data should include lists of citing authorities? If so this is
technically hard, and is dynamic (whereas much Bibliography once created is
effectively static for ever after).

So I would argue against adding this - we are already tackling citations and
will continue to do so, but it's a longer effort. If we can get Open
Bibliography adopted - especially across a wide section of the community -
authors, academia, publishers, funders, etc. we can move to the next
challenge.

Open Bibliogtaphic Data is concise and compelling. I expect we can get many
people/orgs to sign up to it. That enhances our credibility.

Isn't there also the issue that citations are considered part of the  
text of an article? In that sense, they are included in the  
copyrightable portion. However, if a third party reads the article and  
makes the connections between citer and citee, then this may be a  
separate declaration.

It is an unfortunate fact that many citations are "literary" rather  
than "factual" and Peter is right that a whole lot of citations don't  
connect up to anything in the bibliographic world. One of my dreams is  
that citations would be derived from bibliographic data (rather than  
being composed by authors) and would therefore contain the actual  
connections needed to be able to declare them as truly "bibliographic  
DATA". The capability for this almost exists in software like EndNote  
and Zotero, where citations are merely displays from actual data.  
Keeping these connections as linked data would be ideal.

Sure, but in the U.S. at least, you cant copyright facts. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feist_v._Rural
It is simply a fact if an article I write cites another article.
Copyright does not prevent me from reading an article and making a list of what articles it cites.

Right, this is pretty much my point. As far as I know this facet of copyright law has never been tested,
so it is really a gray area. But in any case, there is nothing to prevent us advocating to publishers that
they relinquish whatever hold they might think they have on citation data. I'm working on this issue specifically
with the Institute of Mathematical Statistics, which is a non-profit academic publisher with a very high
quality store of citation data, and I would like to see broader support for efforts of this kind.

This is really not the case in disciplines with a strong journal heritage like math and stat.
There is really no difficulty in identifying citations in these fields with biblio records of the
original articles in various databases.

This is already reality in my fields. Most articles I deal with have citation lists which the publisher links to MathSciNet and Zentralblatt.
In the case of data on Project Euclid at Cornell these data are readily harvested to form an open  citation index, with no objection
from the host, and I am planning to do that and encourage others to do the same.

Indeed. I am pushing towards that goal.

First I understand Jim's position - the issue is how we address it.

We have been through a lot of this in Panton for Open Data in Science. I can
argue that a graph of yesterday's weather is simply factual. But oponents
will argue that its an image and that all images are copyrightable. I might
win in court - I might not. So I think that claiming that citations are
facts will not win in some/most courts.

Karen is right that currently citations are behinde the paywall and are
regarded as part of the text of the article. We are almost the first group
to challenge this. We shan't win in 5 days - it will take longer (I guess 5
years for citations).

Note also that a collection of facts is copyrightable iin Europe. We have to
win the whole world. We may tackle this by winning the hearts and minds of
people in US first and then extending. But most content holders are
multinational. We've let them invade the territory without opposition and we
have a very hard job to win it back. (If we'd done this in 1990 it would be
a whole lot easier).

So, at present we shouldn't confuse Bibliography (which will be hard but
possible) with Citations (which will be even harder).

My immediate aim would be to get all major university libraries to sign up
and also leading publishers (who do not have a bibliographic content
business - i.e. we would be unlikely to get Elsevier but we might get
Nature).

Hello,

Jim initially suggested putting into ""Secondary data" "indication
that one work is derived from, related to, or cited by another work"".
I don't see a problem to include "indication that one work is derived
from or related to another work". If this information exists in a
bibliographic description it should of course be made open too.

Concerning citations data we might first make clear what we are
talking about. Wikipedia[1] says (not general enough but ok for this
purpose):

"Broadly, a citation is a reference to a published or unpublished
source (not always the original source). More precisely, a citation is
an abbreviated alphanumeric expression (e.g. [Newell84]) embedded in
the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the
bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of
acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of
discussion at the spot where the citation appears."

I agree with Peter that in this sense citations aren't (and mustn't)
fully be covered by the principles. But I think that a big part of
citations data is already included in the principles: bibliographic
reference lists. A bibliography or reference list of a monograph or
article identifies/locates all bibliographic resources that are cited
in a text. It is an aggregation of bibliographic descriptions (as a
journal data base or library catalog is) in aphabetic order and
nothing else. (BTW, that is why "scholars" are named in the principles
as "producers of bibliographic data".)

So citations are already covered in part by the principles but not
fully because citation counts, citation context etc. aren't included.
And I don't think that we should include these. We might rather add a
phrase to explicitely include reference list. What do you think?

At least bibliographic reference lists aren't covered by copyright. In
Germany we even have a letter[2] from the "B?rsenverein des deutschen
Buchhandels" - the legal representation of publishers - which makes
clear that it is legally unproblematic to digitize and disseminate
bibliographic reference lists. (It says the same about index of
tables, lists of figures, name, place and subject indexes are listed
as not protected by copyright.)

Clearly anyone can add any secondary data. This secondary data is likely to
be more subjective or local than the core data.

Personally I'd like the boundary to be reasonably clear. I think we would
agree that the Core Data for Bibliography is:
* unique for an item and potentially normalizable
* immutable over time (except for errors and omissions)
* uncopyrightable

by contrast the Secondary data *may*  be:
* subjective (annotation)
* copyrightable in law (e.g. abstract, cover image)
* mutable over time (e.g. links/citations, annotations)
* lists (copyrightable in Europe)

If some authority claims ownership over the Secondary data then they may
have law on their side. Our approach will be to change the culture so that
they realise this is not worth pursuing and they may get more value by
making it Open.

By contrast if an authority claims that they control/own Core data then we
should persuade the community that this is currently unacceptable.

in some jurisdictions that we can't do elsewhere. There is a limit to which
content owners can reasonbaly pursue this. E.g if we creat an index of
scientific and mathematical bibliographic data then we should probably
publish it in Germany. It will be hard and create marginal returns for a
content provider to try to restrict UK access.

BTW I am glad this is an open list as it's possible - even probable - that
content providers are reading it. Gradually I think they will see that
owning bibliographic content is untenable in the long run. This is not the
music industry. The material is created by publicly funded individuals who
gain no monetary reward. Reselling this and controlling it will not play
well in the court of public opinion. Look at the OS and Open Streetmap...

Hello,

I object to classifying bibliographic reference lists as "secondary"
bibliographic data. The openbiblio principles clearly refer to
"collections of bibliographic data" and surely reference lists are
collections of what we name bibliographic CORE data.

And I thought that we - at the last meeting - have definitely dropped
any reference in the principles to potential intellectual property
rights on bibliographic data - whether on indvidual descriptions or
collections. It seems to me that you are trying to get that back in as
a significant criterium for distinciton, Peter.

Concerning the other two features of Core Data for Bibliography
proposed by Peter:
> * unique for an item and potentially normalizable
> * immutable over time (except for errors and omissions)

These also hold for bibliographic reference lists. They are indeed
normalized following different standards. Regarding your speech of a
platonic bibliographic universe, Peter, it would take more space to
explain my view which - being nominalistic - differs considerably from
this platonism. We are not arguing for opening up bibliographic
descriptions in a platonic heaven of ideas but for real bibliographic
records. There aren't any a priori given bibliographic entities. We
construct them for our purposes. Different bibliographic descriptions
in different places thus might identify bibliographic entities of
interest in different ways. (E.g. when I am talking at a party about
"Moby Dick" I am normally abstracting from any edition, language or
item information. On the other extreme, I might want to identify and
describe a specific item, e.g. a book containing annotations by a
specific person. I might identify an edition like the ISBN normally
does or an impression (embodying an edition printed in a specific
year) like catalogers do. Correspondingly, you can think of FRBR as a
model for grasping the platonic entities but I'd rather see it as a
proposal for future practice of description.)

In short, Peter, when you demand "the boundary to be reasonably clear"
I can't think of any relevant criteria to hold this boundary up. I see
no qualitative difference between a bibliographic reference list and
other collections of bibliographic descriptions like library catalogs,
journal (article) databases or other bibliographic data bases.

First, we talk about two things: bib DATA and bib COLLECTIONS. We  
agree that bib DATA must be open, and also say that those who output  
their collections need to make it clear what the terms of use are.  
Thus, we are not treating collections as "open" to the same degree as  
the facts within them.

Second, in the US, a selection of facts (e.g. a topical bibliography,  
a reading list for a university course) MAY be copyrightable as a  
whole, even if the facts themselves are not.

Third, relationships between works will begin to be carried in library  
data due to FRBR and RDA. Citation information is NOT one of those  
relationships, because libraries do not intend to include it, but it  
would be a logical extension if someone else wishes to provide it.

Hello,

interesting how the central concepts of the principles  on openbiblio
("bibliographic data", "bibliographic description") don't seem to be
shared even by the persons who worked together to write them. And
interesting how different the principles seem to be read by the
different contributors. (That could mean that the principles aren't
clear enough which I don't necessarily think...)This exciting and
important discussion seems to be necessary. Hopefully we will finally
find some agreement on the language we use...

It seem that you distinguish "bibliographic data" and "bibliographic
collections"in this paragraph and put them on the same categorial
level. It sounds as if you equate "bibliographic data" with
"bibliographic description", aren't you? IMO, the term 'bibliographic
data' as used in the principles is a general term comprising
individual bibliographic descriptions as well as collections of such
descriptions. That is why the principles refer both to individual
bibliographic descriptions and to collections (see principles 1, 3 and
4). And, to be clear, we don't just say "that those who output their
collections need to make it clear what the terms of use are" we also
want them to publish the collections under an open license and
strongly recommend a PD license.[1]

OK but that should have no influence on the principles text. I thought
(as mentioned in my previous mail) that we agreed on the principles
being agnostic about whether and where collections or individual
bibliographic descriptions are subject to intellectual property rights
or not.

I didn't argue for including citaion information in library records
(although I might as well argue for that). What I mean is, simplified:

library catalogs = printed bibliographies = journal article data bases
= bibliographic reference lists

In the context of the openbiblio principles all these things created
for different purposes and maybe greatly differing in size are nothing
else but COLLECTIONS OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTIONS. Thus, following
the above, they are all in equal measure refered to by the principles'
text.

[1] After the last meeting I thought we were past this point of the
discussion. I first publicly adressed this problem in November, see
point 1. in this mail:

* [2011-01-09 05:03:36 -0800] Karen Coyle <kcoyle at kcoyle.net> ?crit:

] Second, in the US, a selection of facts (e.g. a topical bibliography,  
] a reading list for a university course) MAY be copyrightable as a  
] whole, even if the facts themselves are not.

Reductio ad absurdum: it is a fact that the first, second and third
words of Finnegan's Wake are riverrun, past and Eve
respectively. These three facts are presumably not copyrightable. If
you enumerate all the words in this way you have a collection of facts
that is the work itself, which definitely is copyrightable. 

It is unreasonable to create an index of words used in a (particular
edition of) a work. Book ciphers work this way and are not new. So the
example is not actually so far-fetched. I could even imagine a
cataloguing system that organised books based on aggregate statistics
of an index like this - it would be a catalogue according to how
suitable a book is in itself for use with book ciphers. So then could
the words and their positions be considered bibliographic data?

Where the line is drawn is fuzzy and it is drawn in different places
in different jurisdictions. I agree with Adrian that we aren't likely
to find a practical basis for drawing the line between core and
secondary bibliographic data very sharply. It's a matter of
interpretation. 

Cheers,

It is not surprising that we have slightly different views at this stage
about what bibliographic data are. The same problems will occur in
Scientific (Panton) data. But that should not prevent us going ahead with
the principles.

We are not sure exactly where the line will be drawn but we are reasonably
clear that there is a concept of Bibliographic Data, just as we agreed there
was a concept of Scientific Data. Some of that will be problematic but we
shouldn't work too hard to try to draw lines. We are clear that there is
Core data, secondary data and content. Let's leave it as that at present.

It's possible that some of our anticipated problems will not materialise and
vice versa. Using the general terms will help concentrate discussion and
greater adoption of the Principles.

Let's go with the wording we have got and - if necessary - refine it later
in the light of experience.

P.

Couldn't this be developed on the open site that used to hold the

This is the second doc to misbehave with my Firefox this week.  I
wonder if they've "upgraded" something - but I didn't find any
changelog or release notes.  Not very open!

While these rules are for Geo data, they might be easily adapted for Bib!

I'm disappointed I've not got any feedback from this list on how to make 
bib RDF data output by EPrints any more useful. My window before we 
release the next version is VERY small so any minor tweaks go in now or 
never.

Many repositories will end up running this software so it's a chance to 
set a good (or bad) example.

While we all agree with the difficulty of precise taxonomy (for me classical
physics and chemistry is one of the places where it actually works) it's
also important to realise that rough agreement is often all that is needed
at the start. So I'd start by something like:

   - bibliography is a fundamental of scholarship, which has boundaries
   (e.g. it is distinct from geo, maths, chemistry, ...)
   - there is only one need for defining core "bibliographic data" - we do
   not need two of more systems from the outset
   - bibliographic data is (and should be) Open for the benefit of scholars
   and humankind
   - it is possible to create toolkits that manage bibliographic data and we
   have created some
   - there is general agreement that useful rapid progress can be made.

I go with the IETF mantra "rough consensus and running code". We will never
get 100% agreement on the meaning of abstract nouns. It doesn't matter at
the moment.

people to do it. There are lots of systems that output bibliographic
information that will need converting to RDF. I don't know how to do it for
ePrints - Ben is here tomorrow so I can ask him. But if you have already
created RDF then it should be simple to repurpose it if there is a mapping.

Hello Christopher,

I just had a quick look at your example[1]. Here my thoughts on this:

The object URI in the isPartOf-statement in line 56:
http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/id/repository doesn't seem to dereference.
As far as I know collection level description isn't done very often
with repositories as is the case with other collections. I'd find it
useful if EPrints supported collection descriptions of repositories
and collections within them. One might use the Dublin Core Collections
Application Profile[2] to do this (though - I have to say - I am not
fully satisfied with this solution).

There are some ontologies declared at the top of the document which
aren't used (in this description): event, void, eprel, cc, owl, geo.
It perhaps would be nicer only to declare the ontologies actually used
in the description at hand.

The rest seems to look quite well as far as I can tell.

Do you know the Document Availability Information data model (DAIA)?
See [3].

Hello,

I've been mostly a listener in this ongoing discussion and I had read
closely developing drafts of the principles, but have hesitated to
edit or suggest changes because I wasn't sure I understood the primary
argument / models driving them. It does seem now that there
may be different views underlying the concepts of bibliographic data
and the main arguments underlying the draft principles.

Some gray areas at the boundaries of the definition of "bibliographic
data" is to be expected. However, the principles might be made more
compelling if the main arguments backing these principles were made
clear -- probably mostly by reference to previously published
statements on the value of open access, and some text to put
bibliographic data in the overall context of open access.
Making these arguments explicit may also help to reduce future
ambiguity in interpreting the principle statements.

My  current take on the  four core principles is that the most
compelling cases for them are for scholarly publications, and
specifically to the sharing of  quasi-factual bibliographic
information (over which multiple coders are unlikely to significantly
disagree -- identifying and locating information, but not necessarily
subject classification and abstracting).  If this data were available
broadly, the research impact across fields would be tremendous; and
the incentives to produce such information in future would  not  be
substantially reduced. I think one can also make a very compelling
argument about the need to have open  taxonomic/ontological
information (including controlled vocabularies, etc.) that are meant
to be shared across a community -- simply in terms of network effects.
As I get farther from these cases, I'm finding it somewhat harder to
apply these unconditionally...

Alternatively, one could (e.g. in the preamble) reframe these
principles as defining "open bibliographic data" rather than as
unconditional recommendations for all possible bibdata. And then list
some the compelling advantages of open bib data for research and other
applications... This might be a good rhetorical move -- establishing
the definition of OBD would be very useful (and likely not to generate
much resistance) for those who already the see the value of open
publication, and any criticism directed at whether or not an open
model was appropriate to a particular set of pulications and/or types
of information would then be separated from the definition of what it
means to be open.

I'm probably missing important parts of past conversations, and I
apologize if this rehashes. At the same time, my guess is that similar
questions will  come up when presenting these principles to new
audiences... Is there a consensus among the main authors about what
arguments are compelling for these principles, and could this be made
somewhat more explicit?

best,

Micah

Thanks very much!

The de-reference is due to an issue with eprints.soton having an 
over-enthusiastic plugin. Try eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk for another 
example. It's a bug in that one repository that I'm working on getting 
fixed.

If that bug wasn't bugged you'd see a voID declaration for the 
repository. eg.
http://devel.eprints.org/id/repository

It declares all the namespaces that *might* be used in the serialisation 
for speed, rather than backtrack to check which were actually used.

It also provides a rather scary http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/id/dump 
URL which lets you dump all the records.
eg.
curl -H'accept:text/n3' http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/id/dump -L

I'm +1 on dropping the STRONGLY. We could still have recommend and can
phrase as especially applying to public funded institutions (where
that argument is praticularly strong).

There are differences and we should welcome them.  The differences require
us to look for what is common to all of us (and "us" means any members of
this list and beyond). We have agreed that we have something important to
take to the community.

By "Open Access" I assume we mean the general approach of the BBB
declarations - that was certainly in my mind as soon as we started.  I'd be
happy to say that the principles (i.e. the motivation and general
abstraction) are heavily informed by Open Source, Open Access and Panton
Open Data. That in itself creates a strong pre-amble

Again a major strength is that we have active participation from a wide
range of interests. It's really valuable to have the cross-fertilization
between A&H and sciences (excuse the simplicity), between monographs, theses
and articles, and between "library" and other sectors. A lot of the early
discussion highlighted the very different backgrounds and we felt that
having a single approach was valuable to the community as a whole. (I would
hate to have "POBD for libraries").

I have some sympathy with this - we create a generally acceptable term "Open
Bibliographic Data"  - rather like we created "Open Data" (which is anything
but simple, but seemed so back in 2006). But it shouldn't by itself exclude
anything.

I hacked a few ideas in a previous post. We could start off like OA by
asserting the universal and self-evidential truth of OB. That's a political
rather than an operational statement. It might be valuable.

Remember also that OB is not just a warm fuzzy approach - it's going to have
serious impact in some sectors. It's effectively saying "some of what you
have been treating as under your political and financial control actually
belongs to the public good". If we define this too precisely we may draw
lines that we would redraw in the future. What we are saying is that
"bibliographic data" should be Open. I believe that most people and
organizations will go along with that just as most people want democracy. We
do believe there are a set of inalieanble rights - e.g. author names,
titles, etc. We also know there are others which will cause dispute. We
thought we would start with those things which it would be very difficult to
challenge.

My inclination is to publish as-is, add pre-ambles and additional
categorization and see how far we get.

There are differences and we should welcome them.  The differences require
us to look for what is common to all of us (and "us" means any members of
this list and beyond). We have agreed that we have something important to
take to the community.

By "Open Access" I assume we mean the general approach of the BBB
declarations - that was certainly in my mind as soon as we started.  I'd be
happy to say that the principles (i.e. the motivation and general
abstraction) are heavily informed by Open Source, Open Access and Panton
Open Data. That in itself creates a strong pre-amble

Again a major strength is that we have active participation from a wide
range of interests. It's really valuable to have the cross-fertilization
between A&H and sciences (excuse the simplicity), between monographs, theses
and articles, and between "library" and other sectors. A lot of the early
discussion highlighted the very different backgrounds and we felt that
having a single approach was valuable to the community as a whole. (I would
hate to have "POBD for libraries").

I have some sympathy with this - we create a generally acceptable term "Open
Bibliographic Data"  - rather like we created "Open Data" (which is anything
but simple, but seemed so back in 2006). But it shouldn't by itself exclude
anything.

I hacked a few ideas in a previous post. We could start off like OA by
asserting the universal and self-evidential truth of OB. That's a political
rather than an operational statement. It might be valuable.

Remember also that OB is not just a warm fuzzy approach - it's going to have
serious impact in some sectors. It's effectively saying "some of what you
have been treating as under your political and financial control actually
belongs to the public good". If we define this too precisely we may draw
lines that we would redraw in the future. What we are saying is that
"bibliographic data" should be Open. I believe that most people and
organizations will go along with that just as most people want democracy. We
do believe there are a set of inalieanble rights - e.g. author names,
titles, etc. We also know there are others which will cause dispute. We
thought we would start with those things which it would be very difficult to
challenge.

My inclination is to publish as-is, add pre-ambles and additional
categorization and see how far we get.

Adrian, I have started systematically tagging urls of interest to the openbiblio community,
such as the 3 you listed below in previous message

> [1] http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/cgi/export/eprint/12321/RDFXML/eps-eprint-12321.rdf
> [2] http://dublincore.org/groups/collections/collection-application-profile/
> [3] http://daia.sourceforge.net/

on delicious.  See

http://www.delicious.com/tag/openbiblio

for 132 bookmarks with this tag and

http://www.delicious.com/jim_pitman/openbiblio

for 15 which I have contributed. I have lots more of this nature, many from past discussions on this list,
but have not yet applied the openbiblio tag to them.  I would be glad to cooperate with anyone interested in supporting
a more structured list of openbiblio bookmarks, with systematic use of categories or high level tags like e.g. 
technical/legal/political/economic/...  and other tags as needed.
We should be able to use the delicious API to pipe such lists to a more structured display on an okfn managed site.
I'd be glad to assist with that but I'd need some help with the internet plumbing, especially the delicious API
is fairly arcane now. e.g. It should be a scripting exercise to extract every url ever mentioned on this list  and post 
it to delicious with an openbiblio tag. But I am not able to figure out how to make bulk postings to delicious  through
their API. Anyone know how to do this?

There was BTW a rumor recently that delicious might be shut down soon:  http://web.resourceshelf.com/go/resourceblog/62691
But no matter, its a great service we could use it until it is shut down, keep our own cache of the bookmark data, and 
then repost on some other social bookmarking service.  If anyone knows a social bookmarking service with similar features to 
delicious and an easier to use API, please share that information.

Peter and others, thanks for thoughtful responses, I think its good to have this discussion.

As a strategic matter, I'm OK with not explicitly including citation data as
biblio data, if the group thinks that is strategically wise in securing quick support for the
principles. But I for one will continue to consider citation data as some kind of secondary biblio data, 
and I would favor at least mentioning it as such in the list of secondary biblio data types.

We should acknowledge that some types of biblio data, especially secondary biblio data, may be covered
by copyright in some jurisdictions. That does not prevent us from declaring that the biblio system
would provide better service to the research community if all biblio data including secondary data were opened up.
It is up to copyright owners to declare their data open. It is up to us to show them why it may be
in their own interests as well as the interest of millions of researchers to do so. There are many strategies
for that, which can be experimented with on many scales. I think we should try lots of approaches, see what is successful,
and pursue successful approaches further.

I just succeeded in getting a WorldCat Basic Search API Key and
executing a query of the form

http://worldcat.org/webservices/catalog/search/opensearch?q=[query]&wskey=[your key] 

According to the documentation I should be also able to execute

http://www.worldcat.org/webservices/catalog/content/[oclc number]?wskey=[key] 

but I cant seem to make this work. Anybody with experience of this API able to advise? Or suggest
where else I might find help with this?

I notice WorldCat now tolerates Non-Commercial use of data obtained through this API. Even if not ideal, this is way
better than their draconian terms when I last looked a year or so back.
NC seems adequate for my current purpose, which is the creation, maintenance and open publication on the 
web of comprehensive personal bibliographies. It a question for this group what license I could/should place on
such biblios containing records derived by deduplication and enhancement of records from multiple sources 
including WorldCat, MathSciNet, ZMATH, ACM Guide, Microsoft Academic Search, Google Scholar, ....
I am planning to apply CC0, and  to provide  comprehensive links back to whereever the data was derived from.
I expect that no source will dare challenge this and ask me to remove what came from their  records. For if they
do they become less visible as a biblio source. So I propose such deliberate matching and republication
of matched records with links back to sources as a general strategy for opening up biblio data, even data currently held 
by large organizations quite protective of their bibliographic turf.

In particular, I do not see that e.g. the NC clause in the WorldCat API prevents me doing this, provided
I do not put advertizing on my site, which I wont. Neither does it seem that their NC clause prevents
me from offering my cleaned and merged data as JSON/RDF/whatever, which other agents could then harvest from
my site and do what they please with, even commercial things.

Suggestions/reactions welcomed.

Jim, one way to reach a bunch of potential WC API users is through the  
code4lib list, which is where the library code-writers hang out. They  
also have an active IRC channel where you can find people who will  
answer questions. Go to
   http://www.code4lib.org
and you'll see how to get in touch with them.

Actually, the best place to have any questions answered is the OCLC Developers Network list, which you can join by going to http://listserv.oclc.org/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=wc-devnet-l&A=1 and scroll down until you see WC-DEVNET-L.

A better way of stating this is that data obtained through the OCLC
API is restricted to Non-Commercial uses.  This means that you need to
pass that restriction on with any sublicensing (presuming they
actually allow sublicensing).

Your choice of licenses is restricted to those which cover the union
of all restrictions imposed by the upstream licenses.

CC0 is clearly not in that set.

This also means that you can't contribute that data to any other
database which doesn't impose non-commercial restrictions (e.g.
Wikipedia, Freebase, etc).

Remember that the OCLC is a monopoly run by executives with million
dollar compensation packages.  I would expect them to fight vigorously
to protect that monopoly, so I wouldn't mess around with this stuff.
Get a real lawyer's advice.

I'd agree with what Tom says. There may or may not be uses for
NC-bibliography but it cannot be included in Open Bibliography as we are
using it. The increasing availability ofg NC may help change the culture but
at the bottom we have to have complete Openness.

We assert that individual bibliographic components are Open so that we can
reasonably show that we have not taken them from someone else's collection.
Since most of these are normalizable data then once we have got them, they
act as a permanent record.

If we take them from NC collections then they contaminate the rest of our
Open collection.

I am optimistic that as we get momentum then there are enough OKD-compliant
data that we can build the mass of Open Bibliography quite quickly.

I dont see why an NC clause significantly inhibits free exchange of  bibliographic data.
That is enough for my purposes. Generally, I see the arguments against NC as greatly overstated. 
There are an increasing number of agents who seem to be willing to tolerate NC, so I think it is 
important to take them at their word and demonstrate significant NC applications of their data.

Also, just because some component of bib data I use comes with an NC clause does not seem to prevent
me from saying my contribution is CC0. I claim no additional copyright layer, I declare where my
data come from and who has checked them, and move on to other things. Others can do whatever they
want with the data.  What is wrong with this picture?

> We assert that individual bibliographic components are Open so that we can

I dont see how "we" can make individual bibliographic components Open by saying they are.
Either they are by law, or they aren't, and some copyright ownner, not us, can make them so.

> Since most of these are normalizable data then once we have got them, they act as a permanent record.

OK

> If we take them from NC collections then they contaminate the rest of our Open collection.
So what? Why is that so bad? I just dont get the virulence of the argument against NC. What I do see is there
are a large number of major biblio data providers in the article space where I think I could fairly easily persuade
them to provide data NC, by arguing e.g. the OCLC has already done so, its the emerging standard, .... but it
may be very tough to get a full CC0 declaration from these sources. I'm willing to try, but I'm not going to 
spend a lot of hours on this. I'd rather spend the hours doing creative processing of data I can get hold of with NC.

> I am optimistic that as we get momentum then there are enough OKD-compliant data that we can build the mass of Open Bibliography quite quickly.

I agree with this  in the Book biblio space, but not in the Article space. I think the vested interests which hold most of the article data,
which are not the libraries but the publishers  and A&I services, may be too entrenched  to yield this data easily. Certainly, I see great
resistance in the field of mathematics.

The NC versus non-NC argument is an important one and will continue for a
long time. I can see that there are areas where NC is a useful pragmatic way
forward. We've been having these discussions with a publisher who - after
several years - has allowed <0.1% of its corpus to be made available for us
as training data to support our text-mining software (which is
OSI-licensed). That means that if we use the data for training our software
we cannot licence the data as compatible with OSI (F/OSS). We cannot
distribute our software unless we say - "you can't train this software if
you are a commercial entity" - you cxan use it but not develop your own
models using this corpus. We've argued with the publisher but we are stuck
on this. So we cannot distribute the training data.

The same would be true of bibliographic data. Suppose I wanted to develop
machine-learning on bibliographic data  - something I may well wish to do.
The NC makes it not compatible with F/OSS.

There is a huge friction associated with negotations. Many rights holders
don't reply, many set additonal restrictions. We've spent 15 months with a
publisher whos has said "yes, we can text mine their data" as long as all
the results belong to them and we don't publish any of our work. Wasted huge
amounts of our time. By contrast I can use OKD - F/OSS material without
spending more than a minute or so looking at the licence.

that's fine and we aren't stopping you. Were simply making it clear that it
can't be part of OKF's Open Bibliography.

I'm going to be pragmatic - I have to concentrate my energies on Launching
Open Bibliographic Principles on Monday. I hope the authors will be present
virtually.

As Peter says this is an important discussion and I think the OKFN's
Open Knowledge definition[1] takes the right stand by denying NC
licenses the status of openness. Instead of repeating the arguments I
provide a list of three posts on this topic worth reading:

* The "classical" text on this topic by Erik M?ller ""The Case for
Free Use: Reasons Not to Use a Creative Commons -NC License":
http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/NC

* A post by Rufus named "Why Share-Alike Licenses are Open but
Non-Commercial Ones Aren?t":
http://blog.okfn.org/2010/06/24/why-share-alike-licenses-are-open-but-non-commercial-ones-arent/

* The article "CBC decision highlights Creative Commons
drawbacks"shows how CC-NC licenses even cause someone not to use CC
licensed works at all:

I have written somewhat more expansively as I have had personal expeience of
the problems of NC.

The licence strategy of the Open Bibliographic Principles remains as being
OKD-compliant.

this is indeed a very good point. Would be good to have this FAQ for the OKD.

I will do so. I just started in a pad for collaboration. Would be really good if people could contribute and help oversee the work to make sure I am not missing some important points.

Thanks Daniel, developing an FAQ along these lines and especially including
the info [1] in a well organized form will be very useful.  Thanks to both Peter and Adrian
for their well-reasoned arguments against NC on this thread. I had not appreciated the
extent of the problems with NC before. A lot of what's currently on the web on this topic seems
emotional and dogmatic. We need to stick to reasoned explanations to be persuasive.
The FAQ format should serve well for this.

And thanks to you Jim,

The great thing about the OKF is that we tackle difficult problems and see
how far we can get and agree and how we managenecessary disagreements.
That's what's happended with Open Biblio.

Hello everybody,

as announced the openbiblio principles were launched at the Peter
Murray-Rust symposium "Visions of a (Semantic) Molecular Future"[1].
They are to be found at the openbiblio blog, see
http://openbiblio.net/principles/.

I noticed that the addendum isn't yet included. Is there a specific
reason for that?

instead we made them paragraphs?

Hello - the addendum was in the google doc but I only put up the main
text to the page at the moment - sorry. Rufus and I were discussing
where best to put the addendum info, I was thinking of putting it on a
child page at /principles/addendum, with a link from the main page
where it says "and more". Then we can add to them if necessary,
without making the main page longer and longer, becoming more unwieldy
as time goes by. or would you rather just have it appended to the
bottom?

How about putting a link on the /principles page to a downloadable
copy too, for people to print if they wish?

Thanks a lot to everyone today, and sorry to Karen that I did not get
you in on the call in time.

Mark

Massive thanks to everyone for the launc - it went wonderfully and we should
have a video/audio record which should have Mark, Rufus Adrian (skype), Ben
and me on it.

Now we have to get it signed by everyone. Start with libraries, publishers,
funders.

And we also announced the UKPubMedCentral bibliography. So we should set up
distributed groups for downloading that (ben will advise). And additional
thanks to Ben for that.

Hi All,

I've added a way for people to sign up / endorse the Principles we've
just launched:

<http://openbiblio.net/principles/>
<http://openbiblio.net/principles/endorse/>

If you support the principles please head over and sign up. I also was
wondering whether we should create a supporter web button along the
lines of:

<http://assets.okfn.org/images/buttons/panton_principles_80x23_orange_grey.png>

Regards,

Rufus

PS: There's currently a small bug with displaying your affiliation

I think it is much more important to get organizational than individual
supporters. I would like to see a list or organizations with logos comparable 
to the list http://www.orcid.org/directory
of ORCID organizational supporters. In particular, it would be very desirable
to have contact with each of the ORCID reps of these organizations, let them
know about OpenBiblio principles, and seek their endorsement. ORCID is in
a very formative stage and it is important I think to push for as much open 
biblio data as possible to be associated with ORCID.
Many ORCID participants are biblio data owners who will be reluctant to sign 
on because it may mean yielding some control or business interest in their data. But others may be willing to support, and it would be politically useful to know who those are. So I suggest an OpenBiblio campaign to contact ORCID participants
and gain their support. I am willing to work on this for organizations I am
familiar with, e.g. Cornell U, MIT, Spires, CERN, Microsoft, ... but I cant do it all. I think we need volunteers to take on these organizations one by one.
Do we have the community coordination resources to do this?
It really helps if the person doing the contacting can say they are working
on behalf of OKFN. So there should be some coordination of such an effort,
and agreement of who is working on what organization. 
It is a strategic question whether it is even worth the bother of contacting
large publishers like Springer, Wiley for across the board open biblio
support. I very much doubt it. But it may be possible to get concessions
for specific datasets, like author profiles. I expect that we can get a lot 
of the small to medium sized  non-profit publishers to support us.  CUP is a 
good candidate among medium sized publishers. I have good cooperation and 
contacts there. But Peter may be even better placed for CUP.

================================================================
Call for Use Cases: Social uses and other new uses of Library Linked Data
The W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group - http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/
Requested by February 15th, 2010
================================================================
Do you use library-related data -- like reading lists, library materials (articles, books, videos, cultural heritage or archival materials, etc), bookmarks, or annotations -- on the Web and mobile Web?

Are you currently using social features in library-related information systems or sites, or plan to do so in the near future? We are particularly interested in uses that are related to or could benefit from the use of linked data [1].


The W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group is soliciting SOCIAL and EMERGENT use cases for library-related linked data:
What new or innovative uses do you see (or envision) integrating library and cultural heritage data into applications on the Web and in social media?
How are social features used in library-related information systems?
What are the emergent uses of library-related data on the Web and mobile Web? 
How could linked data technology [1] 
enhance the use of library-related data in a social context? 
contribute to systems for sharing, filtering, recommending, or machine reading?
support new uses we may not have envisioned or achieved yet?
Some examples have been discussed in this thread [4]. 


Please tell us more by filling in the questionnaire below and sending it back to us or to public-lld at w3.org, preferably before February 15th, 2010.



The information you provide will be influential in guiding the activities the
Library Linked Data Incubator Group will undertake to help increase global
interoperability of library data on the Web. The information you provide will
be curated and published on the group wikispace at [3].

We understand that your time is precious, so please don't feel you have to
answer every question. Some sections of the templates are clearly marked as
optional. However, the more information you can provide, the easier it will be
for the Incubator Group to understand your case. And, of course, please do not
hesitate to contact us if you have any trouble answering our questions.
Editorial guidance on specific points is provided at [2], and examples are
available at [3].

At this time, we are particularly interested in use cases describing the social media and emergent uses for library linked data.The Incubator Group will carefully consider all submissions we receive. 

On behalf of the Incubator Group, thanks in advance for your time,

Jodi Schneider (jodi.schneider_deri.org) and Uldis Boj??rs (uldis.bojars_gmail.com)

================================================================

=== Name ===

A short name by which we can refer to the use case in discussions.

=== Owner ===

The contact person for this use case.

=== Background and Current Practice ===

Where this use case takes place in a specific domain, and so requires some prior
information to understand, this section is used to describe that domain. As far
as possible, please put explanation of the domain in here, to keep the scenario
as short as possible. If this scenario is best illustrated by showing how applying
technology could replace current existing practice, then this section can be used
to describe the current practice. Often, the key to why a use case is important
also lies in what problem would occur if it was not achieved, or what problem
means it is hard to achieve.

=== Goal ===

Two short statements stating (1) what is achieved in the scenario without
reference to linked data, and (2) how we use linked data technology to achieve
this goal.

=== Target Audience ===

The main audience of your case. For example scholars, the general public, service
providers, archivists, computer programs...

=== Use Case Scenario ===

The use case scenario itself, described as a story in which actors interact with
systems. This section should focus on the user needs in this scenario. Do not
mention technical aspects and/or the use of linked data.

=== Application of linked data for the given use case ===

This section describes how linked data technology could be used to support the
use case above. Try to focus on linked data on an abstract level, without
mentioning concrete applications and/or vocabularies. Hint: Nothing library
domain specific.

=== Existing Work (optional) ===

This section is used to refer to existing technologies or approaches which achieve
the use case (Hint: Specific approaches in the library domain). It may especially
refer to running prototypes or applications.

=== Related Vocabularies (optional) ===

Here you can list and clarify the use of vocabularies (element sets and value
vocabularies) which can be helpful and applied within this context.

=== Problems and Limitations (optional) ===

This section lists reasons why this scenario is or may be difficult to achieve,
including pre-requisites which may not be met, technological obstacles etc. Please
explicitly list here the technical challenges made apparent by this use case. This
will aid in creating a roadmap to overcome those challenges.

=== Related Use Cases and Unanticipated Uses (optional) ===

The scenario above describes a particular case of using linked data. However, by
allowing this scenario to take place, the likely solution allows for other use
cases. This section captures unanticipated uses of the same system apparent in the
use case scenario.

=== References (optional) ===

This section is used to refer to cited literature and quoted websites.

I've fixed this and tidied up the css. We also now show counts. Let's
get the signatories over 100!

I also note that, in response to Jim's comments, there is no reason
someone cannot sign using the current system on behalf of an
institution or organization (they can make this really clear by
leaving a comment to that affect).

Tim,

contributing your records to OCLC does not make you an OCLC "member".  
Earlier, Corinne answered this question (on some list... don't  
remember which one) that they are not OCLC members and therefore not  
subject to the record use policy.

The vast majority of records added to OCLC recently have been from  
uploads, often from national libraries. These libraries do not do  
their cataloging on OCLC and are not OCLC members. Oddly, it appears  
that they can distribute their records without any restrictions  
through any channels they choose, but any member accessing the records  
through WorldCat must abide by the record use policy. It's really very  
murky.

	discovery tools and libraries
Message-ID: <AANLkTinzYqAr8Hma+wvD_TE_w=TzjYd6atjnVvm=d=KP@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'd like to point you to a very interesting discussion that took place
recently, see the post in the blog "Pegasus Librarian"[1] and Jonathan
Rochkind's comment on it as well as the accompanying discussion on
friendfeed[2].

It's all about how academic libraries should best serve their
customers and what they should do instead of letting themselves being
locked in by vendors with big deals like discovery platforms from
EBSCO, ProQuest, OCLC etc. Jonathan has a concrete proposal how to
harvest article metadata without relying on vendors.

Besides the fact that OCLC is trading OAIster metadata (i.e. metadata
fromOpen Acces publications) I found it especially interesting to hear
about Journal TOCs.[3] Jonathan Rochkind says about it:

"Many many publishers these days provide RSS feeds with metadata of
their recent publications. By consuming these feeds, and storing what
you get over time, JournalTOCs is building a giant database of article
metadata ? that only goes back as far as when they started collecting
it. My impression is that JournalTOCs is looking for a way to monetize
this at a profit however, rather than provide it in a cooperative
cost-sharing basis."[4]

Similar approaches have already been discussed on this list. Have you
already heard about this service? Obviously nobody has objected yet
against what it does. Maybe we could approach them about opening up
the data... Interestingly, their API is licensed CC-BY.[5]

Adrian, all very interesting, and kudos to Jonathan for airing out this
issue in the blogosphere. Following are some comments.

Well, the JOurnalTOCs API is CC-BY so there seems to be no legal impediment to massively caching
and re-exposing their data, and e.g. feeding it to Krichel's authorclaim.  I can provide funding for API plumbing to feed data 
in subjects I care about from JournalTOCs to a place where I am more confident it cant be closed off and I and other biblio researchers 
have bulk access by rsync or similar for industrial processing. Anyone out there available to do this
sort of work? Or suggestions of good contractors for this purpose?
I could do some of this with Berkeley based resources, but I would much rather see a distributed effort of this kind.
I would love to see OKFN provide the server and database support for this.
I have no problem with using CC-BY for this purpose. You just stick in each record a field with
the CC-BY acknowledgement, and then these records can be freely exchanged and mixed with others.
Especially if subsequent aggregation is done with CC0, it seems there is no attribution stacking.
Anyone else can aggregrate subsets with CC0 too, and the individual records only need to carry the original
CC-BY from JOurnalTOCs.

In any case I think JournalTOCs is providing a great service, and OKFN should do what it can to engage them 
and to encourage and support their efforts.  Anyone on this list have a connection to JournalTOCs?

This is very interesting, indeed. The journal TOCs are available, but  
for the few I checked the journal article wasn't open access. This  
means that you get the citation but it isn't clear if you can then  
access the article itself. (This is the gap that OpenURL fills for  
institutions; nothing really fills that gap for the general public.)

It would be great if there were a way to link article accessibility to  
the TOC.

This should be an easy enhancement of the data by matching journal titles or issns  into the DOAJ [1]
Again, if we have the internet plumber available, I can fund as a component of the BKN effort
and give the code/data back to JournalTOCs to incorporate if they can.
Any plumbers out there with time on their hands?

(Compare PMC with ca 20 million articles)



My immediate anaylssis is that they have collected links to the publishers
sites. They do not have bibliographic records per se. I think we will still
have to scrape pages.  Typical example:

ACS Chemical biology:

This is more-or-less the journal metadata. I am not sure what came in the
RSS feed nor am I sure whether HW has transformed any of it. The actual
journal has

Identification of SR8278, a Synthetic Antagonist of the Nuclear Heme
Receptor REV-ERB

Douglas Kojetin, Yongjun Wang, Theodore M. Kamenecka, and Thomas P.

Note the affiliation (not in JournalTOCs) - which is very important for us.

In both cases we have to have a scrape to extract author names - not sure
whether they are journal specific.

==========
To extract the JournalTOCs metadata we have to:
* iterate over subjects (ca 20)
* iterate over journals (which includes multiple pages)
* extract the data for the issue

I can't see any evidence of back issues. It seems that they only expose the
current issues from these publishers (maybe I'm missing something).

I am not sure whether they have taken the publishers RSS or whether they are
specifically given TOCs by the publishers.  If the former then presumably we
can also do that.

This is their interface for human view. They also have an API documented at http://www.journaltocs.ac.uk/index.php?action=api

Right, the affiliation is missing in the RSS.  Still, the data is usable for a great many purposes, and if an author claimed
the data with Krichel's authorclaim or similar, something better than the affiliation is obtained.

Not too bad from the RSS.

This is more serious. But it appears there is nothing to stop us taking e.g. weekly or monthly snapshots
and aggregating a cache of back issues.

Right, but we do not need more than one agent to acquire and aggregate publisher's data, whatever format it
arrives in. If is its exported in a common format with an API, that seems like a great service.
Certainly for my purposes I would rather deal with aggregated data from an API like this with a common format and license
than dealing with publishers separately.

DOAJ tells you the journal's policy -- I was hoping that we'd be able  
to get an actual link to the article -- say, in a digital repository.  
But I guess for that we are back to the OpenURL or something like it  
-- something that manages the various access points.

It is not clear what they have built and whether the code and system is
Open. I believe that morally and probably contractually it should be. So
that we should be able to get their complete system for free and install it
ourselves.

Is that correct David?

Peter,

I may not have all the details here, but I believe that the JournalTOCs data and service is open and free, and the software is open source, what is potentially being charged for is a customised service on top of JournalTOCs which taylors additional services and views on the JournalTOCs data to libraries. They are looking into this as a model to sustain the underlying work and to add value.

But David Flanders/ Andy Mcgregor can correct me?
Thanks,
Rachel

So just to check this is a JISC-funded project which produces material that (after April) I will not have access to (I am not a library and I do not have 650 Eur) so it's of no use and another example of a closed system.

It is not clear what they have built and whether the code and system is Open. I believe that morally and probably contractually it should be. So that we should be able to get their complete system for free and install it ourselves.

Is that correct David?

That would be great. We have sufficient technical expertise that we can tap
into a raw stream of bibliographic data and transform it for our own
purposes (which includes integration with (UK)PMC bibliography and any other
bibliographies that may emerge (e.g. from JimP). We would regard the
JournalTOCs
as a canonical feed but would attempt to resolve against other sources
(Ben's system supports the linking of alternative and possibly inconsistent
sources). In this way we build up a Bibliographic resource which can be
searched and traversed and which is OKD-Open.

We would hope to be able to retrieve the JT back material and integrate
that. Note that we do not "normalize" data - we allow apparently identical
sources to be linked (I think that's right, Ben?).

On the assumption that we can continue to get Open feeds from Herriott-Watt
I would be happy to talk with them in depth and to see how the technologies
converge. Where do they get their feeds from?

We have bibliographic crawling technology ("pubCrawler") which can - in
principle be used to retrieve resources not in the system. This will require
customization for each publisher (probably not each journal) if we wish to
get the full Open Bibliographic Data set from a paper (e.g. the JT does not
give author location).

  I would also be happy to put the data in the OKFN sponsored
  3lib project at http://3lib.org and from there into AuthorClaim.

  But I don't want to write the software to accumulate the data.

  BTW, what about the crystallography papers data that Ben O'Steen had?
  Is that now available for inclusion into 3lib?

Hello,

is anybody else from this list - besides me and Anders S?derb?ck -
going to the ELAG conference[1] held this May in Prague? Anders and I
today chatted about proposing a workshop on open library data. As we
both already propose another workshop it would be great to find some
support for an open data workshop.

If anybody is interested, please answer via this list or mail us
directly (adrian.pohl at okfn.org & Anders.Soderback at kb.se).

Cheers

Just got back from US  but have been talking witrh Sam Adams about our tools
and we are fairly optimistic that we can technically scrape a lot. We may
need per-publisher crowdsourcing of templates, etc.

BibSonomy has a suite of per-publisher scraping tools which are openly available, and also usable
by webservice 

http://www.bibsonomy.org/scraperinfo
http://scraper.bibsonomy.org/

I suggest integration of these tools with an OKFN supported effort.

Please can you expose this dataset with CC0 or whatever as a test dataset for
the community to exercise various tools?

This looks very exciting. We'll delve into it. Not sure what the data
licence - if any - is

The crystaleye site http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye does this for *data*
and it's possible to download the data as a series of linked Atom feeds
(?Sam?). We didn't emphasize metadata when we started. There are two sorts
of  metadata - the standard journal stuff; and the in-data author list which
is often better.

I should have said we have 200,000 open data sets associated with ca 100,000
publications (guess).

Hi Adrian,

I plan to join ELAG again and would love to encourage you to do a workshop there. There is a good change that I will take part ;-) A fascinating fact is that we discussed the idea of free bibliographic data in a workshop that I gave a few years ago.... Anders was presenting the results of the workshop ;-)

Now we have open bibliographic data and the discussion can be much more fact and experience based ;-)  

Patrick

Description

===========

 

During the past few years, great and continually increasing scientific
interest has been paid towards the efficient dissemination and management of
the world's cultural assets on the Web. As more and more cultural heritage
institutions tend to exploit World Wide Web's technologies in order to
render their collections globally available, integrated access to this vast
amount of content has become an imperative need. Traditionally, the main
requisite for integrating diverse resources has been syntactic
interoperability. However, in the more knowledge-intensive world of the
Semantic Web a number of powerful techniques are offering the promise of
knowledge-based management and retrieval instead of mere syntactic data
exchange. In particular, techniques for obtaining semantic interoperability
and reasoning over metadata and ontologies have been proven powerful tools
towards this direction.

 

In the cultural heritage field, significant efforts have been initiated for
achieving semantic-aware data integration, but many issues are still under
discussion and problems remain unsolved. Hundreds of existing digital
libraries and repository systems, responsible for gathering and
disseminating digital objects originating from cultural assets, still lack
common standards and best practices for properly ingesting and publishing
knowledge. The community is looking for powerful semantic search and
navigation mechanisms able to efficiently retrieve and interlink
distributed, heterogeneous knowledge about cultural heritage. In addition,
it is not clear what might be the most suitable evaluation techniques for
analyzing the suggested methods and tools. 

 

 

======

Topics

======

 

This special issue solicits contributions to the open problems of publishing
cultural content on the Semantic Web, such as innovative techniques, tools, 

case studies, comparisons, and theoretical advances. The papers should
consider and present contributions towards representing semantic aspects of 

cultural heritage information in the web environment, i.e. aspects of
modeling, creating, aggregating, managing, publishing, and using content on 

the Semantic Web in the cultural heritage field.

 

 

In particular, topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the
following:

 

    - Semantic-enabled search and recommending

    - Reasoning over cultural heritage information

    - Semantic content creation and annotation

    - Semantic integration of heterogeneous and contradicting information

    - Ontologies and vocabularies for cultural heritage

    - Linked heritage data and its applications

    - Semantic aging and ontology evolution

    - Evaluation of semantic techniques and systems

    - Web 2.0, collaborative systems, tagging, and user feedback

    - Semantic and mental maps of interlinked cultural content

    - Visualization techniques and paradigms

    - Success reports of in-use applications and projects

 

 

===========

Submissions

===========

 

High-quality papers containing original research results on the above and
related topics are solicited. Extended versions of papers previously 

published in conferences and workshops are also welcome, provided that they
are substantially expanded and improved. Authors should submit a manuscript 

through the Semantic Web Journal on-line system, following the guidelines
available at:  <http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors>
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/authors. Manuscripts 

should have a length of 15-25 pages in IOS Press format. All submissions
will undergo an open review process, according to the standards of the 

Semantic Web Journal.

Fabiane,
Thanks very much for this. I think it's best to fork this discussion and
take it to the OKF - there is little point in my continuing to try to
contribute to semantic discussions on BtPDF as I am powerless. I'm therefore
copying this to open-bibliography.

OB people:
Background. We've had a very exciting meeting at BtPDF where we have been
identifying how to add semantics to science and medicine. The discussions
are all Open and archived and worth following. Several projects arose of
which one, the semantic analysis of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinal_muscular_atrophy has been taken as an
exemplar. We are offering to help with bibliography and citations (a wider
OKF involvement (Rufus, David Shotton, Cameron Neylon, Leslie Chan and the
OpenBib hackforce) will emerge in a few days).

In the OKF we are strictly limiting ourselves to open material. This is
because only people in rich universities can read the full medical
literature - 99.9... % of the world including patient groups is effectively
forbidden to read the literature (in case you are unaware it costs 30-40 USD
to rent (sic) a single non-Open medical paper for 2 days).

What we are allowed to read is the Bibliography in (UK)PubMedCentral because
that is in the public domain by right. We had believed that the abstract
might be subject to copyright. Now Fabiane has shown that in some
jurisdictions the abstract is specifically copyable and re-publishable.

So I am taking this to the OKF for discussion about the extent of this
permission. So - unless other BtPDFers wish to discuss this I suggest that
REPLY is only to OKF

[This doesn't alter *my* position on our projects - access to an abstract of
closed content is almost worse than nothing - it perpetuates the philosophy
of preventing people reading the literature which they have funded.]

Absolutely agreed - if we can liberate abstracts then we should do it - and
do it as part of Open Bibliography. We can't take them from UKPMC as there
are contractual aspects (I think) but we can scrape them from the primary
literature.

My strong stance on BtPDF is for the benefit of some of the academics who
believe that everyone who needs it has free access to the literature
(because only universities matter). I hadn't realised how arrogant academia
generally is. It's part of the problem.

I'd be delighted to have this reside in NZ! I think we should develop the
software to collect and index this and make it available. Maybe it will help
to encourage OKF activity in NZ.

Peter,
I should have access on the weekend of Feb 11 to people more literate than
me (not too hard since I am not a lawyer) in NZ copyright law.  So if there
are specific questions/issues it might be useful to have them identified
before then so I can try to get some responses. (e.g., court precedents or
amendments I would not be aware of). Sure, we are still not solving the full
article issue, but an abstract is better than just the title.
Cheers
Fabiana

I think one issue to look into is how jurisdictions operate online. Eg,
while we can probably copy abstracts locally in NZ I am not clear whether we
would be liable when a page is opened in another jurisdiction. I remember
having to deal with this when I was giving my webinar for Creative Commons,
and found the issues a bit confusing.

I am also having a meeting first week of March with Creative Commons
Aoteoaroa New Zealand (CCANZ) (I am a member on their panel) so they could
potentially be a good group with whom to brainstorm the issue and we might
be able to get some advise from the legal team. CCANZ now operates off the
Royal Society of New Zealand and the former CEO and Chief Librarian from the
National Library is the panel chair, as well as one of the people behind the
New Zealand Open Access Licencing Workgroup is on it too, so these are
issues they are quite familiar with and should be able to provide some
advice.

I will start looking into the list's records to refamiliarise myself with
the issues/details at hand.

Cheers
Fabiana
