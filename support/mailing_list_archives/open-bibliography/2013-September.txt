Hello,

I don't have the time to moderate this month's virtual meeting today.
So the meeting will be postponed to next week, September 10th on 15:00
GMT. (People who are at the DC conference will probably be happy about
this.

I moved the etherpad for the meeting to the new okfnpad (based on
etherpadlite) at

http://new.okfnpad.org/p/33rd-open-bibliography-meeting

Apparently there are some openbiblio activities at The European
Library (TEL) and Research Libraries UK (RLUK). Someone from the
project will report about this and will be happy about our feedback.
If you have any other stuff to report on please add it to the etherpad.

All the best
Adrian

... and I was teaching for a 3 hour block around the meeting time.  Sorry!
 Sounds like a small turnout.
