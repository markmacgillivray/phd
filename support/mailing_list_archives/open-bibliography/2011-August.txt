Hello,

I forward a mail by Giannis Tsakonas of E-LIS, "an international open
access archive for e-prints related to Librarianship, Information
Science and Technology, and related application disciplines."[1]
Contacting them months ago via isitopendata.org led to a discussion at
E-LIS about the openness of E-LIS metadata and the appropriate license
to choose. Obviously, they decided for OdbL, the attribution and
share-alike license for databases by Open Data Commons.[2]

Giannis asks the community how E-LIS could contribute its data. As far
as I know they are thinking about publishing Linked Open Data and were
quite impressed by the data that resulted from the JISC openbiblio
project. Are there any best practices for openbiblio data under OdbL?
I don't think so as all of the projects I know of have chosen a Public
Domain Waiver...

All the best
Adrian

Dear Adrian hi,

I hope you are fine.I would like to deeply apologize for my long-term
absence and the lack of information on the actions taken by E-LIS on
the issue of Open Bibliographic Data. Many things occurred in the
meantime that prevented me to get in contact with you.

I would like to inform you that the E-LIS Executive Board decided to
re-inforce the statements about the openness of our metadata by
choosing the Open Data Commons Open Database License (OdbL). It is one
of the conforming licenses that we feel that matches well with our
strategy and our content. We plan to alter our statements accordingly
in our repository.

We would like your guidance on the best practices that exist in the
area and that could forward our work to this direction. The examples
that you list in the "datasets section" of the openbiblio website are
impressive and if there are any ideas about how E-LIS could
contribute, then it would be very helpful for us.

I am looking forward hearing from you.

With kind regards

Giannis

This is fantastic news!

Giannis: could you start a (holding) page for your data on
TheDataHub.org, if there isn't one already? You can update this with
further info about your data as more details become available:

http://thedatahub.org/package/new

Also would you be willing to send us a 2-3 sentences on your use of
the ODbL for the Open Data Commons blog?

All the best,

Jonathan

NISO/DCMI August webinar announcement

***Please excuse cross-posting***

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NISO/DCMI Webinar: "International Bibliographic Standards, Linked Data,
    and the Impact on Library Cataloging"
DATE: 24 August 2011
TIME: 1:00pm - 2:30pm EDT (17:00-19:30 UTC)
REGISTRATION: http://www.niso.org/news/events/2011/dcmi/linked
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ABOUT THE WEBINAR

The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA)
is responsible for the development and maintenance of International Standard
Bibliographic Description (ISBD), UNIMARC, and the "Functional Requirements"
family for bibliographic records (FRBR), authority data (FRAD), and subject
authority data (FRSAD). ISBD underpins the MARC family of formats used by
libraries world-wide for many millions of catalog records, while FRBR is a
relatively new model optimized for users and the digital environment. These
metadata models, schemas, and content rules are now being expressed in the
Resource Description Framework language for use in the Semantic Web.

This webinar provides a general update on the work being undertaken. It
describes the development of an Application Profile for ISBD to specify the
sequence, repeatability, and mandatory status of its elements. It discusses
issues involved in deriving linked data from legacy catalogue records based
on monolithic and multi-part schemas following ISBD and FRBR, such as the
duplication which arises from copy cataloging and FRBRization. The webinar
provides practical examples of deriving high-quality linked data from the
vast numbers of records created by libraries, and demonstrates how a shift
of focus from records to linked-data triples can provide more efficient and
effective user-centered resource discovery services.

SPEAKERS:

Gordon Dunsire is a freelance consultant with 25 years of experience working
in academic libraries and ten years in digital library research. He is a
member of IFLA's ISBD/XML Study Group and FRBR Review Group, and he chairs
the IFLA Namespaces Task Group. He is currently a member of a W3C Incubator
Group on Library Linked Data.

Thomas Baker, Chief Information Officer (Communications, Research and
Development) of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative, was recently co-chair
of the W3C Semantic Web Deployment Working Group and currently co-chairs a
W3C Incubator Group on Library Linked Data.

REGISTRATION:

For registration and webinar technical information, see
http://www.niso.org/news/events/2011/dcmi/linked .  Registration closes at
12:00 pm Eastern on 24 August 2011.  Webinar presentation slides and Q&A
will be posted to the site following the live webinar.  Registrants will
receive access information to the archived webinar following the event. An
e-mail message containing archive access instructions will be sent within 48
hours of the event.

Bibliographic Data is scheduled tomorrow (August, 2nd) at 15:00 GMT.

I won't be able to attend the meeting, it would be nice if someone
else could host & moderate the call. Anyone?

Here are the local times for the meeting:

Maybe we can use this or similar occasions as an opportunity to advertise
Open Bibliography and its principles. These have not yet gone viral and we
need to think about how to do this. Especially if people ar e talking about
linked data - as the speakers are. Perhaps we should simply mail them and
explain OB.

I talked with JonathanG and JasonK today and they suggested we came up with
a 1-page explaining Open Bibliography. I completely agree. Do we have
anything to hand? If not perhaps we can hack something during repofringe?

I can make it, but with Adrian and Peter missing I suggest we postpone.
I added a few items to the pad for when we do meet.

You may already be aware of these but a couple of JISC projects completed at the end of July which are publishing open bibliographic data:

Cambridge University Library (following it's earlier release of MARC records) has now released 2.2 million records as RDF/Linked Data under ODC-PDDL (see http://data.lib.cam.ac.uk/datasets.php)
University of Lincoln have released a variety of datasets including library catalogue records, institutional repository records, e-journal (title) records and journal table of contents information - records are available via an API as RDF/XML, JSON or RIS. Data is licensed as CC0 except the tables of contents stuff which is CC-BY. See http://jerome.blogs.lincoln.ac.uk/2011/08/01/its-the-final-blog-post/ for more details.

Both projects have also produce a range of open source tools/software that would enable other institutions to do the same - some already available and some 'coming soon'

i also cant make it due to preparations for the RepoFringe this week.
However, as Jim suggests, postponing may be useful - Peter and I may
get some useful information at the conference, so we could perhaps
have a more fruitful meeting next week instead.

Wow. I feel like LOD is just become something like an avalanche --  
unstoppable movement.

I was looking at a number of LOD projects the other day and for many I  
couldn't find a statement of properties used, list of vocabularies,  
etc. That would be VERY helpful for re-use of the data. Could we do  
something to encourage this kind of documentation accompanying the  
data sets? I feel like the community might be ready for some  
"publishing data best practices," and documentation is a good start, no?

Could we do something to encourage this kind of documentation accompanying the data sets? I feel like the community might be ready for some "publishing data best practices," and documentation is a good start, no?

This is a good start too:

Hello all,

 

We've added more data to the Linked Open BNB. The dataset now includes
about 2.6 million records and generated 80, 249,538 triples. We've made
some changes based on the feeback we got on the preview subset, such as
adding links from creators/contributors back to the bibliographic
resources (thanks William!).  This is still work in progress and we're
working on resolving some known issues. More details are available at:
http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html

 

Feedback is always welcome. Please contact us at metadata at bl.uk

 

Many thanks

 

Corine

Announcement:  New Vocabulary Data Added to LC Authorities and Vocabularies Service 

The Library of Congress is pleased to make available additional vocabularies from its Authorities and Vocabularies web service (ID.LOC.GOV), which provides access to Library of Congress standards and vocabularies as Linked Data. The new dataset is: 

* Library of Congress Name Authority File (LC/NAF)

In addition, the service has been enhanced to provide separate access to the following datasets which have been a part of the LCSH dataset access:

* Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms
* Library of Congress Children's Headings

The LC/NAF data are published in RDF using the MADS/RDF and SKOS/RDF vocabularies, as are the other datasets. Individual concepts are accessible at the ID.LOC.GOV web service via a web browser interface or programmatically via content-negotiation. The vocabulary data are available for bulk download in MADS and SKOS RDF (the Name file and main LCSH file will be available by Friday, August 12).

**Please explore it for yourself at http://id.loc.gov. **

Contact Us about ID:  
As always, your feedback is important and welcomed. Though we are interested in all forms of constructive commentary on all topics related to ID, we're particularly interested in how the data available from ID.LOC.GOV is used. Your contributions directly inform service enhancements.  

The addition of Names has resulted in considerable changes to the ID.LOC.GOV backend.  Although we have endeavored to bring the service up with all pieces in place, please be patient as we work out any remaining "kinks".  

You can send comments or report any problems to us via the ID feedback form or ID listserv (see the web site).

Background:
The Authorities and Vocabularies web service was first made available in May 2009 and offered the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH), the Library's initial entry into the Linked Data environment. In part by assigning each vocabulary and each data value within it a unique resource identifier (URI), the service provides a means for machines to semantically access, use, and harvest authority and vocabulary data that adheres to W3C recommendations, such as Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), and the more detailed vocabulary MADS/RDF. In this way, the Authorities and Vocabularies web service also makes government data publicly and freely available in the spirit of the Open Government directive. Although the primary goal of the service is to enable machine access to Library of Congress data, a web interface serves human users searching and browsing the vocabularies.  The new datasets join the term and code lists already available through the service: 

* Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)
* Thesaurus of Graphic Materials
* MARC Code List for Relators
* MARC Code List for Countries (which reference their equivalent ISO 3166 codes)
* MARC Code List for Geographic Areas
* MARC Code List for Languages (which have been cross referenced with ISO 639-1, 639-2, and 639-5, where appropriate)
* PREMIS vocabularies for Cryptographic Hash Functions, Preservation Events, and Preservation Level Roles 

The above code lists also contain links with appropriate LCSH and LC/NAF headings.  Additional vocabularies will be added in the future, including additional PREMIS controlled vocabularies.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Proposal for a Retraction index
Message-ID: <CAD2k14Mtvig_edkmGV5-yLKGchASqtmtU3+3h0M7JK8j_Em-Ug@mail.gmail.com>

Apparently scientific retractions are increasing at a ptremendous rate
http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2011/08/11/scientific_retractions_a_growth_industry.php
(A retraction is where a  previously published paper is retracted. This may
mean it is expunged form the scientific record by the publisher or simply
stamped as RETRACTED). Retractions are usually because of sloppy science (ca
75%) or fraud (25%) - Ben O'Steen has done a nice piece of work showing the
citation network relating to the retracted MMR vaccine paper.
In
http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/
there is a call for a retraction index. Note that the original retracted
paper may be unaltered (especially if it's been copied to a personal
machine) and it won't be obviously "wrong"

If we created a BibJSON Open Retraction index I think there would be a lot
of interest. It would also allow us to label other papers which
(recursively) consumed retracted work.

There's currently a few hundred or lwo thousands  retracted papers so it's a
feasible project for a hackathon or an obsessive human.

Carl Grant from Ex Libris has answered some questions I asked him
after the announcement of the expert group. I posted his response on
openbiblio.net and the OKFN blog, see e.g.

http://openbiblio.net/2011/08/11/ex-libris-alma-and-open-data/.

By now, he calls the group "Community Zone Advisory Group", the "open
data" part has disappeared. Nonetheless it seems as if Ex Libris
really takes an open approach for the new system, as the agreement for
the Alma community zone "replicates the key terms of the Creative
Commons PDDL license for customer-contributed records".

All the best

Adrian, there isn't a name change -- the group is still working to  
describe open data in Alma -- that was adjectival, not a name.

I'm still trying to figure out the underlying design, but it seems  
that Alma will have a primary database of bibliographic records that  
will be shared among the users and that must be under a PD-type  
license, either CC0 or PDDL. It will also allow local, private  
databases for library records that cannot be shared openly (e.g. ones  
that come to the libraries from the book vendors and have license  
conditions). So each library will have some records in the general  
pool plus a private section of its own, if needed. The Alma policy is  
only about the "community" pool of data.

To me the key thing is that the libraries using Alma can do whatever  
they want with records they have attached their holdings to -- they  
can make them available to anyone. (It is up to them to decide if they  
can share records in their private area.) This is the thing that they  
cannot do with OCLC records. Ex Libris is not claiming any rights in  
anything other than its own software.

Bulk downloads of the Library of Congress *Name* Authority File (NAF) are now available.  The current bulk download is only MADS/RDF.  We'll make a SKOS/RDF download available in the near future.  We are offering two serializations:  n-triples and RDF/XML.

The LC *Subject* Heading (LCSH) file continues to be available for download as SKOS/RDF, but now LCSH is also available in MADS/RDF (in the same serializations).  The MADS/RDF enables the identification of types for subject headings and subheadings.  

They may be downloaded here:  http://id.loc.gov/download/

The data dumps are very much a work in progress. Please report problems, issues, and wishes on the ID.LOC.GOV listserv:

Hi Peter,

there is http://pmretract.heroku.com/journals that pulls retraction
information from PubMed. I am CCing Neil who coded that and may have
some insights as to how to implement your suggestion.

Hi Kevin,

This is really great to see - and I've added a data package on
<http://theDataHub.org> for this:

<http://thedatahub.org/package/library-of-congress-name-authority-file>

One question. What is the exact license under which this data is
released? I was presuming 'Public Domain' given this statement on the
about page:

<quote>
The Library of Congress has prepared this vocabulary terminology
system and is making it available as a public domain data set. While
it has attempted to minimize inaccuracies and defects in the data and
services furnished, THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS IS PROVIDING THIS DATA AND
THESE SERVICES "AS IS" AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

Message-ID: <CAJ9UX4508kvEb5AEzXRuJOT82RkcP8MMBMAONsv9XMnoktzSnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello open biblio people,

I would like to suggest some more regular meetings for the working
group. Perhaps every two weeks. These could be open to anyone wishing
to join in.

Adrian already usually organises meetings on the first Tuesday of
every month - would it be worth having another meeting that week over
and above that? Or should we just add another say in the middle of
each month? What would people prefer?

Perhaps a meeting this week to discuss would be useful for those
interested? If so I propose we talk on Wednesday 17th August at 1600
UK time (currently GMT + 1).

Please let us know if what you think of this idea, and let me know if
you want to attend on Wednesday, and I will initiate a call then.

Hi Mark,

So far, I've participated only in a few of the meetings ... and those
at the kick-off. If the meeting schedule happens to be when I'm
available and on a topic of
special interest I'll join in future. But in any case, it has been
useful to be able to look at meeting notes/minutes etc to track
developments, so I'm hoping that will continue.

best,

Micah

I think we should distinguish general working group meeting (monthly)
and some 'dev' meetings which could occur more frequently e.g. every 2
weeks.

I'd suggest not. Rather, I'd propose a 30m 'dev' meeting either before
or after that main meeting. One can then run one other dev meeting in
the month 2-weeks offset from the main meeting.

I'll aim to make this.

Hi Micah,

Sure, we will keep putting up meeting notes and you are free to join
any time it suits you!

In order to make this easier, I will put up an etherpad before each
meeting to list some relevant topics.

DC-2011 Pre-conference Session: "Vocabulary Management and Alignment"

PLACE: National Library of the Netherlands, The Hague
REGISTRATION:

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We are writing to invite you to participate in a Dublin Core special session
being planned for DC-2011 at The Hague.[1] The day-long pre-conference
special session is intended as a forum for managers of structured data
vocabularies as well as researches and practitioners working on metadata
management and controlled vocabularies.[2] The session will be focused on
the shared needs for vocabulary management infrastructure, the policy issues
surrounding vocabulary management, and the possibility of mapping between
vocabularies. The topics listed are only suggestions--attendees will be able
to influence the direction of discussion. A poll will be circulated to
registrants prior to the meeting to gather additional background information
and help set the agenda.

At DC-2010, Mike Bergman's keynote address strongly suggested that DCMI has
a potential role in promoting co-operation among vocabulary managers and in
providing best practices for vocabulary alignment and interoperability. The
inevitable and useful proliferation of vocabularies emerging in the linked
data space demonstrates a need for increased vocabulary reuse and tools to
facilitate this reuse, as well as central reference vocabularies and tools
to manage and encourage vocabulary mapping. The purpose of this day-long
special session at DC-2011 is to explore the issues identified by Bergman
among others and DCMI's potential role in supporting vocabulary alignment,
interoperability and preservation across the metadata ecosystem.

If travel is not an option for any of you, remote participation may be
possible through IRC. Please note that early-bird registration ends on 5
September.

We very much hope some or all of you may be able to attend what we expect to
be a very useful event.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

We are writing to invite you to participate in Dublin Core tutorials planned
for DC-2011 at The Hague. Registration for the pre-conference includes all
four tutorials.  The topics of the tutorials range from an introduction to
Dublin Core through migration of an XML/HTML encoded Dublin Core metadata
application to a linked data version. The following four tutorials are
programmed:

TUTORIAL TITLE: An Introduction to Dublin Core
PRESENTER: Stephanie Taylor
ABSTRACT: This tutorial will provide a basic introduction to the Dublin Core
(DC) metadata set, starting with a brief overview of how and why DC began
and how it has developed to the present day. Simple DC and Qualified DC will
be explained, with practical examples of real-life usage to illustrate the
application of DC in different working environments. The tutorial will have
a 'hands on' approach, giving participants an opportunity to explore the
elements through group work and to use both Simple and Qualified DC to
describe objects.

TUTORIAL TITLE: Even More Dublin Core
PRESENTER: Emma Tonkin
ABSTRACT: Dublin Core, like many things in life, is many things to many
people. This tutorial starts by taking a quick tour through the conceptual
landscape of the DCMI. We then move on to practical exploration,
demonstrating the role of Dublin Core as a helpful Swiss Army knife in a
well-stocked metadata toolbox. Using the vocabularies, schemas, concepts and
processes behind Dublin Core?such as the Singapore Framework, we work
through practical examples of: describing a set of resources; developing an
application profile for a given purpose; building metadata records on the
basis of a newly constructed application profile; and marking up web-based
data with microformats. Finally, the tutorial takes a look at how Dublin
Core fits in with the world of Linked Data.

TUTORIAL TITLE: SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System)
PRESENTER: Antoine Isaac
ABSTRACT: SKOS is a data model to represent and network knowledge
organization systems (thesauri, classification systems, etc) in RDF. SKOS is
meant to be as easy of use as possible, fitting existing practices while
keeping general enough to fit a high number of use cases and KOS
configurations. In this tutorial, an introduction to the various features of
SKOS will be given, illustrating how they can be used to represent existing
KOS data. The tutorial will present how the vision of leveraging existing
KOS on the web of data is being adopted in a number of projects, in the
Cultural Heritage sector and beyond. Available tooling and methods for
creating and publishing SKOS as well as porting legacy KOS data to SKOS will
also be discussed.

TUTORIAL TITLE: From Dublin Core to Linked Data
PRESENTER: Paul Hermans
ABSTRACT: In this tutorial we will learn in a concrete way how to migrate an
XML/HTML encoded Dublin Core metadata application to a linked data version
hereof. We cover all the needed steps to:
define the identifiers (URI's) of the resources choose the right models,
vocabularies generate links to different datasets convert to the needed
representations (RDF/XML, turtle, HTML) and publish the data as
dereferenceable linked data. We will also address also some FAQ's: reusing
vocabularies or building your own, SKOS (concepts) or OWL (classes), how to
model temporal constraints, how to apply closed world constraints. In
closing, we give an overview of the tools and technologies which can be
used.

We very much hope some or all of you may be able to attend what we expect to
be a very useful event.
