  I read the entire paper. It is certainly an ambitious project.

  Since you need data, you could start with the set in 3lib.org.
  The current set on the web site is not complete because of 
  disk space problems I have mentioned previously. But I can
  give you access to the accounnt that produces the data and
  you can rsync the data and the scripts that transform it.

  Can you make the data freely available in bulk, say on an oai-pmh
  repository, or an ftp site, for others to use in search engines or
  other value-added services hat they may build?

  I think we should because there are other people that may start to
  work with this. We need a re-usable base of bibliographic data that
  is shared so we can build services on top of that data understand
  each other. So when, say, AuthorClaim says that user X has
  disclaimed document D, that information is reusable.  Or when k4all
  say that D has been access 200 times in November, that information
  is reusable. AuthorClaim can report this to user X.

  This is how RePEc works. I started this in 1993, and it's been quite
  successful.

> How much disk space do you need? Depending on what your requirements

  There are two parts to this.

  The first is the 3lib dataset as used in AuthorClaim and
  AuthorProfile.  This only contains titles, authors and
  URLs. Recently, on the source machine

krichel at wotan:~$ du -s /home/mamf/opt/amf/3lib/
42022232        /home/mamf/opt/amf/3lib/

  This data is free because it is factual. I think the HAL data also
  has abstracts and for selected sources we may start adding
  abstract. Call that the AMF data.

  Then, there are other parts of the data that are sources of the AMF
  data, and scripts used to transform the data from source to AMF. Off
  the top of my head, this includes PubMed that I can't redistribute
  for licensing reasons. There is CrossRef data the status of which is
  also dodgy. 

  For the OKFN machine, I export all that is in the home of  mamf

mamf at wotan:~$ crontab -l | grep sofca
53 22  * * * rsync -aq --delete --delete-during --exclude-from ~/etc/sofca.exclude ~/ flib at sofca:opt/wotan/home/mamf

  except

mamf at wotan:~$ cat etc/sofca.exclude
*~
# .ssh
_darcs
# data
# lib
public_html
# usr
var
# Mail
medlease
medleasebaseline
opt/spires
opt/tmp
opt/amf/ap
var/log
base
base_norm
base_org

  I can try to make that list longer, but I would also have to change
  the 3lib.org documentation.

  I can't go through all of this now, it's a big body of work. I will
  have quite a bit of time to work on this from mid January to
  September next year. Right now I am maintaining stuff.

  I suggest you get the AMF data soon, it will give you something to
  play with. As your business plan says, you want some data that is
  essentially cc0. The AMF set is not necessarily de jure CC0, but
  de facto it is. 

  Send me a public key to authorize.

Hi everyone,

Slightly belated introduction as some of you have already met me on Skype,
in Cambridge or in the London office, but hello anyway! I joined the
community team last week and am very happy to be on board with such a great
group of people. I just spent the weekend at the Mozilla Festival where I
was unsuspectingly pictured with my colleagues alongside a couple of foxes
http://instagr.am/p/Ssu8d/.

I studied philosophy and history at university, and hope that I can bring
my passion for these two subjects into some of my work at the OKF. I'll be
focusing my work on supporting cultural heritage and public domain related
projects, and trying to get the proposed Open Philosophy
project<http://jonathangray.org/2011/11/04/ideas-for-openphilosophy-org/>off
the ground. I will also be helping to streamline the various OKF
blogs,
generating interest and debate around the Ideas
Incubator<http://ideas.okfn.org/>and, in the next couple of weeks, I
will begin running the weekly OKF
hangout sessions - so come and say hi if you come down to them!

I really look forward to working with you all,

Sam

Hello,

last week the German KIM-DINI working group published recommendations
for libraries and related institutions on releasing open data. Besides
descriptive metadata which is already covered in other documents also
non-sensitive data produced by libraries and related institutions is
subject of the recommendations, e.g. statistical data or circulation
data. Furthermore, the recommendations don?t only cover open licensing
but also open access, open standards and the documentation,
sustainability as well as other apsects of open data.

To read more about it and my first first stab at an English
translation see
