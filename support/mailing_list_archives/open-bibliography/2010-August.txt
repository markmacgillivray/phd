Interesting post from John! ;-)

"In an earlier post, I discussed how I was using the open data from
the Library of Congress? Authorities and Vocabularies service to
enhance subject browsing on The Online Books Page.  More recently,
I?ve used the same data to make my subjects more consistent and up to
date.  In this post, I?ll describe why I need to do this, and why
doing it isn?t as hard as I feared that it might be."

Wonder if there's any scope here for doing something on open
bibliographic metadata?

Hi all,

today being the first Tuesday of the month, our virtual meeting will be held
at 16:00 UK time. We'll meet on the #okfn channel on irc.oftc.net.

Since Adrian is on holiday, he hasn't put up an agenda. Please feel free to
add topics that you think should be discussed to
http://okfnpad.org/wTnZOOxiRz .

Cheers,
Felix

I'd be excited if we could mirror Mendeley's approach for scientific
metadata. Could we create a client like M's that would record the metadata
of a book and allow users to share their mdata and experience? I think M's
client would work well in this area  and would avoid rewriting anything.

We have to have an SME and I think this makes sense?

Building upon an existing model like Mendeley's certainly sounds
interesting... I wonder if they have the capacity to get involved in a move
toward monographs?

	introduction of myself)
Message-ID: <E572C4E24A021E409A013F2FA1A3B6A2055A7518@MAIL-01.kb.local>

Dear everyone,

 

I have been lurking on this list since the beginning, and think it is time I introduced myself to the list. I work at the National Library of Sweden with coordination of development regarding the Swedish LIBRIS union catalog/search service/bibliographic infrastructure, etc. I was involved with publishing LIBRIS as linked data a few years ago and I have probably met many participants on this list at different library conferences. My main interest in open bibliographic data comes from thinking  that it is the best way to achieve a bibliographic infrastructure that maximises usability, promotes innovation, and is long-term sustainable. If possible, I'd like to be added as a member of the (already quite large) working group. 

 

Next week I will give a presentation on "Why Open Access to Bibliographic Metadata Matters, for Libraries and for the World" at the IFLA Satellite Meeting on "Open Access and the Changing Role of Libraries". (http://www.kb.se/aktuellt/utbildningar/2010/Open-Access-and-the-Changing-Role-of-Libraries/) I will also give short presentations on "LIBRIS and Open Data" at something called the Speakers Corner in the conference venue. The Speakers Corner will be located in something called "the library lounge" - a place where the IFLA delegates can relax, recharge their laptops etc. I am not sure how many people will actually be interested in the presentations at the Speakers Corner, but this morning I realized that it would be perfect to have a print flyer on open data. 

 

In May there was discussion on this list regarding an Open Bibliographic Data Flyer. The work seem to have continued during the virtual meeting on july 6th. Has this flyer been finished? The text is very good, but obviously it needs some editing and lay-out before it can be printed. I probably will not have time to do this before next week, but if this has already been done by someone else I would be happy do distribute such papers during IFLA.

 

I have seen that Patrick Danowski will give a presentation on open bibliographic data at .If there are more people from this list going to Gothenburg next week, I suggest some kind of meet up. 

 

Best regards

Anders S?derb?ck

Hello Anders,

sorry you get that late an answer but I was on vacation. It's great to
know you already are on this list. As I've heard about your talk in
Gotheburg I already thought that I have to invite you soon...

Concerning the flyers: As far as I know, no flyers have been printed
yet. We are working on a German version on the flyer and as soon as we
are done with it we will post it to the list so that layout/logo may be
reused.

Feel free to add yourself to the working group member list at
http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography 

Cheers,
Adrian

distributed more easily than a wiki page (read: PDF). Now that I'm  
about ready to do that, I no longer have the link to the flyer page. I  
hunted around the wiki, is this it?

If so, I'll try to make a nice flyer out of it.

p.s. Do we have a logo or any other graphic that is associated with the group?

Many thanks Karen. Could you manage to work in something about #jiscopenbib
which was funded and started after the flier?

Sure, I'll grab something from the blog. However, if we do a flyer, it  
will be hard to keep it up to date.... it might be best to stick with  
general principles, and pointers to more details?

Also, I was thinking of doing it in Adobe CS, which would make it less  
editable by others. I could try instead to do something in Word or  
Open Office (although it is hard to be elegant in the latter), with  
output in PDF. What do folks prefer?

Subject: [open-bibliography] Participate in the DC-Provenance task group
Message-ID: <4C641D3A.4030608@bib.uni-mannheim.de>

Apologies for cross-posting.

Hi all,

the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) has recently started a task
group to address the issue of ?metadata provenance?.

The group aims at creating a shared model of the data elements required
(a so-called ?application profile?) to satisfactorily describe an
aggregation of metadata statements in order to collectively import,
access, use and publish facts about the quality, rights, timeliness,
data source type, trust situation, etc. of the described metadata.

Thus, we will not be concerned with the general issue of provenance
metadata, but only with the provenance (in the broad sense of additional
information) *of* metadata. In essence, we are dealing with metametadata.

We are currently seeking participants from communities who would be
interested in working collaboratively on this DCMI initiative. More
information can be found in the group wiki:
http://wiki.bib.uni-mannheim.de/dc-provenance/

We expect that the results of the task group will have an impact on
several currently debated issues, e.g. best practices for publishing
library metadata as linked data.

So get involved and join us if you are interested in metadata
provenance, together we can work on this relevant topic. The broader the
participation of the community, the more useful the resulting
application profile and best-practice recommendations are going to be.
There will be punch an? pie ;-)

 Oxford: semantic web technologies applied to research data management
Message-ID: <4C694E95.2000406@zoo.ox.ac.uk>

  Dear Colleagues,

Two JISC-funded computing officer positions are available in my research 
group from 1st October, involving the application of semantic web 
technologies to the management of research datasets linked to journal 
articles.  These technically complex high-profile projects, related to 
our other JISC Open Citations project, will prove both challenging and 
stimulating. Copies of the adverts and further particulars are at 
http://imageweb.zoo.ox.ac.uk/pub/2010/Job%20opportunities/.  The closing 
date for receipt of applications is *Wednesday 15 September* *2010*.

	resources?
Message-ID: <8C843B21-34BF-461C-8029-E6EEBDD0ECA1@umich.edu>

All,
Of course I can think of a bucket-load of reasons why this would be impossibly hard to assemble and maintain, but I'm still curious:  has any organization tried to create a database of essentially "open" bibliographic resources?  In this case, I'm interested in something broad enough to include CC, PD, etc.--i.e., resources that can be used (at least in scholarship and teaching) without fees paid to the maintainer of the resource?

If I'm understanding you correctly, this is *exactly* what CKAN is for:

  http://ckan.net/
  http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic

CKAN is an open source registry of open data/open content 'packages'
(as in software packages). Medium to long term idea is something like
apt-get for open data, with support for automating lots of stuff.

Focus is on material that is open as in opendefinition.org (of which
PD material and *some* CC licensed content is a subset).

Does that help? Would love to have any feedback on how we can improve
CKAN for bibliographic material.

All the best,

Jonathan

No, but it's my fault:  too terse.  CKAN is a registry of data (including metadata) sources, but I'm wondering about the metadata themselves.  That is, is there a searchable bibliographic database of these materials such that a faculty member could locate, say, free-free articles on adhesion in polymer blends?

I may be wrong but I think John is looking for something rather
different: the equivalent of what gets called a 'knowledge base' in
proprietary applications like SFX, which would provide the ability to do
bibliographic searches across open access and public domain databases.
It's something I had been wondering about trying to create too, though
at the moment it's just a rather vague idea.. As John implies, it would
be a big job - not just to create but to keep up-to-date.

I find CKAN pretty impenetrable. I have no idea what I am expected to do 
to contribute to that page or how to put it to use.

We have been considering the idea of data.eprints.org to build a SPARQL 
endpoint for all sites running EPrints. Blue sky, right now, as there's 
only 3 sites running an up-to-date enough EPrints to have RDF data.

As sites upgrade to 3.2 over the next year this will proliferate, so if 
there's any critical bits of data people wish we'd included, now's the 
time to shout!

[slightly off topic -- but cc'ing to list for posterity!]

Uh oh! Sounds like we aren't doing something right! Thanks for letting
us know! ;-)

Chris: I know its a pain, but would you mind sitting down with someone
on our end and going through some of the things you find problematic /
difficult to understand with CKAN, so we can try to address them and
make it more usable?

Can either contact me or Friedrich (in cc) or ping our public CKAN discuss list:

http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/ckan-discuss

We've also just discussed having better feedback mechanism so its
easier for people to say what they find difficult / non-obvious
(anticipate that some of this could be addressed in FAQ, linked to
from relevant places...).

I know it's *terribly* old fashioned... and I hate to sound like a
broken 8 track... but index data still maintain an amazing registry of
all the openly searchable bibliographic databases using IRSpy at
http://irspy.indexdata.com/. The data is open in the sense that anyone
can search it, and if I recall, it provides you an interface that
proxies for the collections in the database, allowing you to search
many of them at once. there are trendy restful and nasty old  (And yet
still everso efficient) ASN.1/BER APIs. There are still a lot of these
"Old world" open datasets out there, that we're often quick to forget
about. I wonder if we shouldn't find a way to get them into CKAN
(Z3950 URL's and all).

The trouble with the old Z3950 API's in the brave new world is that
it's a search/retrieve protocol, rather than a distribution protocol
like OAI, so it's not that easy to take copies of the data. An
interesting side question... And one that I'm suddenly excited by
again.. is to ponder if it's possible to write an adapter that can
turn a z3950 target into a discrete set of data files with updates or
an even OAI feed. Sadly, not many Z targets support modified stamps or
even stable record identifiers.. But still..

Has anyone played with: http://zmarco.sourceforge.net/

"... Essentially ZMARCO allows MARC records which are available through
a Z39.50 server to relatively easily be made available via the OAI-PMH."

I can second OAISter as a tool to let people search over the known open
access repositories, but getting a copy of the data it holds is more
murky.

Chris, I can't remember if I've already asked this before, but is the
ROAR dataset available for download somewhere?

At Jisc we have two registries that are related to this idea, the Information Environment Service Registry at MIMAS, and OpenDoar run at the University of Nottingham.

We're currently looking at the scope of these into the future, and the way any ideas, data and lessons from our investments and work so far should be taken forward in the current environment.

Currently unable to send URLs but they should be easy enough to find.

Going back to the original question, OAIster doesn't contain all "open"
data.  Lots of records in OAIster (as well as what could be harvested via
ROAR and OpenDOAR) are not for freely available resources.  It's also
impossible to figure out what is free/not-free from the results.

That's not to say that any of these aren't good starting points, esp. if
some degree of error is okay, but they can be very frustrating to rely on if
you're expecting the content to be open access.

The way that OAIster misses is pretty much a characteristic of its design.  FWIW, I was the PI in the original proposal/award.  What we sought to do was capture academically-oriented resources that were identified through OAI feeds.  At the time we thought of OAI as the mechanism that would help compensate for the failure of the big search engines to pick up our resources (i.e., our stuff wasn't in the open web).  Consequently, a real measure of success would have been that the things that made their way into OAIster were *not* in the open web.  As it turned out, we got both things that were in the open web and things that were not, and we got things that were openly accessible and things that were restricted.  It didn't set out to be an index to "open" resources and so its failure is, I hope, forgivable ;)

which isn't really open at all in a useful way for Open Knowledge IMO.
It might only be "look but don't touch".  From what I remember, MARC21
doesn't contain a tag that specifies the licensing terms of a record,
does it?

If I've forgotten/overlooked it, can we build something on top of
index data's registry to search/show which terms have been found in a
database?

I had not realised till I started this Open Bibliography project
#jiscopenbib how awful and confused the state of serials (journals)
biblilography was. I am appalled and angry about the way that academia has
handed over its property for serials bibliography - or allowed it to be
stolen.

Unless I am wrong, there is no open bibliographic data for serials other
than that associated with Open Access publications. Open Access is itself a
poor formal definition and only recently have people started using Gratis
and LIbre to qualify it. So unless something is OA Libre then there is no
gurantee that the metadata or the bibliography is Libre - just Gratis at the
whim of providers. (There may be soemthign additional that PMC or UKPMC
add).

I did not realise that publishers sold their bibliographic metadata to
secondary publishers. That means that when I write a paper, the journal
sends off the metadata to some third party who protects with licences,
paywalls, but mainly FUD. And sells my metadata which I created back to my
employer

The whole system is paralyzed by FUD. You can only do anything with
non-Libre information except after negotation.
</RANT>

Anger is not the best rational emotion so I'll calm down

It needn't be like this. When I create an article I own my own name. I own
the title of the article. I own the right to mention the name of the
institution I am employed by.

I regard the name of the journal I send the article to as in the public
domain. If I write a letter to the Guardian I don't have to get their
permission to use the word "Guardian". So why should the Journal of
Extortionate Prices own the metadata of the artcile *I* wrote. Or to sell it
on to third parties in a restrictive manner? So that I can't use my own
material without permission.

Perhaps because the publisher has obtained a unique identifier? Or because
they have added page numbers? I don't know. It's as if the DVLC sued me for
publishing the license plate on my car.

There are lots of things that can be done. Openstreet map got 250,000
volunteers to map street names onto an open map. They did this by cycling
and walking the globe. Took 3-5 years. Compared with this it's trivial.

Simple solution:
* get every first year student to compile a bibliography of their subject by
hand. Portion out the work just like OSM does. A list of all journals and
all articles which students use to find new ones. How many papers published
per year? perhaps 5 million (I guess it's less) how many universities. Let's
take a low estimate of 1000. That's 5000 papers per university. That's a
trivial amount to produce. it's 100 papers per week. Per university.

It's legal. It's simple. It could be done by a mixture of carrot and stick.
Prizes for those who do the most. It's educational (well at least at the
start). It's legal.

So why not? Because the academic system cannot get its act together. Ask
most librarians and they'll tut-tut - not high-enough quality, not legal
enough (of course it's legal - you don't need permission of secondary
publishers to cite papers in your thesis).

If the universities did it, they would be unstoppable. Even 100 universities
(perhaps 1% of all universities) did it it would work.

But I have tried this with trying to get the Universities to provide
bibliography and metadata for their own theses. They seem incapable of
joining this up.

So - who is going to front this?
* universities?
* JISC?
* or the OKF.

I'm not mad. There are enough examples of citizen action that shows this is
completely tractable.

And of course we'd produce a better product. Because we understand what we
want. Conventional publishesr give people what can be sold. And that sale
has to include restrictions on use, because that increases monopolistic
dominance.

And I have some exciting ideas about better products

P.

Citations are more difficult. There are more, and they are trickier to
identify.

This is what the BKN project is about: providing tools to capture that  
serials bibliography:
   http://www.bibkn.org/

I assume Jim Pitman is on vacation or he probably would have answered  
this himself. They have grant money to further the work, you should  
probably contact him via the web site.

Thanks Karen for the pointer and prompt.
I have been offline a few days and only just read Peter's post. Of course, it was precisely
his sentiments exactly which motiviated the BKN project. We've been trying, but its been a struggle, and
our proposals for grant renewal were denied by NSF. Elements of these proposals could easily be recycled into
other potentially more successful efforts. We have some limited funding left, and I expect to
get continuing trickles from various sources. But I am a professional mathematician not a professional librarian or software developer. 
I'd rather spend my time doing math research (or even math biblio research) than biblio infra development. So I'd love to see someone more mainstream in the 
library community pick up this theme with some spurring which the likes of Peter and myself could gladly provide. 
Moral/legal support and provision of a fiscal shell for coordination of activities by a non-profit like OKFN would help.
I think I've learned some lessons from how difficult it has been to make progress in this area.
I'll collect my thoughts on potential strategies, of which there are many, and be glad to share with this group
if there is suitable encouragement.
Anyone interested in contributing to this effort, please contact me directly, and if there is enough interest maybe Jonathan you could
organize a suitable communication forum beneath OKFN?
many thanks

  The BKN project has also sponsored http://3lib.org, which is a side
  project to collect those sources that are already there, such as
  CiteSeer, DBLP, PubMed, RePEc etc. The main function of that dataset
  is to feed AuthorClaim at http://authorclaim.org. In the summer I
  have been working on a robot to extract CrossRef data from
  AuthorClaim profiles. It's not released yet. Work on these unfunded
  activities is slow but it is not affected by funding uncertainties.
  I have been working on these issues for many years within the RePEc
  project. 

  Help would certainly be welcome. I am particularly interested in
  separate initiatives run by others with the prospect of exchanging
  data. I understand that the JISC openbib project has some serials
  data but my question here to know when this will be available has 
  gone unanswered.

  Cheers,

Yes. I hope we can get enough people interested. There are a few librarians
like Harvard who occasionally put their heads over the parapet and say "we
mandateX be Open" - and then they disappear. It's actually trivial (and
completely safe) for librarians to start working in this area. They won't go
to jail. If the universities are sued - and they probably will be for
challenging monopolies - the cases can be defended.

It's a pity I didn't know to look you up when I was in Berkeley last month
for the Open Science Summit.

How do we get through to librarians? Because they have the network and the
resources and the implicit power to solve this in months. I've tried
everything. I've cajoled, built systems, ranted, etc. The normal response is
total apathy. I am particularly appalled by those who say that they can't do
anything. And then there is a small fringe who attack me.

There is all this money going into Institutional repositories. That's
potentially an ideal place to work for collecting bibliography. Do they have
a bibliography of the stuff they've got in there? The academics own papers?
They SHOULD have. I bet most of them haven't. My grants are topsliced to pay
for libraries.I'd like to see some public return.

But I will be castigated for attacking libraries.

We *can* do it without libraries. It's much more work. It'll be messy.

But I am continuing with this. The Green Chain Reaction is mainstream.

  I beg to differ. Librarians usually lack the required technical
  skills. They often contract them out. That's when things get
  expensive.

for showing terms, Z3950 has a pretty commonly implemented feature
called scan that can be used to iterate over the terms found in an
index, listing frequency too, which can be useful for planning and
optimising large scale distributed queries (If you're really into that
kind of thing). Not sure that the data is public from the irspy site,
but it's easy to grab the source and hack it around.

AFAIK (I'm not a marc expert by a way) you're right that there's no
obvious way to discern the license for a record (Or indeed the license
for the resource pointed to by the record). Of course the tech
predates that particular question. It's kinda sad that the sheer
weight of this legacy resource seems to prohibit going back and
"Fixing" the absence of any license fields. TBH I think the lack of a
consistent unique identifier is more of a problem for a generic
solution. If there were a consistent unique identifier, we could
always just stick the license statements in an ancillary store and
look up the details after we've retrieved the bib data (Heck, some of
those old timer coders might even be able to mash-up servers that
present a unified view). I guess coding such solutions on a
case-by-case basis is OK tho. Come to think of it, a useful feature of
a Z3950->OAI tool might be to add such license statements.

Cheers,
Ian.

I'm no MARC expert either, but I've spent years wading in it to
achieve migrations to Koha and so on.  I think 018$a (Copyright
article-fee code) would at least allow to spot fee-required
resources pointed to by records.

I guess we might be able to combine the 008/39 and 040 (Cataloging
Source) values with external knowledge of the catalogue licensing
policies of various agencies to figure things out, but it's imperfect.

Really?  I thought copyright had been obnoxious for quite a while.

Although I saw it first, I'm less familiar with OAI.  What would I
expect to see for open bibliographic data in OAI?  Does it happen
in the wild?

YES! This was partly why I was interested in starting Bibliographica.
A few key points on this:

  * To make something that is used you can't just give people a form
and expect them to add a thousand articles. There must be some
incentive for users in order to make this really scale. E.g. being
able to use it to generate nice indexes for courses they teach/attend,
books they write, having a community to help ensure the information is
up to date, all open so can be plugged into other
tools/services/resources, and so on.
  * Hence Bibliographica, which aims to be a free, open source,
scalable service which you can import/export from, set up your own
instance of (like Wordpress), and do lots of neat things with.
  * I think it is reasonable to assume that the people who know the
publications in a given area best are the researchers who work in that
area. ;-)
  * Relevant articles don't always come from the same bunch of
journals. E.g. in my area (philosophy / intellectual history), I also
need to search literature, theology and other areas -- not to mention
articles in different languages. IMO, subscription based services can
only take you so far in this respect, especially in the humanities.
Basically I would suggest it could be natural to pull in data to
different 'instances' run by different groups of users for different
purposes. The Cambridge University History Undergraduate instance, the
Charles Dickens instance, the 19th century fiction instance, etc.
  * Subscription resources can be *expensive*. E.g. my institution
does not subscribe to the Philosopher's Index due to the expense. It
is pretty pricey for individuals:

I'd like to propose a conference call on how OKF can collaborate with
BKN. I'll liaise with Jim and Peter to find a time and then report
here so others can join in if they want!

Peter,

It's interesting that you attack libraries for not doing anything; I think
they would be more than happy to be given reasonable suggestions.

Actually, libraries generally blame *academics* for the sorry state of
affairs in this arena:  they absolutely refuse to care about the license
agreements they sign off on to their intellectual output.  That being said,
there are no rights on the metadata itself.  That can be indexed anywhere,
it's just the content that has restrictions.

Plenty of universities have departments (in the library!) to help faculty
negotiate greener licenses or to submit pre/post prints to their
repositories, but you can only lead that horse to water.  Without some
faculty support, it's going to be tough for libraries (esp. non-research
libraries at larger universities) to keep up with all of the publications of
their faculty.

-Ross.

Also, my employer, Talis, has a non-free, non-open source, but open data
offering in this space:
http://www.talis.com/aspire/

(note, this is not a product pitch for Aspire, just want people to be aware
that the data that goes into it is open and RDF).

Here's an example:

http://resourcelists.ntu.ac.uk/lists/0FC5CDEF-D3AD-A8D9-B800-59ED80E1B3E3

And, you can get the RDF either through conneg or:

http://resourcelists.ntu.ac.uk/lists/0FC5CDEF-D3AD-A8D9-B800-59ED80E1B3E3.rdf

for the list.

http://resourcelists.ntu.ac.uk/items/F9FE3794-6EC8-4C98-1E0B-BA8071B54116.rdf

for reference to an item on a reading list (different from the thing
itself).
and:

http://resourcelists.ntu.ac.uk/resources/EC7FA3CB-20CC-94CD-36FB-002E8B655D18

for an individual item.

Anyway, potential source for more open bib data.

This is where I was going with the natural language
robot bit. If students or researchers could jot down
notes not so differently than they already do but with
a minimum of prescriptiveness about the shape of
their sentences, then you could just upload the text
file and out pops an annotated reading list all nicely
indexed and presented.

Not everyone agrees. If this is true then we can simply trawl the exposed

  ??? 

  An abstract is a piece of metadata copyrightable, afaik. If the
  publisher holds the copyright on the abstract, you can't use the
  abstract without their consent.

  Yes, and only publishers have such incentives. In RePEc we
  have beenn more succesful than anybody else, now aggregating
  contributions from over 1000 publishers.

Yes, no doubt that would be both politically savvy on the part of the

Do bibliographies generally include abstracts?

My understanding is "a service that runs only on
free software" so you can download the software
and run your own version of the service if you
like. The AGPL [0] tries to codify this in legal terms.

  The fact that the software is free is irrelevant if it's not
  available. Thus you need the service to be completely documented,
  meaning its maintenance scripts are available too. It's a tall order
  to maintain such a beast, and it can be difficult if it involves
  issues of user privacy.

  I believe that the Open Library Society's ARIW service at
  http://ariw.org is the only service that true conforms to this, but
  I would be interested in reading about others making similar claims.

> so you can download the software

  Well you would also need to get the data. For some data that is fine
  but for personal data this is tricky.

  I plan to think more about this issue in the fall.

Unfortunately the status of library catalogue records in terms of licensing remains a bit of a grey area - not least because it often isn't clear where records came from, what agreements were in place when they were obtained, and how much the record has changed since it was obtained. The fields MJ identifies may well help, but unlikely to tell the whole story.

I think also there is some FUD around this as well (I don't mean people/organisation deliberately doing this, more that those responsible may well be uncertain about what they can do with the records etc.) The following JISC guide may help http://www.jisclegal.ac.uk/Projects/TransferandUseofBibliographicRecords.aspx.

A note on this from a Librarian. Firstly I'd personally dispute the 
concepts of unified network,
resources and power on this scale that libraries have. To my mind, no 
single entity currently exists
  within Libraries of sufficient power or influence to push this through 
onto agendas, not in the Russell group,
not nationally or internationally.

I'd agree with the other comment that libraries have generally lacked 
in-house technical skills,
and have generally out-sourced and used commercial software, like many 
other areas of University activity (finance, student records etc).
This is slowly changing and there are some great open-source projects 
underway now, but either way there is an eventual cost to an institution 
(in techies or license fees).

So supporting a wide-scale open access bibliographic database of this 
nature would not be easy, in terms of cost of getting
the ball rolling creation and maintenance of data (mostly from scratch) 
and technical ability.

But it could happen nationally at least, and the recent SCONUL shared 
services report for academic libraries
indicated steps in thinking in this direction. There are also many 
advantages to back-office library work in having this data freely available.
However, were this to work in the fashion you seemingly indicated (down 
tools and record all articles we own then share them),
it would need time and resources that would have to be diverted away 
from current library services,
possibly those that people on this list may perceive as 'legacy', but 
may be of value to others.

Those in charge of libraries (often not necessarily Librarians) would 
question why staff time was being spent
  're-keying' data that has already been paid for. You would need to 
convince them that the data was as useful or more
so than the current subscription services (who are likely to sue us) in 
its open format. That would need a good high-level argument.
The eventual cost of operation vs the cost of A&I subscriptions (Web of 
Knowledge, Scopus etc.) is one here.

You would also need to convince them to let services stop or slide for a 
period whilst the data created from scratch.
This which would cause complaints, affect metrics, and thus funding.

Another note. Academic libraries are run as a reader-focused service 
with often very little freedom for
individuals to pursue personal projects, especially those with technical 
ability.
Library staff (not all of whom are Librarians) are really at the mercy 
of their managers as to how they spend their time.
Following individual interests over responsibilities is usually met with 
caution and sometimes official action.
This is part of the reason behind the Arcadia fellowship at Cambridge, 
to allow people the chance to pursue individual projects.

If this is the source of the 'apathy' you talk about, I don't personally 
think that's a fair term,
although I can understand the personal feeling behind it.

Not at all. In 10+ years in the job, I'm personally surprised no-one has 
shouted about more it loudly.
There are historical reasons. Traditionally (pre automation), article 
level metadata creation has never really been
done within academic libraries, certainly not in a whole-sale fashion. 
Its always been outsourced.
We have a history of print based abstract indexes from specialist 
organisations and groups
through to CD-ROMS and the current set of online databases. All supplied 
by commercial entities and
all subject to the increasingly nefarious changes in copyright 
legislation that accompanied them.

That is not to say this should continue to be the case. There has been 
work to compile and distribute
those datasets that are truly open, and Librarians *are* involved in 
this and their creation.
I'm sure Pubmed employs a lot of Librarians, although they may not be 
paid for by your top-slice :)

> We *can* do it without libraries. It's much more work. It'll be messy.


Were you to go down the crowdsourcing route, I'm would hope least a few 
Librarians would join in 'unofficially',
hopefully at a level greater than data entry. Many would struggle to see 
the need though.


Personally I feel it may actually be easier to convince the publishers 
to give the data up for free re-use,
especially if they can see it as a means to get sell more full text.

Do bibliographies generally include abstracts?

Here's a first one. Dont sign metatadata licensing agreements which forbid
anything other than "personal use" of the metadata. Literal reading of every licensing
agreement I've seen would forbid typically inclusion of data in any kind of bibliographic
aggregate even for sharing amongs members of the same institiution, let alone publication
of any form of bibliography based in the "licensed metadata".
Licensed metadata is an oxymoron.

Not true. The highest quality largest aggregations of metadata are all subject to 
licensing restrictions. Publishers and secondary indexing services also perpetuate the myth
of copyright in biblio metadata. There appears to be no copyright protection for individual biblio
records provided by US law, but selections, arrangements, databases is another matter. There might be
some copyright in a selection or arrangement, it is hard to tell, and for databases we enter some more 
difficult legal territory.

Right. But library IT support should be capable of maintaining simple tools such as Drupal/Open Scholar
http://scholar.harvard.edu/
for individual faculty members to maintain their own personal biblio data, cvs, and reference lists on subjects they care about, in 
structured ways that are readily curated and shared.
That would provide a big incentive for faculty participation.

That's not what the AGPL is about at all.  The only network connection
is that offering a network service using the AGPL software triggers
the same source disclosure requirements that distributing the software
does under earlier versions of the GPL.  It doesn't say anything at
all about how you provide your network service, whether it can depend
on other non-free software, or anything like that.

I really don't want to get sidetracked into a debate
about software licensing if it can be sensibly avoided.

But, open services are exactly the intended consequence
of using the AGPL. So if I build a service out of AGPL
software, I have to distribute the software so others
can do the same. I think it would be very unusual
for someone to make AGPL software that depended
on proprietary software but I might be wrong about
that.

Cheers,

There are a couple of flaws I see in this:

1) Libraries aren't always the ones signing the contract - there are lots of
consortial agreements, not to mention institutional counsels involved.
2) Let's say the library (and a smaller fish than Berkeley, let's say Sonoma
State, for the sake of argument) decides to take a principled stand on this
and subsequently loses access to Springer, Elsevier and Nature titles.  Do
you think the faculty will be satisfied with this moral victory?

I guess we need to define the limits of what we mean by metadata here.
 Title, author(s), journal title, date, page number, volume, issue, etc. are
not copyrightable, else citeulike or zotero groups couldn't exist.

What is the uptake of Harvard's tool?  Looking through the profiles, it
looks pretty limited.  Most libraries would be hesitant to take this on
until there was a strong commitment (read: requirement) from the departments
to actually contribute and maintain their lists.

The nice thing about building an infrastructure off of reading lists (and
their US counterpart, reserves lists) is that this actually *is* a part of a
lecturer/instructor/professor's job, so the incentive to maintain them is
there.

Building an aggregation service into a link resolver, like the Umlaut (
http://wiki.code4lib.org/index.php/Umlaut) would work, too - it's sort of
like Last.fm, if I had to go there and tell it what I listened to today, I'd
have as empty a profile as those Harvard scholar's pages.

We absolutely need some consensus on this. Some people say thatw e can
collect this metadata without restrictions - others say we can't. There is
no technical reason why we cannot extract the metadata automatically

Reading lists are only part of the use of bibliography. I suspect most
papers are not on any reading list, so reading lists will only tocuh a
minute fraction of the material. For example we are indexing 10,000 articles
from Acta Crystallographica and I doubt a single one is on any reading list.
Yest they are critical for data-driven science.

IMO for many sciences it is essentiall to have all the papers in their field
and if we rely on selections we shan't get the bullk of them.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimfcNZWJ0VaM1S_ohc+tvb1bWzThaUQ=vUB6u97@mail.gmail.com>

This is now announced:

  http://blog.okfn.org/2010/08/17/workshop-on-open-bibliographic-data-and-the-public-domain/

Registration is now open:

  http://publicdomain.eventbrite.com/

You can propose a session / topic / discussion / project here:

  http://okfnpad.org/pdobd

More info below...

= Workshop on the Open Bibliographic Data and the Public Domain =

== Details ==

  * Where: Rooms 108/108a, FU Berlin, Garystr. 21, 14195 Berlin
  * When: 7th October 2010
  * Register: http://publicdomain.eventbrite.com/
  * Tag: #pdobd
  * Notes: http://okfnpad.org/pdobd

== Overview ==

This one day workshop will focus on open bibliographic data and the
public domain. In particular it will address questions like:

  * What is the role of freely reusable metadata about works in
calculating which works are in the public domains in different
jurisdictions?
  * How can we use existing sources of open data to automate the
calculation of which works are in the public domain?
  * What data sharing policies in libraries and cultural heritage
institutions would support automated calculation of copyright status?
  * How can we connect databases of information about public domain
works with digital copies of public domain works from different
sources (Wikipedia, Europeana, Project Gutenberg, ...)?
  * How can we map existing sources of public domain works in
different countries/languages more effectively?

The day will be very much focused on productive discussion and
'getting things done' -- rather than presentations. Sessions will
include policy discussions about public domain calculation under the
auspices of Communia (a European thematic network on the digital
public domain), as well as hands on coding sessions run by the Open
Knowledge Foundation. The workshop is a satellite event to the The 3rd
Free Culture Research
Conference on 8-9th October: <http://wikis.fu-berlin.de/display/fcrc/Home>.

== Sessions ==

Some ideas for things to do (please add!):

  * Data sharing policies which will support automated calculation of
which works are in the public domain in different countries
  * To what extent can we do automated calculation of which works are
in the public domain based on readily available data sources?
  * Discussion / drafting for a 'manual' for opening up bibliographic data
  * Discussion of the role of bibliographic data to help determine
which works are in the public domain in which countries (to build
services like publicdomainworks.net)
  * Discussion / hacking on key technologies -- e.g. versioning for
data, RDF, data stores, user services, ...
  * Future of open bibliographic data -- what services people would
like to see (e.g. using data as backbone for new kinds of research
tools in digital humanities, representing data on maps/timelines)
  * Open bibliographic data / LOD
  * add things here! ;-)

Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that reading list management could be a
comprehensive way to accumulate all published materials.  What I wanted my
point to be (and obviously didn't make) was that the curation of these
bibliographies falls into the workflows of scholars.  Similarly, Mendeley
does this sort of functionality simply by /reading/ the articles (
http://www.mendeley.com/bibliography-maker-database-generator/), which fits
much better into my Last.fm analogy.

Mendeley's approach has its own share of problems/limitations, some of which
could be reduced by pushing its functionality to the link resolver (e.g.
Umlaut), although, that also would present new and different
problems/limitations.

I don't think any single method will provide a way to accumulate all
published resources, but the more that are in the general workflow of the
scholar the better (and more data that can come directly from the
publishers, the better).

-Ross.

Maybe (not sure how you determine other user's intentions), but it
doesn't actually *do* it.  It *can't* do it.  It covers only the software
running the service, not the data or anything.  This is acknowledged
in http://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html which says clearly:

  One problem which the GNU Affero GPL does not address is the problem
  of Software as a Service (SaaS). It is impossible, as far as we
  know, to address this problem with a software license. [END QUOTE]

This is why I'm unhappy if someone promotes the obnoxious Network
Interaction clause of the AGPL as needed for open services.  It's one
mostly-solved part of the problem and a bit of an expensive and clumsy
way to try to achieve open services.  It's a sidetrack and a big
distraction from open data and open access.

I feel http://www.opendefinition.org/ossd/ is a much more rounded
explanation and it's far easier to understand.

Hope that helps,

  A consensus reach here is of no use if it does not match
  legal reality.

  The way I see it (I have no formal legal education) is that, from a
  US perspective at least, a la Feist vs Rural Telephone, a compendium
  of factual data can not be copyrighted. The factual parts of a
  bibliographic descriptions are author name expressions, titles, and
  location information for full-text. Classfication data may or may
  not be considered as factual. Abstracts are definitely not.

  Fortunately, for author identification, we only need the
  factual components. These are the ones available at 3lib.org

  But there are economic reasons. It's expensive to maintain
  scraping when sites change.

  Again, when will this be available?

  Some do and some don't. DBLP for example has none, RePEc
  mostly has them.

  They should do some curation. An good example is NEP at
  http://nep.repec.org, a current awareness service for working
  papers in RePEc.

  But scholars should not create such records, since this would
  describe the same times many times over, and some items will
  not be described at all. Publishers should create such records
  and make them available freely.

Hallo,

I am not a lawyer but I've just started working with one on a guide for libraries about opening up catalog data. To consider the legal status of catalog data we have to distinguish the different types of data in a catalog as well as distinguishing between individual records and collections/databases.

So, what's in a catalog?

*  bibliographic data (That's the stuff that gets the most interest here),
* subject headings and notations,
* exemplar data (number of holdings, call number)
* metametadata (administrative metadata (last modified etc.) probably often created automatically).
* catalogue enrichment like:
   o links to wikipedia, google books, amazon etc.
   o Cover images (self-scanned or from amazon)
   o links to digitizations of tocs, registers, perhaps bibliographies (I don't understand why libraries didn't include the books' bibliographies in digitizing for catalogue enrichment)
   o abstracts
   o blurbs
   o reviews (user generated or by a lectorate service),
   o user generated tags.
          
Furthermore there are the authority records like:

    * name authority files
    * subject authority files
    * classifications (I put this to authority files though strictly speaking it might not be right)

Only three things of these you can have copyright individually on: abstracts, blurbs and cover images. These assumptions correspond to the practice in Germany and the contracts and agreements between library organizations and publishers.

So you can take individual records which don't contain copyrighted material without any legal risk. 

What about databases? 
Thomas already talked about American law from which European law differs by also protecting factual databases. The practice in libraryland seems to be to not copyright individual records. Even OCLC has abandoned the thought of copyrighting individual records (they first tried to). The policy now reads in 2. C (http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/recorduse/policy/default.htm#2C): "OCLC claims copyright rights in WorldCat as a compilation, it does not claim copyright ownership of individual records". (During the debate about OCLC's policy I asked  some questions on OCLC's "Online Community Forum" about whether individual members could publish their data under a Public Domain license. OCLC admitted that they would have the legal rights to do so but that the social contract of the policy is intended to prevent such actions. See http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/recorduse/policy/forum/forum.pdf.)

In European law there are two distinct but related rights associated with databases: copyright and the sui generis database right. So, even if you just collect facts and cannot claim any copyright on your database your "qualitatively and/or quantitatively substantial investment in either the obtaining, verification or presentation of the contents" is protected by not allowing the whole database or "substantial parts" to be copied and published by others. This "substantial part" bit is pretty vague and the one thing that is clear that more than half of a database represents a "substantial part" which doesn't mean that you are on the save side by taking less than half.

So, legally you can automatically collect metadata but obiously not without restrictions, at least according to European law. Most probably opening up a bigger part of OCLC's WorldCat would lead to being sued by them. (Additionally, if you've got a contract with a metadata provider, its terms might actually forbid the transmission of any one record to somebody else...)

Message-ID: <C8913A85.17506%annekz@umich.edu>

Apologies for cross-posting...

In response to the recent post announcing the upcoming Workshop on Open Bibliographic Data, we would like to make interested parties aware of efforts underway at the University of Michigan to identify works in the public domain in the HathiTrust Digital Repository ( http://www.hathitrust.org)).

We are currently halfway through a three year-long grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services to build a Copyright Review Management System ("CRMS") to identify works published in the United States from 1923-1963 that are in the public domain.  Staff at the University of Michigan have been reviewing volumes in the repository since 2007, and under the grant project we have formalized our efforts, instituted a "double-blind" review process, and built a database to store information about our determinations. We also recently trained staff at three other institutions, Indiana University, University of Minnesota, and University of Wisconsin, to join in our efforts.  At this point (including pre-CRMS) we have identified approximately 47,000 volumes in the repository that are in the public domain, and those works are now available as full-text in HathiTrust ( http://catalog.hathitrust.org/).

More information about the grant project is available here:

http://www.lib.umich.edu/copyright-review-management-system

We also make our rights determinations for all works in HathiTrust publicly available via tab delimited files. Among other data about the works in HathiTrust, these files include rights information for each volume, including the rights attribute (e.g., public domain, in-copyright, etc.) as well as the rights determination reason code (e.g., copyright not renewed, no copyright notice on the piece, etc.).

More information about HathiTrust Data Distribution & APIs and the HathiTrust Metadata is available here:

http://www.hathitrust.org/data
http://www.hathitrust.org/hathifiles_metadata

If anyone has specific questions on any of this please feel free to contact me directly.

Quoting Adrian Pohl <pohl at hbz-nrw.de>:


> "OCLC claims copyright rights in WorldCat as a compilation, it does   
> not claim copyright ownership of individual records".

Adrian, OCLC claims the rights, but that does not mean that OCLC *has*  
the rights. Anyone can claim rights in anything, but until it is  
settled via a legal procedure it is just a claim. So do not assume  
that this claim = legal rights. That is why the lawsuit between  
SkyRiver and OCLC is so interesting to some of us: it may be the first  
time that some of our assumptions are actually scrutinized in a court  
of law. I don't know if this particular issue will be part of that  
discussion, but many of us think that WorldCat's bibliographic data  
does not meet the minimum US legal requirements for copyright  
protection. (The key point of which is "creativity." A mere  
compilation of facts does not meet the creativity requirement.)  
WorldCat as a whole (database, UI, services) should be copyrightable,  
but the data itself, even the entire set of data, probably is not.

That's a very good summary Adrian.  I agree with Karen's caveat about
claimed versus actual rights, but people also shouldn't gloss over
that last parenthetical sentence:

>  (Additionally, if you've got a contract with a metadata provider, its terms might actually forbid the transmission of any one record to somebody else...)

It easily could hold the most meaningful restrictions on what can be
done with the data.  It is an excellent reason to review contracts and
license agreements carefully (although they really always should be
anyway).

That sounds like a great project!  I had a quick look and have a few
questions right off the bat:

- Is any machine assistance used to aid in the process of looking up
copyright renewals, etc or is this entirely a manual process?
- Is the bibliographic data which is available for retreival through
the API in the public domain?
- Is there an easy way to submit corrections (a la OpenLibrary) to the
bibliographic data?
  (As luck would have it, the very first record I pulled had a typo in
the publisher field http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005730998)
- Is any special handling being done for reprints in determining
copyright status?  For example,
http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005714794 is an 1896 book
republished in the 1980s with a new title page, but 99.99% of the book
is a photographic reproduction of the 1896 text (and presumably not
subject to copyright).

Thanks for doing this work to increase the pubic commons!

Of course you are right, Karen. Thanks for making this clear. I quoted
this part of the policy to underline the fact that there is no
copyright on individual records and I didn't want to state that OCLC
actually has a copyright on the database. I too think that it is quite
possible OCLC's claims wouldn't withstand in a trial.

The phrase "WorldCat as a whole" confuses me. I wouldn't say the whole
is copyrighted but certain components or aspects of it. E.g., there
most probably are property and related rights associated with the
technology behind WorldCat (which probably aren't owned by OCLC), the
logos and design and other things. But that doesn't sum up to WorldCat
as a whole being protected.

I probably said that wrong. You can claim copyright in a web site,  
which has design elements, some created content, etc. So, for example,  
the site of Amazon.com has a copyright notice ("? 1996-2010,  
Amazon.com, Inc. or its affiliates"), but that does not mean that  
Amazon claims to hold a copyright on every bit of data that appears on  
their pages. A newspaper can claim copyright in its web site but may  
not hold copyright in every article that displays. Copyright can cover  
design elements, look and feel, etc. In the cases of web sites I think  
it's often unclear what is being covered.

There is a similar copyright notice on the WorldCat home page:

  	Copyright ? 2001-2010 OCLC. All rights reserved.

What does this refer to exactly? I don't know. It links to a page that  
says simply (but not clearly):

"OCLC users are hereby granted permission to reproduce this  
publication for their internal use. Reproduction of substantial  
portions of this publication must contain the OCLC copyright notice."


I find it very confusing when OCLC refers to "WorldCat" in their  
documents because I'm not sure exactly how they are defining it.  
What's "this publication?" Sometimes they seem to mean the database,  
other times they seem to be mainly referring to the services. Is it an  
OPAC? A cataloging service? An ILL service? Where do they draw the line?

Message-ID: <8CB2A72BE4144B4CAC0EF3E9A9F6D0652DB4761858@AUR2010.aur.edu>

Additionally, with the WorldCat Rights and Responsibilities for the OCLC Cooperative (2 June 2010) at http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/recorduse/policy/default.htm,
they begin by stating:
"The purpose of the policy is to define the rights and responsibilities associated with the stewardship of the WorldCat  bibliographic and holdings database by and for the OCLC cooperative, *including the use and exchange of OCLC member-contributed data comprising that database*." (my emphasis-JW)

Later in the "Glossary" section, we find something even more interesting:
"WorldCat Data. For purposes of this policy, WorldCat data is metadata for an information object, generally in the form of *a record* [my emphasis-JW] or records encoded in MARC format, whose source is or at one point in time was the WorldCat bibliographic database.

You have received WorldCat data when (1) you have extracted it directly from the WorldCat database using one of OCLC's services for members (e.g., Connexion, WorldCat Cataloging Partners, CatExpress, the OCLC Z39.50 Cataloging Service, Batchload services) or under the terms of a non-member agreement with OCLC; or (2) you have extracted it from an online catalog or another source to which extracted WorldCat data has been transferred or made available.

Identifying WorldCat as the source of data that has been transferred or made available downstream of the initial extraction from WorldCat can sometimes be complex. A combination of the following data elements in a bibliographic record can help determine if the record was initially extracted from WorldCat:

    * An OCLC Control Number along with
          o the 001 field that includes value characters "ocm" or "ocn" and/or
          o the 035 field that includes the value "(OCoLC)" and/or
          o the 994 field"

I think all this must be read together. Even though your library is not, and has never been, an OCLC library, you may still be in possession of what is defined here as "WorldCat Data" and therefore subject to this policy. This also clearly includes single records. Although I am not a lawyer, from what I read here, it seems that once something has touched OCLC in any way at all, and no matter what you have done with it, OCLC claims ownership (i.e. that it is WorldCat Data) and that it falls under this policy. 

How this deals with, e.g. a record created by the Library of Congress, perhaps even as CIP (i.e. public domain), then being downloaded and updated by another library, finally, I would take this record directly from e.g. Yale, through Z39.50 and update it myself, according to this, this record would still fall under OCLC's policy. 

Would this hold up in court? Who knows? Although I am a fan of many of OCLC's projects and services, this seems to be overreaching to me. And as Karen points out, it could be that metadata, even including subject analysis and standardized headings, are considered to be facts and are not subject to copyright.

Tom - thank you for your interest in our work. Here are answers to your questions:

 - I would characterize this as a manual process. We have built automated querying tools into the system so a reviewer can search the Stanford Copyright Renewal Database without having to type in the title, etc. But it is up to the reviewer to then identify if the renewal records in the search results match the work they are examining, and if they don't find any renewal records it is up to them to do additional searching via truncation, etc.
 - HathiTrust is not the originator of any of the bibliographic data -  the rights or terms of use are determined by others.  In this case, records will often by constrained by the OCLC terms of use.  I'm new to this list, but I am told that in a separate email, Rufus reported on a conversation with John Wilkin about Michigan's ability to identify Michigan records that might be free of constraints, and that sort of dialogue would need to take place with each contributing institution.
 - You can send feedback about issues with the metadata in particular record or volume in the HathiTrust Catalog via the "Feedback" link at the top right of each record
 - Reprints that have been designated as in copyright based on date of republication are being evaluated as they come into our workflow, either via copyright review work, or if one is brought to our attention by a patron, usually via the HathiTrust feedback mechanism. We check to make sure the work is a true reprint (i.e. No new copyrighted material has been added to the original work) and if we can confirm that we will manually update the rights status). I did review the work that you cited and updated the rights status.

That sounds like a great project!  I had a quick look and have a few
questions right off the bat:

- Is any machine assistance used to aid in the process of looking up
copyright renewals, etc or is this entirely a manual process?
- Is the bibliographic data which is available for retreival through
the API in the public domain?
- Is there an easy way to submit corrections (a la OpenLibrary) to the
bibliographic data?
  (As luck would have it, the very first record I pulled had a typo in
the publisher field http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005730998)
- Is any special handling being done for reprints in determining
copyright status?  For example,
http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/005714794 is an 1896 book
republished in the 1980s with a new title page, but 99.99% of the book
is a photographic reproduction of the 1896 text (and presumably not
subject to copyright).

Thanks for doing this work to increase the pubic commons!

Thanks very much for the prompt response.  That's unfortunate about
the bibliographic records, but I guess OCLC's tentacles have a long
reach.

I'll certainly continue to follow the project with great interest.

Sure. The RDF export is a bit whacky as it's not been configured 
differently from a default eprints archive! I'm sure it could be cleaned 
up but I've not got time for another project! Perhaps if someone who 
cares created an example of a record, we could code that up quite 
easily, but I can't be hunting for or creating schemas for ANOTHER 
thing! *grin*

The repository URI & VoID is: http://roar.eprints.org/id/repository

But I suggest you'll get more useful data by going to the frontpage and 
doing export-as "EP3 XML" which will just dump the database in its 
native structure.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Using dcat for Open Bibliographic Data
Message-ID: <4C72B6F40200001400037632@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

Hello,
 
I have finally documented in English our experiences with the Data Catalog Vocabulary for describing open bibliographic data sets at https://wiki1.hbz-nrw.de/display/SEM/Using+dcat+for+Open+Bibliographic+Data. On this page you'll find some description examples, a documentation of our general problems and our specific problems with dcat as well as suggestions how to improve dcat.
 
These experiments were part of some thinking about the conceptualization of an open bibliographic data infrastructure. Felix and I published a paper on this some weeks ago, which unfortunately only exists in German, see http://www.hbz-nrw.de/dokumentencenter/produkte/lod/aktuell/pohl_ostrowski_2010_open-data-infrastruktur.pdf. For now our work on this will stop. As soon as more libraries publish their data under an open license we certainly will pick up these thoughts...
 
Cheers
Adrian

Hello,
 
I would be happy to bring the creation of Open Bibliographic Data Principles a bit further. In the group's first virtual meeting we discussed drafting an Open Bibliographic Data Charter. Quoting the meeting's minutes [1]:
 
<quote>
Background: See the proposal on the mailing list: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-June/000209.html 
This charter should be written short and simple. It should suggest a basic set of open data principles for library data. E.g. like Panton Principles (http://pantonprinciples.org/) ( http://pantonprinciples.org/%29 ). Could also aim to get sign on/support from key people in libraries, archives, etc.

See also: http://wiki.okfn.org/FutureOfBibliographicControl" 
</quote>

In the last meeting - which I didn't attend - some more thoughts were spent on this charter, see [2]. Though I think there are some valuable thoughts expressed I would like to stick to the KISS principle ("Keep it short and simple.") for the open bibliographic data principles. I started an Etherpad with a slight variation of the Panton Principles for Bibliographic Data at http://okfnpad.org/openbibliography-principles 
 
I believe - apart from the science specific introduction -  the Panton Principles in most parts perfectly also apply to bibliographic data. So I put together a draft introduction specific to bibliographic data (taking some phrases from the Open Bibliographic Data flyer) and otherwise stuck closely to the content of the Panton Principles. What do you think?  Also, everybody feel free to make the English sound good. I am no native speaker.
 
All the best
Adrian

I think this is a great idea and have commented on the Etherpad. I think it
should widened out from libraries. Otherwise I think the application of the
PP template to bibliography is brilliant and has immediate impact.

I don't know how much work it will take. For me, very little, but the legal
aspects of bibliography may be different from scientific data. If I'd seen
the mail 3 hours ago I could have asked Jordan.

James wrote about identifying a record that had been 'touched' in some way
by OCLC. I wonder if there is some scope for some work (or possibly
crowdsourcing) around this to help libraries understand where their
catalogue records have come from.

I'm not at all convinced that simply containing the OCLC number means that
the record comes from OCLC, but agree it could be an indicator

Can any cataloguing/MARC gurus confirm that in theory the 040 and 008/39 to
identify the source of cataloguing (as far as is possible)? What would be
really good is if we could start to compile a list of 'rights' or licensing
across those organisiations that can appear in 040? (perhaps even persuade
LoC and other agencies this should be added to organisational records which
have valid MARC21 Organisation codes in
http://www.loc.gov/marc/organizations/org-search.php and equivalent national
lists)

I realise that to be exhaustive would be a huge amount of work, but think
that to cover the main sources of records in a country wouldn't be too hard?

This could also help inform choices about where libraries who want to
publish open data get their bib data from?

Does this have any legs or is it pointless/too much work?

Owen, in fact anyone can add an OCLC number or delete one from a  
record -- there is no protection against that. As part of the WorldCat  
Local process, libraries send records to OCLC that do not have OCLC  
numbers, and OCLC matches them to the WC database and adds the number.  
That record could have come from anywhere, but now has an OCLC number.

I'm not by any means a guru in this area, but I think what we will run  
up against here is inconsistent use of the 040 field in different  
library systems. OCLC seems to always mark the source of updates by  
adding the library's code to the 040 field. I doubt if local systems  
do the same; that is, if a library has updated a record in their local  
system, my guess is that the 040 field is not necessarily updated. So  
should that record be exchanged directly with another library (or sent  
out to the cloud) that update is not registered.

It seems to me that there are only two things that can be known in  
*some* cases: 1) where did the record originate? (040 $a, the library  
that did the original cataloging) 2) where did the record immediately  
come from? (the 003, the sending agency). That said, I know for a fact  
that many libraries do not property set the 001 (local system id) and  
003 when they export records -- many send out records with the OCLC  
number in the 001, and their own system number in a 9xx field.

Once again, OCLC practices have overridden standards. OCLC puts the  
OCLC customer ID in the 040, not the standard MARC21 organization  
code. You can look up OCLC ids on their site, but I don't see a way to  
download the whole list.
   http://www.oclc.org/contacts/libraries/

I think that the upshot is: great idea, but the data may not support it.

:-)

Dear Jonathan, dear all,

Do you already know what time the working group will start on the 7th?

Ideally, I would like to do Amsterdam Berlin in the same day.  I see a
flight arriving at 10h10 in the morning with possible return at 18h55.
How far is the airport from the location of the meeting?  Is it doable
you think?

Thanks and best regards,

Lucie

Subject: [Communia-wg6] Workshop on Open Bibliographic Data and the
Public Domain, Berlin, 7th October

This is now announced:

 
http://blog.okfn.org/2010/08/17/workshop-on-open-bibliographic-data-and-
the-public-domain/

Registration is now open:

  http://publicdomain.eventbrite.com/

You can propose a session / topic / discussion / project here:

  http://okfnpad.org/pdobd

More info below...

= Workshop on the Open Bibliographic Data and the Public Domain =

== Details ==

  * Where: Rooms 108/108a, FU Berlin, Garystr. 21, 14195 Berlin
  * When: 7th October 2010
  * Register: http://publicdomain.eventbrite.com/
  * Tag: #pdobd
  * Notes: http://okfnpad.org/pdobd

== Overview ==

This one day workshop will focus on open bibliographic data and the
public domain. In particular it will address questions like:

  * What is the role of freely reusable metadata about works in
calculating which works are in the public domains in different
jurisdictions?
  * How can we use existing sources of open data to automate the
calculation of which works are in the public domain?
  * What data sharing policies in libraries and cultural heritage
institutions would support automated calculation of copyright status?
  * How can we connect databases of information about public domain
works with digital copies of public domain works from different
sources (Wikipedia, Europeana, Project Gutenberg, ...)?
  * How can we map existing sources of public domain works in
different countries/languages more effectively?

The day will be very much focused on productive discussion and
'getting things done' -- rather than presentations. Sessions will
include policy discussions about public domain calculation under the
auspices of Communia (a European thematic network on the digital
public domain), as well as hands on coding sessions run by the Open
Knowledge Foundation. The workshop is a satellite event to the The 3rd
Free Culture Research
Conference on 8-9th October:
<http://wikis.fu-berlin.de/display/fcrc/Home>.

== Sessions ==

Some ideas for things to do (please add!):

  * Data sharing policies which will support automated calculation of
which works are in the public domain in different countries
  * To what extent can we do automated calculation of which works are
in the public domain based on readily available data sources?
  * Discussion / drafting for a 'manual' for opening up bibliographic
data
  * Discussion of the role of bibliographic data to help determine
which works are in the public domain in which countries (to build
services like publicdomainworks.net)
  * Discussion / hacking on key technologies -- e.g. versioning for
data, RDF, data stores, user services, ...
  * Future of open bibliographic data -- what services people would
like to see (e.g. using data as backbone for new kinds of research
tools in digital humanities, representing data on maps/timelines)
  * Open bibliographic data / LOD
  * add things here! ;-)

Just a quick note to announce that v1.0 of the Open Publication
Distribution System (OPDS) specification was released yesterday [1].
OPDS is a profile of the Atom Syndication Format (RFC 4287 [2]) that
allows ebook publishers to share URLs for ebooks and the metadata
about them.

If you are familiar already with Atom, OPDS basically provides some
new link relations that lets OPDS aware clients identify URLs where
ebooks can be downloaded from. While it doesn't specifically leverage
an RDF serialization, it is fundamentally about linking library-land
data on the web, and typed links at that, so I thought it might be
relevant here.

If you are curious, and find examples more useful than specifications,
take a look at the implementations at the Internet Archive [3],
FeedBooks [4], the Pragmatic Programmers [5], or an experimental view
on arXiv [6].

The open ebook community and the Internet Archive are pleased to
announce the release of the first production version of the Open
Publication Distribution System (OPDS) Catalog format for digital
content.  OPDS Catalogs are an open standard designed to enable the
discovery of digital content from any location, on any device, and for
any application.

The specification is available at: http://opds-spec.org/specs/opds-catalog-1-0.

Based on the widely implemented Atom Syndication Format, OPDS Catalogs
have been developed since 2009 by a group of ebook developers,
publishers, librarians, and booksellers interested in providing a
lightweight, simple, and easy to use format for  developing catalogs
of digital books, magazines, and other content.

OPDS Catalogs are the first component of the Internet Archive?s
BookServer Project, a framework supporting open standards for
discovering, lending, and vending books and other digital content on
the web.

Brewster Kahle, digital librarian and founder of the Internet Archive,
says, ?As the audience for digital books grows, we can evolve from an
environment of single devices connected to single sources, into a
distributed system where readers can find books across the Web to read
on whatever device they have.  OPDS Catalogs can help people find,
buy, or borrow books, in the same way we use an open system to find
Web sites, delivering the promise of a digital library to millions of
readers around the world.?

OPDS Catalogs, which are easily produced from simple descriptive
metadata, can be harvested by search engines and aggregated by online
retailers; their design supports independent reading systems,
bookstores, the development of portable bookshelves, and other
applications facilitating the use of digital materials.

The Internet Archive makes available over 1 million public domain
books in EPUB and PDF formats through OPDS Catalogs [opds].  IA?s
titles are made available by Kobo Books, Amazon, and other
distributors.

PUBLISHERS -

For publishers, OPDS Catalogs offers new possibilities for digital
distribution and promotion.  ?We?re excited to support the OPDS
standard,? said Mark Coker, founder of Smashwords, a distributor of
over 18,000 ebooks for 8,000 independent authors and publishers around
the world.  ?Our mission is to maximize the distribution opportunities
for our authors.  By supporting OPDS Catalogs, we make it easy for
multi-platform e-reading apps, devices and online bookstores to expose
our catalog to millions of readers.?

Dave Thomas, co-founder of Pragmatic Programmers, a leading publisher
of programming books, says: ?The OPDS Catalogs specification is a
major step forward in opening up the distribution of electronic media
to a broader world?publishers and readers can interact directly via
the web and via reading devices to ensure that the most up-to-date
content is available in real time.?

MOBILE READERS -

OPDS Catalogs, derived from Lexcycle?s Stanza application, allow an
attractive presentation of book catalogs on mobile devices.
Well-known ebook expert Liza Daly, developer of the mobile reading
application, Ibis Reader, says, ?We?ve been impressed by how quickly
OPDS Catalogs allow us to offer a collection of thousands of free and
public domain books.  Now that users have access to a wide range of
different reading systems, it?s critical that the industry move toward
broad distribution networks that mirror the web.?

The leading independent reading application for the Android operation
system, Aldiko, also uses OPDS Catalogs.  Aldiko co-founder Tiffany
Wong says: ?OPDS Catalogs are a major step towards a truly open
ecosystem for ebook distribution, enabling more and more readers to
seamlessly connect with more and more content.?

LIBRARIES -

For libraries of all sizes, OPDS Catalogs can permit library patrons
to access digital books and other materials without having to visit a
library website.  In a special report [pdf] released in July 2010 on
ebooks for public libraries, the Council of State Library Agencies
(COSLA) endorsed the exploration of OPDS Catalogs.  The leader of the
COSLA task force, Oregon State Librarian Jim Scheppke, writes: ?State
librarians across the country have been looking for ways to improve
how library users discover and use library resources, especially
e-books. In Oregon, and in other states I?m sure, we look forward to
evaluating the potential of OPDS Catalogs as a basis for these
improvements.?

OPDS Catalogs can be used to make data from one site available to
others.  ?There is clear demand for enhancing library catalogs around
the world with information about ebooks,? says George Oates, the
project lead for Open Library.  ?We?re looking forward to using OPDS
Catalogs to help libraries supplement their own catalogs with ebook
records.?

work are located on this website.

  Where is the Mendeley data available?  If it is not, why discuss it
  here? OKFN would do better to promote the OKFN sponsored 3lib

Mendeley have stated that their data are Open. We have now formally asked
them through the OKF IsItOpen tool. If we don't hear soon we will assume
they are closed

Perhaps we should post them some blank DVDs
(with SASE) and ask them to put their open data
and documentation on them so that we can publish
on the Internet...

There is actually very little data anywhere that is formally labelled as
Open according to the OKD. Part of what we are doing is approaching poeple
who want to expose theie data and show them how to make it Open. It's
unclear whether Mendeley actually intend to make their data Open - if they
do, then we'll help advise them what needs to be done - it they don't they
we can highlight that this data is not Open and shouldn't be spoken of as
such.

  Forget about formal. Just make it available.

  Just make them make it available and then build services
  that demonstrate that further use is in the data holders interest.

  I agree. They are just like a library in this sense.
  Open metadata makes sense for publishers, not libraries.

  I think we should be saying this right away.

Available isn't good enough. That's the point of the Open Defintion. If it's
just "available" and you re-use it without permission they can send the
lawyers. They can close the site, etc.

On the contrary. Open metadata is essential for libraries.

  I understand that. But there are businesses such as Google, who
  index millions of sites every day. I am no lawyer, but I think that
  if you strictly interpret the law they would have to get prior
  consent to every copyright holder of every web page they index. They
  have not been closed.

  Let me make it clear that I mean libraries here is the
  traditional sense, as organizations that purchase information
  commodities and services and provide access to a defined 
  community.

Thanks Karen,

I've move this to a new thread for clarity. I think it would be useful to
try and just explore this a bit more.

It seems to me there are two possibilities going forward - either we can
identify where (at least some) records come from, or we can't. If the
latter, then a side effect is that there is no way to assert any rights over
the record (whether valid or not) (is this like an orphan work in some
way?).

If the former, then what tests can/should be applied to check provenance. I
can see two ways - either relying on the MARC standard to tell us where (if
people cared about it) provenance should be recorded, or by comparing two
records and trying to work out if they are similar enough to assert one is
derived from the other. I can't really see how the latter would work - which
way the derivation goes could be difficult, and in theory two correctly
formulated catalogue records could well end up being the same anyway even
with no relationship between the two.

PS the OCLC library list/codes has a machine interface (SRU I think) as well
as that web interface

Something being online is *surely* not sufficient to make it open?
Just because a picture is online this does not mean I am free to reuse
it for any purpose. Part of the raison d'etre of the OKF is to promote
the use of licenses (Creative Commons, Open Data Commons, ...), which
enable and encourage people to use material for any purpose. Rationale
is very similar to open source software. You need robust legal tools
and legal certainty for a data commons to scale. Hence, as Peter says,
the Open Knowledge Definition:

  http://www.opendefinition.org/

> Just make them make it available and then build services that
> demonstrate that further use is in the data holders interest.

I think there is a danger in having to constantly look for data
holders approval/consent when reusing datasets. This is basically not
so different from the permission based culture we currently have,
which arguably stifles innovation. Knowing that I may invest a bunch
of time into doing something and the data holder may refuse permission
if it is not 'good enough' or ask for a huge sum of money if it is, is
surely a bit of a disincentive?

In my work on meshing bibliographic datasets together, I've been using a
conceptual tool that I would like to hear views on.

I am creating nodes for the ideals of things on records - whether that is
for people, journals or even the bibliographic document itself. The ideal
represents the best and most complete data for that thing - something we'll
never really achieve, but that's not the point. This ideal serves as a node,
a hook,  on which we can join up records which describe the same thing
(person, frbr manifestation, etc) but which have differing data for.

It's easy to consider it for 'deduplications' of say article references.
Consider two records, one from the ris feed from pubmed and one from a
citation in a plos article. These are found to be references to the same
article but as you can expect they differ, not just in terms of data but
also on terms of the source or author of that reference.

The way I am tackling this is by creating a node for the ideal bibliographic
reference each aspires to and when dupes are believed to be found, these
ideal nodes are joined into a bundle using sameas (in a different store) and
this bundle has some provenance triples recording the how when and why for
this merging (using open provenance model verbs/classes)

Eg:

:bibrec  ---> record node from pubmed

:citerec  ---> plos record

_i suffix ---> ideal node

- running analyser on record suggests two records are dupes, with a certain
confidence score from a certain weighted matching (call this 'heur.v0.13')

Create ideal nodes Just In Time:

:bibrec hasIdeal :bibrec_i
:citerec hasIdeal :citerec_I

Make the bundle:

:b1 a Bundle
   sameas :bibrec_i
   sameas :citerec_I
   opmv:wasGeneratedBy :p1
   created: 2010-08-......

:p1 a opmv:Process
  Opmv:controlledBy :Ben
  Opmv:used :bibrec
  Opmv:used :citerec

:confidence a ConfidenceReport
  Opmv:wasGeneratedBy :p1
  Hasreport <url of doc>  # for time being

This structure let's me create an aggregated rdf dataset with the best guess
ideal records at any one time. Also, bundles can be merged later if required
creating a tree structure - the top bundle instance and the 'leaf' records
form a congruent closure and are thus exportable as such without the admin
structure triples necessary for ongoing maintenance. The bundle notion comes
from the excellent work by the team at southampton,  including Hugh glazer,
Ian milliard et al (google for coreference on the semantic web)

Using this technique for entities like people is actually very similar. If I
use the words 'person' and 'persona' for the ideal and the data in a record
respectively. The persona can have alternative spellings, and time-dependant
details like a fleeting institutional affiliation, and so on. The
(difficult) trick is spotting when two persona's refer to the same person
but the process for merging is the same even if the creation of an
aggregated record for each is different.

How I wish it weren't necessary though. On a more
philosophical level it is a gigantic counterproductive
waste of time and effort for society as a whole to spend
so much energy trying to make what are in my view
essentially fraudulent ownership claims over ideas.

Unfortunately they do, and vested intellectual property
interests have a lot of money and power. So organisations
like OKF and the FSF are necessary to protect the rest
of us. An unfortunate consequence of this is that *we*
have to spend some time and effort thinking about things
like licenses when we would rather be doing interesting
things with software and data.

Pretending the problem doesn't exist won't make it go
away.

Mutatis mutandis, the Europeana project (i.e. its conceptual model EDM) uses the same idea: there
are "ideals" (as you call them) for each object and ore:proxy-s (descriptions) associated with it.

I think this is reasoable as far as it goes. What you
haven't treated is how the properties present on
bibrec_i, citerec_i get migrated around.

The OWL rule that we're trying to bypass is,

{ ?x owl:sameAs ?y . ?x ?p ?o } => { ?y ?p ?o }

so do all properties from bibrec_i and citerec_i
get migrated to b1 and then any post-dedup queries
would typically be made against b1?

Also mind the implication of sameas. It commutes
so what you are also saying here is,

    :b1 a Person .
    :bibrec_i a Bundle .
    :citerec_i a Bundle .

So maybe you don't really mean owl:sameAs on the
bundle.

But if you don't mean owl:sameAs there, then where
do you put the properties? (Potential answer: pick
either bibrec_i or citerec_i arbitrarily and have a
specific predicate in the bundle to indicate that it
is the "primary" resource).

Cheers,

  No, but it's the basic start. The data has to be in a
  presentation-independent form (to avoid HTML scraping and suchlike).

  It depends on the business plan. Most of the data we deal
  with is advertizing its creator or copyright holder. It 
  is very unlikely that they will object. Getting them into
  taking positive action, e.g. upload a dataset, is much harder.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinrysQ0taf=bdA04Scogy-FFX-n3waQMJFPXo+k@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz) has published
those parts of its union catalog that were released under an open
licence [1] as Linked Open Data. The data is accessible via a
SPARQL-Endpoint [2] and a rudimentary web frontend [3]. These are
experimental services, e.g. they do not provide fulltext search
capabilities for end users.

Since the data has been released under a CC0-licence - making it
Linked Open Data and thus contrasting the Linked Data released by
other libraries - any interested party may download a complete dump of
the data [4]. The data is based on the latest exports released by the
hbz [5] in the form of RDF/ISO2709 [6].

The Bibliographic Ontology [7] was chosen to represent the catalog
data in a Linked-Data-environment. We are currently working on an
experimental transformation of the same data using RDA (Resource
Description and Access). So far, 4.896.515 records have been
converted, resulting in 82.471.813 RDF-triples. A more detailed
documentation of our activities can be found under [8].

The publication of Linked Data is organized on a decentralized basis.
In the library sector, this is reflected in the recent past by the
activities of the UB Mannheim and now through the Linked Data Service
of hbz. A problem not only limited to bibliographic data is the
resulting multiplicity of identifiers. An ongoing cooperative project
of the German National Library (DNB) and the hbz is to develop a
solution for the integration of bibliographic data from different
sources. We are currently working together on a first technical
prototype for this service. More detailed information will be
available in the coming weeks.

Cheers,
Felix
