Hello,

some people on this list might be interested in the Metafacture
toolkit for metadata processing. It is open source and developed by
the German National Library with a little help from hbz.

As I definitely could not describe it better, I just point to this
blog post by my colleague Fabian Steeg:

All the best

place in the same venue and run in parallel. During the collocated events,
delegates are welcome to choose sessions that best fit their interests from
either conference. Keynotes are held in common plenaries; and, social
events are shared, providing a excellent opportunity for DCMI and iPRES
delegates to socialize, share common interests and network. Delegates of
the two conferences may separately register for a mix of pre- and
post-conference events organized by the conference committees of both iPRES
and DCMI.

DC-2013 speakers and tutorial leads include: Gildas Illien, Ivan Herman,

Subject: [open-bibliography] 9 days left to enter the Veni Competition using
 Linked and Open Data in Education!
Message-ID: <CAB53Ly4-d5duUt5E5Z8oPeuigWVURffMkAqR+ZLLazB-bGemfw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

Can you create a guidance system to help self-learner search and select
online courses that seem to best suit their needs? Could you find a way to
make research papers more accessible, and more easily read by less-advanced
learners? Or have you any thoughts on how teachers in the developing world
can benefit from the open resources freely available online?

Well, there is still time to enter the Veni Competition! Whilst there are
just 9 days remaining, that's enough time to pull together a prototype or
demo that analyses and/or integrates linked and open web data for
educational purposes.

With a total prize fund of 5,000 EUR, and our award ceremony taking place
at OKCon <http://okcon.org/> in Geneva on 17 September 2013, there is no
excuse not to enter!

Find out more on our blog <http://linkedup-project.eu/2013/06/17/524> or on
our website <http://linkedup-challenge.org/>.

Best wishes

Message-ID: <CAOtd05Ey3-vk1_pbU1_6XkGksrb+7MhWr8y9FhiANXK2rvYjFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

yesterday I published a post called "Discovery silos vs. the open web"
on openbiblio.net, see [1].

The developments described in the post might be a good reason for this
group to take some action. I see the opportunity for our group to get
libraries to push towards open metadata from content providers.

My proposal: We develop something like Igelu's proposed clause for
contracts between libraries and content providers with the difference
that our proposed clause should enable the publication of metadata as
open data. (Actually, I already proposed something like this for the
last virtual meeting, see [3].)

What do you think?

All the best
Adrian

"Long-term Preservation and Governance of RDF Vocabularies"

Special session, DC-2013, Lisbon, 3 September

DC-2013 WEBSITE: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2013
DC-2013 DATES: 2-6 September 2013
DC-2013 PLACE: Lisbon, Portugal

=================================
SESSION SPONSOR: W3C & DCMI
SESSION DATE/TIME: 3 September, 11:30-1600
   (Day registration available on conference wesbite)
SESSION MODERATORS:
  -- Phil Archer, World Wide Web Consortium
  -- Thomas Baker, Dublin Core Metadata Initiative
  -- Ivan Herman, World Wide Web Consortium
  -- Pierre-Yves Vandenbussche, Fujitsu
  -- Bernard Vatant, Mondeca
=================================

The oldest RDF vocabularies in existence are just fifteen years old.  It is
time to look systematically at how ownership and responsibility for today's
vocabularies will pass to the next generation.  DCMI and W3C are sponsoring
a special session at the DC-2013 conference in Lisbon on 3 September about
the long-term preservation and governance of RDF vocabularies [1].

This session focuses on issues related to the usability of RDF vocabularies
in the long term (as defined in "decades") -- continued access to
documentation, inheritance of ownership and maintenance responsibility, and
the continued resolvability of domain names.  What role might memory
institutions play in the long-term preservation of vocabularies?

A discussion paper has been prepared as a starting point for this session
[2], and readers are welcome to post comments or suggestions on the
DC-VOCABULARY mailing list ([3], sign up at [4]).

Hi all,

For those who have not seen it yet, Europeana has quite a few interesting
job ads at the moment. For this list mainly the 'API-evangelist' and the
'Aggregation Team leader' seem to be most interesting.

=== EXTENDED DEADLINE for Participation: CAMP-4-DATA Workshop in Lisbon ===

"CAMP-4-DATA WORKSHOP: Cyber-infrastructure & Metadata Protocols"

Dublin Core-Science and Metadata Community (DC-SAM) and Research Data
Alliance (RDA) are hosting a day-long Metadata Interest Group workshop on 6
September 2013 in Lisbon, Portugal. Submissions for participation are
currently open in the areas of short papers, abstracts, and position
statements.

Metadata is vital to the discovery and management of scientific data.
DC-SAM, RDA, and related communities advocate for access to, and shared
knowledge about, metadata standards that support data life-cycle
management. CAMP-4-DATA participants will explore infrastructure design,
applications, and policies that can advance the support of open, collective
and sustainable access to metadata standards used for managing scientific
data.  The intent of this workshop is to discuss and forward challenges and
opportunities relating to metadata standards for the management of
scientific data, and how policies, applications, and infrastructure can
foster creation of and access to sustainable, open, and collective
standards.

The CAMP-4-DATA workshop is part of post-conference activities of DC-2013.

Submissions will remain open through 12 July 2013.
