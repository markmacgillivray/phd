Sorry to all. I sent the last mail with the wrong subject (I first
thought, I would have to postpone the meeting, but it WILL NOT be

Subject: [open-bibliography] BibBase - bibliography manager
Message-ID: <CAE9vqEFrAZ6D0ouFu7djC4xLnao8qQ79xGYap4ReRgc8tkn0ew@mail.gmail.com>

I ran across this today and it seems very similar to the publication list /
reading list manager use case of BibSoup, so thought it would be of
interest.

http://bibbase.org/

There's RDF exposed at http://data.bibbase.org

It's primary input format is BibTeX, but it'll also fetch from Mendeley.

On the output side they provide:
- a couple of ways to generate HTML to display a bibliography in a web page
e.g. http://www.cs.toronto.edu/kr/
- an RSS feed
- individual paper and whole list BibTeX exports
- RDF output

They address deduplication in this paper:
http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj185_1.pdf
but it sounds pretty ad-hoc.

Hope this information is useful.  I was surprised not to have heard about
it before.

==============***ANNOUNCEMENT***==============

Semantic Search: Magnet for the Needle in the Search Haystack
A Joint NKOS-CENDI Workshop

DOT Media Center, Oklahoma City Room
U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington DC
Thursday, December 6, 2012 ? 8:30 am-4:30 pm

What is Semantic Search? What user requirements does it seek to address?
How is Semantic Search being implemented? How can Semantic Search
technologies be evaluated? What results have we seen thus far, and what are
the areas of research that may bring future improvements? These questions
and related topics will be addressed by experts in semantic search and
related technologies, users, implementers and academic researchers. Dean
Allemang, Chief Technology Officer and Chief Data Scientist at Open Data
Registry (previously of TopQuadrant) will place semantic search in the
semantic web landscape. Dr. Denise Bedford, Goodyear Professor of Knowledge
Management at Kent State University, will discuss the various views of
semantic search. Other speakers will address linked data applications in
libraries, museums and archives; the impact of semantic search on
visualization tools; and the development of tools to support semantic
search in particular communities. Information managers and technologists
from various user communities will discuss the needs of their end users
that they are seeking to address with semantic search. Students working in
this area will provide a look at the future through a series of lightning
talks.

This workshop will be of interest to information managers, technologists,
content providers, enterprise architects and researchers across sectors.

Registration is now open. The registration and program are available from:
http://www.cendi.gov/activities/12_06_2012_CENDI_NKOS.html

I was reading the minutes of this meeting from a couple of weeks ago and
noticed this:


   - Restructuring of OKF


   - Projects and tools are now pulled into OKFN labs, which will mainly
   focus on government and financial data: http://okfnlabs.org/


 That sounds like a pretty significant change.  Are there more detail
available somewhere?  Will there be any bibliographic data related efforts
going forward or did everything end with BibJson & BibServer?

  There are other open bibiographic data efforts out
  there. I for one, intend to continue with 3lib 
  (sponored by OKFN) and AuthorClaim. These projects
  complement BibServer.

	'Beginners'
Message-ID: <CANdsPBxU7oXGKwpkozR_ngF=7yAziadbGo6Ay=PcGTGecRruXA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear People,

In the first instance, I hope that this is the correct list, but if not, my
apologies and please post to a list that could help?

I appreciate this might be a 'duhhhhhhh' question to you, but I hope you
will tolerate my ignorance!? I'm running a basic Research Methodology
course for Registrars (Drs specialising in some subject area e.g.
surgery, paediatrics, etc.) who do not have a high level of computer or
information literacy. As we are an 'evolving campus' and don't have Endnote
or Refworks or whatever at our disposal, could you please recommend the
best free and open source reference manager software that is relatively
'easy' to master?

I want to try and inculcate the habit of saving all their references right
from the start, keeping all necessary details to prevent the late 'search'
for 'that' document / article.........

Thanks and keep up the good work.

Best best,

Jakes

PS The idea that all specialities are now to hand in a Masters dissertation
as part of the specialisation requirements is a great development in South
Africa. Previuosly it was only the Community Health, now Public Health
Medicine folk who had to do it. We might get an increased research output as
a result....

For easy to use 'free' reference manager software, I'd recommend
Mendeley http://www.mendeley.com/

If you want it to be both free AND open source then I'd recommend:
Zotero http://www.zotero.org/
or JabRef http://jabref.sourceforge.net/

see also this comparison of the various options available on Wikipedia:

All the best,

Subject: [open-bibliography] Visualising filters w/ Bubble charts
Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzhEhHQvtgTStAFJM=uWg3LTbQ0DC72RTn6YvByaRnnTg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

So I've uploaded some test data to
bibsoup<http://bibsoup.net/rossmounce/zootaxa_sample>(with the
intention of uploading *much* larger data ~11k record collections
at a later date).

How do I view the nice bubble charts?

I find on the 'filter by', on the dropdown menu there's an option to
'visualise this filter' but when I click on this I don't see anything? Just
a big empty white box.

I know there's probably, hopefully, a really simple answer to this but I
can't seem to figure it out by myself...


Any ideas?

Best,

Ross

Hello Tom,

please excuse the delayed response. Regarding this:

> Restructuring of OKF
>
> Projects and tools are now pulled into OKFN labs, which will mainly focus on
> government and financial data: http://okfnlabs.org/

As I understood Joris who reported on this this doesn't mean that OKFN
won't do anything in the realm of bibliographic data anymore. It just
means that OKFN labs will be built up and that OKFNlabs will focus on
government and finacnial data. Joris brought this up because he wants
to build something similar for GLAM projects (something like
"openglamlabs"). So the bibliographic data efforts and GLAM projects
won't go away in OKF at least so long this group does some work on it.

The rest of the minutes reads accordingly:

[quote]
* Rather than ?orphan? the other projects, there is now another lab in
development for those, including Bibserver.
* Example projects/code and blog posts that woul find their place at
this ?open culture lab?:
** Working with DBPedia extracting data to put into timeline, see here.
** Querying DBpedia for Public Domain Authors:
http://www.uebertext.org/2012/10/querying-dbpedia-to-find-public-domain.html
* Joris, Sam and Etienne Posthumus working on this. Please propose
projects to Joris and Sam and they can help.
* Suggest: organize ?code days? for bibliographic data

All the best

I don't know what is going on there. Obviously there are also users
and collections missing. At least, I can not login anymore and my
collections are gone.

I am putting Mark in Cc, perhaps he knows the answer.

Subject: [open-bibliography] is open access only for rich countries?
	invitation to a discussion
Message-ID: <50AE1656.8040001@ajantriks.net>

Participate now in an online dialogue on open access and the developing 
world

You are invited to take part in an online discussion on Open Access (OA) 
from the perspective of the developing world.

Funded by DFID, through the Mobilising Knowledge for Development (MK4D) 
programme in the Institute for Development Studies at Sussex University, 
and managed through the African Commons project in South Africa and the 
Centre for Internet and Society in India, the discussion will be hosted 
on UNESCO?s WSIS Open Access Community Forum. This open access dialogue 
will provide a valuable space to discuss different perspectives on what 
open access means for the developing world and what it can offer.

There is compelling evidence which indicates that OA has finally entered 
mainstream discourse. Yet, in the developing world context there remain 
specific challenges and untapped opportunities for OA. A series of open 
access discussions aimed at developing world critical thinkers, 
activists and academics, seeks to explore insights and articulate 
opinion on OA in the developing world.  Join us for stimulating debate!

Register here: 
http://institutefordevelopmentstudies.createsend1.com/t/r-l-kuxltt-jluthukldd-j/

Setting the context

Open access has enjoyed a great deal of acceptance and growth over the 
last decade, with a particularly strong spurt in the adoption of open 
access policies by major agencies and governments in the last 12 months. 
With open access policies and initiatives now being taken up by UNESCO, 
the World Bank, the FAO, the European Commission, and the governments of 
the United Kingdom and the United States, among others, it is clear that 
open access has entered the global mainstream. These policies stress the 
human rights potential of open access in providing access to scientific 
and cultural knowledge, ensuring its impact and ensuring public access 
to publicly funded research.

We now know that open access can work in the immediate and short term in 
providing better access to the research literature, whilst some of the 
longer term consequences and effects are still emerging. This is 
especially so in the developing world, which has been badly served by 
the publishing system we have inherited from the 20th century, which has 
marginalized research from developing countries. New opportunities and 
possibilities are created by open access, and, at the same time certain 
pitfalls need to be noted and avoided.

A foundational report prepared to inform this dialogue shows the risks 
posed to all scholarly communications, discourse and practices by the 
publish-or-perish system, and indicates that in the developing world, 
the detriments are potentially much deeper and more damaging.  As 
researchers are incentivised to publish in overseas-based journals - 
mostly unavailable in many developing world contexts - this research 
?brain-drain? risks widening the gap between research and policy [1].

Read more here

Get discussing!

The first debate will kick off on Tuesday, 27 November 2012.

A general topic will be complemented by two sub discussions.  The 
discussion will be hosted on the WSIS Knowledge Platform's Open Access 
group. To take part you will be required to register on the platform.

KEY TOPIC: Production, publication and consumption of scholarly 
knowledge and OA.

This will focus on the greater concern of scholarly research in the 
developing country context debating the questions: What does OA imply 
and offer the developing world in terms of production, publication and 
consumption of academic materials and research activities? What are the 
specific challenges and opportunities for access to knowledge in 
developing countries?

Within this topic the following sub-themes will be introduced:

Sub-theme 1: Considering the issues of 'translation' of research for 
development impact; co-production and increasing access to academic 
materials; and the importance of OA in producing and sharing of 
non-state-supported educational materials; and

Sub-theme 2: OA in academia and the search for global prestige; the 
perverse impact of metrics and rankings; scholarly knowledge production; 
and sharing and consumption challenges in developing countries.

We will keep you posted about the second debate which will take place 
early in January 2013.

In the meantime you are also encouraged to tweet about the discussions 
using hashtag #developoa or follow the debates on Facebook here

Hi Ross, Adrian, List,

There is a simple answer, but it does not solve your problem immediately -
the whole of bibsoup will be moving soon to another provider so that we can
ramp up collection sizes. I am also finishing some updates to improve the
functionality. This is all taking longer than I would have liked, and
people have offered to help, but it is basically just a slow process thing
- I continue to hope it will be done soon, and once it is, it will be worth
you uploading your larger collection. Early December, I hope. After that,
it should be easier for people to use or for others to assist with running
/ developing.

Mark

"LINKING TO THE FUTURE"
International Conference on Dublin Core and Metadata Applications
2-6 September 2013, Lisbon, Portugal

=============================================
DC-2013 CALL FOR PARTICIPATION
=============================================

DC-2013 will explore questions regarding the persistence, maintenance, and
preservation of metadata and descriptive vocabularies. The need for stable
representations and descriptions spans all sectors including cultural
heritage and scientific data, eGovernment, finance and commerce. Thus, the
maintenance and management of metadata is essential to address the long
term availability of information of legal, cultural and economic value.  On
the web, data?and especially descriptive vocabularies?can change or vanish
from one moment to the next. Nonetheless, the web increasingly forms the
ecosystem for our vocabularies and our data. DC-2013 will bring together in
Lisbon the community of metadata scholars and practitioners to engage in
the exchange of knowledge and best practices in developing a sustainable
metadata ecosystem.

DC-2013 will be collocated and run simultaneous with iPRES 2013 providing a
rich environment for synergistic exploration of issues common to both
communities.
