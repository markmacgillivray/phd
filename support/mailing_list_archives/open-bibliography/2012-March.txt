Message-ID: <CACGRf4+wQTNEqrTjHOYFhueY9Kjoa8CHAM_1iinQfkLisum_xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

For anyone in or near Edinburgh, or anyone able to travel of an evening:

*Come along to the very first Scotland-based Meet-up, on the evening of
Tuesday 13th March at the Ghillie Dhu in Edinburgh.*

DevCSI and the Open Biblio team are in town for a meeting and thought it'd
be a good opportunity to meet like-minded and interesting people, so we're
inviting everyone along for lightening talks and chat at the esteemed
Ghillie Dhu in central Edinburgh. We have Sam Leon presenting on the Public
Domain Review, Laura Newman giving a talk on the School of Data and its
Handbook, and Mark MacGillivray speaking on Open Biblio; if you have
something you'd like to talk about, e-mail me and we'll add you to the
schedule (remember, lightning is fast - 3 mins only please!). Otherwise,
just come along for the fun, join in with talk of open data / knowledge in
general and set the world to rights over a brew.

Tell your friends - all are welcome. See you there!

For more information see the Meet-up
post<http://www.meetup.com/OpenKnowledgeFoundation/Edinburgh-GB/618812/>and
feel free to reply to this e-mail for info or to volunteer for a
lightning talk.

Regards,
Naomi

Subject: [open-bibliography] Orphan data
Message-ID: <4F501F80.8090509@kcoyle.net>

I have run into a case of "orphan data" that, in part, arises from a 
desire to be "open." In this case, an organization hosts -- but does not 
create -- bibliographic data in a large database. There are no stated 
"owners" of any of the bibliographic records; they are being shared by a 
community with no one claiming any rights.

When asked to let someone use the data under PDDL (or even CC0), the 
hosting organization declined because they consider themselves to have 
no rights to grant a license.

Thus, openness has led to an "orphan data" problem. Potential users 
cannot obtain a license or even a statement of public domain because 
there is no declared owner.

Any ideas for a solution?

Claim ownership and then release it under PDDL?

don't think so. It's either yours or not yours, I don't think that you 
can license something unless you've got some legal right to it, and I 
don't think that a claim can establish that right. (OK, it worked for 
conquerers and the entire manifest destiny across this continent, but I 
think someone might call you out if you tried it today.)

If this is true, then it is not an orphaned work.

Yes, but that is why I suggested it as a solution. If the problem is
that the work is orphaned, then by claiming it you will find out if
that is really the case. Either way, you find who the owner is
(perhaps you), and you find (or assert) the licence inflicted upon it.

No, orphan works are those for whom the owner cannot be identified: the 
work is *potentially* owned but the fact cannot be established.

That said, "orphan works" are assumed to under copyright -- otherwise 
they would be in the public domain. I'm not saying that this database is 
copyrightable by called it 'orphaned.' I'm saying that the ownership of 
the data cannot be established.

Right, but the holding institution does not want to own it. They want it 
to be open, totally open. So in order to avoid owning the data, they 
have said that they do not own it and do not want to own it. There 
simply is no owner. But that means there is also no one to grant a 
license, and someone who wants to use it prefers to have a clear, legal 
license.

Now, if we weren't in the US, where people tend to take each other to 
court at the drop of a hat, organization #2 would just happily use the 
data. But both of these organizations are commercial entities, and 
messing around with something this ambiguous sends their lawyers into a 
tizzy.

I don't think we can solve their problem, but I think it's worth 
thinking about orphan data which, like orphan intellectual works, create 
a usage limbo (at least wherever you have nervous lawyers). In this 
case, ownership (and PDDL) may have been more advantageous than the more 
heartfelt declaration of openness.

We have stated that bibliographic data (of certain sorts) are de facto in
the public domain. No one has challenged this. So go ahead and release it.

There are organizations who delight in making thing complicated and then
asserting that they can't do anything.

There is a risk associated with anything. Anyone can sue anyone (certainly
in the US) for anything. That doesn't mean that they will win. The ACS sued
Google for using the word "Scholar" in "Google Scholar". They "lost".

The ACS could probably sue me for what I have just written. I hope they
would lose

This is a question of risk. Without a clear owner the risk is minimal.
What, anyway, is being copyrighted? the collection? some added
non-bibliographic data?

The risk is less than being hit by an asteroid. Go ahead

I think similar issues may well come up again. As long as the question of whether the data in question is subject to copyright or not, it seems to me that there is uncertainty on the part of any publishing organisation as to whether they have the right to license the data (my understanding for CC, and presumably ODC licenses, is that you can only apply the license if you are the copyright holder?)

This is always going to come down to some assessment of risks - and I always try to frame discussions about the release and use of bibliographic data in this way. To assert CC0 when you aren't sure you have the copyright is a risk to the licensor. To use the data even though there is no explicit license for reuse is a risk to the user. I'd say the level of risk is probably about the same (I'm with Peter in terms of his assessment of it - very very low), but in the case of the risk being realised, the potential impact of being the 'publisher' as opposed to 'consumer' is probably higher - so the risk assessment is subtly different.

While I would certainly encourage this organisation to take the risk as Peter suggests (and at the very least, do a risk assessment to ensure they understand the issues), I wonder if publishing with a 'no known restrictions' type statement might be another way of doing this. The Flickr Commons use the statement "No known copyright restrictions"  http://www.flickr.com/commons/usage/. I realise this is not the ideal, and I guess some will be very much against the idea, but where copyright is unclear it is difficult to know what other statement can be made where organizations or individuals assess the risk of asserting rights to be too high.

I like this thread.

Ownership is not something magic, it comes from the ability to enforce
some sort of exclusive right of use or occupation. That's literally
backed up by the threat of force. Often we don't see that played out
in places like Europe and North America these days because if I go and
occupy, you'll call the police and they'll happily use force to remove
me -- that's what police are for. That's so ingrained as to be obvious
so it just isn't done.

Similarly with copyright, they'll take you, physically, and put you in
jail and shoot you if you try to escape if you try to go too far in
flaunting the system and step on someone with the will and clout to
insist on their rights' toes.

Is there any likelihood at all that in this situation *anybody* is
going to pursue things to a level even approaching that? Most likely
not. The worst that will happen is someone might write a blog post
saying they disagree.

So I agree with Mark. Just assert ownership so far as to explicitly
put the thing in the public domain. If someone comes out of the
woodwork and disagrees it might make for an interesting
discussion. I'd wager even that won't happen.

Don' worry! :)

Cheers,

So why not setup a clearing house service by which OKF takes orphaned data (or other with unclear rights) and publishes it with an open license?

The Open Library doesn't go this far in terms of asserting a license, opting for the vague "It's complicated". However, anecdotally, by acting as an intermediary with an 'open' intent, they have enabled re-use that otherwise might have been seen as too risky.

I like Owen's phrase.

There is also the pragmatic and possibly legal defence of "best endeavour".
If we tell the world what we are doing very visibly and after a period then
take action then at the very least the damages would be much reduced.

We can't protect against submarine suits  but I doubt that's the case here.

But once it is in the public domain it's in that status forever I am
told... it cannot be revoked, correct ?  So the only risk is that of being
sued for monetary damages from some owner, once they come forward and PROVE
they have ownership, not merely claiming it.

I also like Owen's phrase as well.

How long does "best endeavour" period last ?  3 months, 6 months ?  what is
typical or advisable ?

There seem to be lots of people encouraging someone else to take a
risk.  A better approach would be to offer to indemnify them from any
and all damages if they take that risk.  That would show the depth of
your convictions.

This data didn't just appear out of nowhere.  Where did they get it?
If they provide the downstream consumers with the provenance
information, they can make their own risk assessment, in conjunction
with their lawyers, and decide what they want to do.

What does it consist of? If it's all unarguably data which is not
subject to copyright or any other type of IP protection (e.g. contract
law binding on some who received the data as part of service), then
that information can be provided to downstream consumers.

To my mind it's a little bit disingenuous of the hosting organization
to refuse to provide any information about the data.  The cynic in me
says that they know there's a problem, but don't want to 'fess up.

Situations like this are why organizations which deal in intellectual
property should be rigorous about tracking the provenance of data that
they get, mash up, redistribute, etc.  It's very difficult to
impossible to sort things out after the fact.

The reason the lawyers involved are skittish is because a) they're
paid to be paranoid and b) they know that people play fast and loose
with this stuff.  Having said that, it's not the lawyer's call at the
end of the day.  There will be some business type who takes the
lawyers risk assessment and makes a business decision as to whether or
not the risk is worth the reward.

Years ago I was involved in putting together a public domain software
compilation CD (back when "public domain" was the predominant flavor
of open source software).  Finding something on the net labelled
"public domain" wasn't good enough because it might have been some
proprietary piece of code that someone had rebadged.  For each program
we had to track down the author and get a letter stating that a) they
were the author and owned all rights to the program and b) that they
were releasing it into the public domain.  No author, no letter, no
inclusion in the compilation.

It's all well and good to tell someone else "go ahead in and take the
risk," but in the real world they're just going to ignore you (and
think you're naive/nuts to boot).

This isn't a question about copyright, and most data and metadata are 
not considered for copyright. It's about licensing and contracts. That's 
a different area of law. That is the area of law that we covered in our 
principles, not copyright.

Yes, this is the kind of thing I am looking for. Can we come up with a 
standard way, not unlike CC, that states: we have no idea who owns this 
stuff, no one is claiming ownership, etc. etc. As more and more data 
(and metadata) comes onto the web we will have more of these situations. 
If nothing else, there should be a way for the holder of a piece of 
information to say: "I'm not claiming any rights, not even physical 
ownership rights, over this data once it leaves my database."

Yes, this is a great idea. Provide a place (dataLeaks? :-)) where people 
can place data that they consider to be open but for various reasons 
(mainly the fact of being a for-profit in a world of greed) they prefer 
that the "liability" be placed elsewhere.

Of course, one possibility is using the Internet Archive in this way. As 
Owen mentioned, they have simply placed many millions of metadata 
records in the archive with no restrictions on retrieving them. But I 
prefer an explicit "data warehouse" and in particular an explicit 
"bibliographic data warehouse." I will talk to the parties and see if we 
can't at least get a dump for the data hub (duh! I should have thought 
of that). Then we need to invent the "no known restrictions" declaration 
(and logo).

Does this sound like an idea?

Unfortunately, US courts have revoked PD, and it was taken to higher 
courts and upheld.

Ah, which probably goes back to Tom's mention of providing and proving
provenance.  And when it's proved, then the courts revoke Public Domain on
data or whatever else.  Interesting.

If we provide such a space / concept / logo, then we at the same time
promote the idea that things found say just on the internet with no
claims attached to them are not freely available. Promoting such a
default stance would do nothing except promote the interests of people
who want to own everything. As long as people are indoctrinated into
thinking they are not allowed to do what they want, then they will not
be allowed to do what they want.

Do you have any sort of contract or licensing arrangement with the organization
that has the data?  If not-- if, for instance, you just came across
it on a public website-- then you shouldn't be bound by one, I wouldn't think.
If you happen to be bound by one, is anyone else able to view the data who is
not subject to a contract?

Also, how large is the data set?  Is it of a size that would make it
feasible to "re-curate" (that is, check the facts asserted, add anything
else that seems relevant, and delete or change irrelevant or badly
encoded information, or expressions that are not simply factual)?
If feasible, I'd think that would be sufficient
processing to address US copyright and provenance concerns.

(Note however, that I am not a lawyer, let alone your lawyer)

A number of cultural institutions (including LC and the Smithsonian)
use a "no known restrictions" or "no known copyright restrictions" notation
(this is standard in Flickr Commons, for instance).  I think I recall hearing
a while of some efforts to create a standard coding for that, but I can't
find the discussions off the top of my head.

John, this is a large dataset, and not available as a batch anywhere at 
this time. I have no interest in obtaining it, but I would be happy to 
see it "freed" if that is economical for the holding organization.

But mainly I saw this as an interesting example of a kind of "gotcha" 
that I hadn't considered before: datasets with no one claiming 
ownership. That doesn't make them public domain, it really makes them 
orphans.

Sorry, Mark, I need you to unpack this a bit. Are you saying that this 
is a good thing or a bad thing?

As per copyright law, any "work" created is covered by copyright 
regardless of explicit statements claiming rights. That's standard Berne 
convention. So documents, videos, sounds, are all covered by copyright. 
Thus: CC to allow people to make their preferences clear on things that 
they have created. Data is the exception and it's so complex and 
convoluted that no one knows what data is and is not covered by 
copyright. Thus PDDL and other data licenses. Those of us who want our 
data widely used unfortunately need to make a declaration of that 
nature. It's actually a service to the potential end users who then 
don't have to worry or wonder because they have a clear statement of the 
status.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Bibliographical data for the world's lesser
	known languages
Message-ID: <op.wajzv7u4pbi2z2@lingua182>

Dear all,
for the last 2.5 years, I have been working on Langdoc, a comprehensive  
collection of bibliographical data for the world's lesser known languages.  
It provides access to more than 180,000 references of descriptive works  
such as grammars, dictionaries, word lists, texts etc. Search criteria  
include author, year, title, document type, macro?area, and genealogical  
affiliation.

All data are/will soon be  available as RDF and in a variety of other  
formats. There should be a SPARQL endpoint later this month.

Data are available under CC-BY-NC due to some issues upstream.

I am hoping to receive feedback about best practices for the further  
development of this resource

Best wishes
Sebastian

Dear Sebastian. Very interesting to see this.
My main suggestion would be to for you to make the data available in
BibJSON  http://bibjson.org which would provide higher quality upload to
BibServer displays than can be done with your present BibTeX.
It would be excellent if you could install a BibServer to display the data your site.
Do you have sys admin or programming resources who could contribute to such an installation?

One comment about
> Data are available under CC-BY-NC due to some issues upstream.

When I look at a typical page e.g. http://glottolog.livingsources.org/resource/reference/id/121160.xhtml I see the logo for CC BY NC ND, though the link is to
CC-BY-NC . I suggest you change the logo to a CC-BY-NC logo to avoid confusion.

As a technical point, I think the CC-BY-NC license on the data needs to be indicated in individual records such as at the above link. This is something we have not yet dealt with in BibJSON, but this is a basic provenance issue which we will have to deal with sooner or later. I would be 
glad to work with you on this.
While the NC clause is not my favorite, I appreciate the need of some data providers to insist on it, and we need to find a way to express this and other licensing conditions in biblio data records.

HI Sebastian, thanks a lot for sharing this, it is a great collection
you have built.

What sort of data are you holding? If you are interested in justifying
a wider licence, then have a look at our open bibliographic principles
at http://openbiblio.net/principles.


> I am hoping to receive feedback about best practices for the further

What sorts of further development are you wanting to do? If you are
looking for a new tool to maintain your collection, and are interested
in providing JSON output, then the bibserver software may be of
interest to you - http://bibserver.org and
http://github.com/okfn/bibserver. Also our bibjson format is detailed
at http://bibjson.org (you can add licence details to each record if
you desire - http://bibjson.org/#license).

If you want further information then please do get back to us with
further questions.

Mark

This registry is for content, not metadata, but it presumably could be
extended to bibliographic data or something similar could be
established for it.

http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/nesson/digital-registry/

Some of the things which distinguish it in my mind are a) a set of
standards and practices for curation and b) legal support to defend
users.

Very cool!  What relation, if any, does this have to the Ethnologue or
Rosetta projects?

> Data are available under CC-BY-NC due to some issues upstream.

Depending on how the data have been mingled and how separable they
are, you might consider distributing two data sets: 1) your current
CC-BY-NC data set and 2) a CC-BY subset without the NC restriction.

Mark, this is not what you indicated in previous discussion when you implied it 
was obvious that the license assertion was about the work being indexed by the
record, and not the record itself. For instances like this with records
licensed CC BY NC, and original works under some other license, 
the subject of the license assertion does not seem obvious from context. So I think 
we need a convention to indicate whether the license assertion in a BibJSON record is 
about the record itself, or about the work it refers to.

It appears that CC BY NC applied to individual biblio records has little force.
The license itself contains the waiver: 
"Public Domain ? Where the work or any of its elements is in the public domain under applicable law, that status is in no way affected by the license."
Users of a bibliographic record could readily argue that its elements were PD.
Still, CC BY NC has the value that an arguably NC operation like OKF can
index or reprocess the entire collection without little risk of copyright infringement.

I think we should be encouraging reprocessors of biblio records to indicate their
sources as a matter of best practice, even if not a legal obligation. Providing
an easy way to do this in BibJSON seems like a step toward this goal.
I'd like to hear from others about this provenance issue, and how best to include
provenance assertions as well as license assertions in BibJSON. Is there an available
 standard for such purposes which we can  adopt?

Yes, by default I think it is obvious that license information is
about the work rather than the record itself, and I have no personal
interest in attaching licenses to bibliographic metadata records; but
this does not mean that others cannot, if they desire.


> we need a convention to indicate whether the license assertion in a BibJSON record is

Yes, any suggestions from the list on how we might identify a license
object as being about the record itself rather than the work would be
useful.

The OKF is a "not-for-profit" organization in the UK
(http://okfn.org/about/)  but it may and does indulge in commercial
activity - the exchange of
goods and services for money or other value. Defining "commercial"
precisely is almost impossible and one reason why many of us argue strongly
against its use.

I would personally release data as CC-0, but getting the bib data in the  
first place was delicate. For instance, Australian data from  
http://ozbib.aiatsis.gov.au/ have the following disclaimer

>>> It is a condition of use of this database that users ensure that any

At this point in time, there is no way that AIATSIS will ever agree to  
CC-0, or anything that meets the Open Definition.

I can probably provide BibJSON output within a reasonable time frame.  
Would you want this on a per-record basis, or would you want one huge  
BibJSON file? Would this go via conneg, or would you want  
http://../../xyz.json in the URL?

I will probably not run a bibserver instance myself, but I can give my  
data to people who do have a bibserver running.

Note that the data are heterogeneous,  messy and not normalized, so there  
will be lots of errors.

Furthermore, we have a persistence problem as our department will close in  
2015. I would want the data to be shared and copied before that.

Yes, your example is complicated.

This depends on what you want to achieve. Our software provides
records or collections via conneg at the URLs, and you could build in
similar functionality to your service, but a dump of your content may
also be appropriate. See below.

If you are looking to have another copy of the data stored somewhere,
and cannot run a bibserver instance, then you could do a conversion of
your data to bibjson and upload to bibsoup.net. Also, if you want to
persist copies of your data, either in your current format or in
bibjson (or both), then take a look at thedatahub.org - it provides a
place to put datasets for storage and discoverability. A bibjson
dataset stored there could be used as the resource for a
bibserver-based instance of your collection, thus increasing the
number of available copies and access methods, and giving the URL /
conneg sort of access to your individual records.

The 'languoid' part is similar to Ethnologue, but more conservative and  
more empirical. We strictly follow the scientific literature, whereas  
Ethnologue maintain their own records, which are not publicly accessible  
and regularly depart from scholarly consensus.

Glottolog/Langdoc has a wider scope than Ethnologue in that we provide  
identifiers for all nodes, not only languages. This is similar to  
multitree.org.

Glottolog/Langdoc provides both classification and references, which the  
aforementioned projects do not do. In that respect, it is similar to OLAC.

Glottolog/Langdoc follows the principle of Linked Data, provides RDF, and  
is integrated into the Linguistic Linked Open Data Cloud  
http://linguistics.okfn.org/resources/llod/

Rosetta collects texts and documents, we collect references. We only have  
copies of 5% of our references.

this seems like a good idea. We have a trace of the original sources, so  
we could adjust the license according to provenance

What about using the Public Domain Mark[1]? If the organizations and
individuals involved in creating and hosting the dataset are known and
none of them claims copyright over the datayou are basically saying:
"This already IS public domain because no one has right sover this
data and thus no one can license it." That's what the PD mark is
intended to be used for.

Or have I misunderstood something? This might be a topic foprm
tomorrow's virtual meeting. Will you attend it, Karen?

I think the answer is that the rights are unknown or undeclared. PD 
obviously is a declaration. To designate something as PD one has to be 
the owner. But I will suggest that.

Hello,

the next virtual meeting is on tomorrow at 16:00 GMT. Please add
topics to the etherpad at
http://okfnpad.org/19th-open-bibliography-meeting

Unfortunately, Karen can't attend so we cannot continue the
interesting discussion about "orphan data sets".

@Sebastian: Will you be there to talk questions about your recently
published Langdoc dataset?

All the best

Hello,

Yes, I can confirm that we are part of the 3 year project called Europeana Awareness. Unfortunally, as yet, Europeana has published very little on the internet about it. This is really it:

http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness

http://pro.europeana.eu/web/europeana-awareness/project-partners

We have a little more information published on our part of the project, which entails organizing six GLAM-wiki conferences with Europeana material and/speakers, one Wiki loves public art contest across Europe, and writing a report on how the Wikimedia movement and the cultural institutions can work together. For these tasks we will hire a person for about 20 months. The hiring process is under way and is scheduled to end in about two weeks time. I will stay on as project manager for the Swedish chapter, but the real day-to-day work will be done by the employee.

Any help you may give with these tasks, is very much appreciated.

On the other hand, is there anything we can help you with? Can you for instance describe more in detail how you will reach your goal? How is the project laid out? And is there more information published anywhere that we can read?

I know only a little about the Europeana Foundation and its staff, but I can definitely work with you on that part, if that is what you're after.


Best wishes,



Lennart

Good morning List(s)!

A great new post has gone up on Open GLAM about the Mapping the Republic of
Letters project thanks to Nicole Coleman from Stanford.

Check it out here:

If anyone has got more ideas on interesting open source projects that use
bibliographical data drop me an email and I'll ask them!

Hi Tariq

As far as I know, there is currently no open alternative to CrossRef with
good coverage of the literature because the reference lists from papers are
in the main not open data and therefore can't be automatically discovered
and reused, although if D was open access then it might be possible.

There are certain projects looking to address this and make citation
networks of OA material e.g. http://opencitations.net/ and lots of interest
in encouraging publishers to make all of their reference/citation data open
to enable alternative services and novel uses of the data.

I'm copying in the open biblio mailing list who will be able to answer your
question far more authoritatively than I could!

Dear Tariq,

If D contained or published machine-readable RDF metadata, then the 
statement

    <D> cito:cites <P> .

and/or

    <P> cito:citedBy <D> .

would make the existence of the link discoverable within the world of 
linked data.  [For CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology, see 
http://purl.org/spar/cito/.]

Ideally, one would wish additionally for a ping-back / track-back 
mechanism whereby S could alert X automatically to the existence of D.  
The JISC WebTracks Project is addressing this - see 
http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/mrd/clip/webtracks.aspx and 
http://webtracks.jiscinvolve.org/wp/.  I am copying this to Brian 
Matthews, who can inform you of the current status of WebTracks.

Kind regards,

David

Hello,

I updated the about page[1] at openbiblio.net to have an online
description of what this working group is doing. The text now reads as
follows (see the web page for rich formatting and hyperlinks):

<quote>

This site is maintained by the Open Knowledge Foundation?s Working
Group on Open Bibliographic Data. It provides general information and
news about ongoing activities on matters related to open bibliographic
data (short: ?openbiblio?) and?open bibliographic projects.

The OKFN Working Group on Open Bibliographic Data has formulated the
Principles on Open Bibliographic Data?as a basic agreement for the
group?s work. Feel free to?endorsethese principles if you want to show
your approval and support of the group?s basic assumptions.

The working group covers different kinds of tasks and areas of
activity, including:

- Documentation.?Keep track of bibliographic datasets that become
available on the web, and their licenses. For this purpose the
?Bibliographic Data? group at the Data Hub?is maintained by members of
the working group.

- Information.?Provide information about relevant projects and
developments on this blog and asking openbiblio providers and other
people working on openbiblio-relevant projects to share their
experiences and knowledge.

- Support.?Assist people willing to publish data, e.g. in choosing the
right license, keeping an eye on possible legal problems or coping
with format issues. Assist dataset owners with finding suitable places
to deposit and store bibliographic data.

- Initiate.?Follow up with producers of bibliographic datasets,
introduce them to the Principles on Open Bibliographic Data and
request their endorsement, and any license adjustments that may
entail.

- Development.?Develop standards, interfaces and applications for
producing, sharing etc. open bibliographic data. There even is a
seperate?openbiblio-dev mailing list?for developers.

- Community Building.?Build a community of people endorsing the
openbiblio principles and sharing information on the mailing list, at
openbiblio.net etc.

The Working Group discusses topics in an open forum via the?Working
Group e-mail list?and the?archive?is available to all.

We are happy for any support in the described areas or for people
willing to translate the Principles on Open Bibliographic Data or
sharing their experience on this blog. If you want to join the
conversation and participate in openbiblio activities introduce
yourself on themailing list?or contact the working group?s coordinator
Adrian Pohl (adrian.pohl[at]okfn[dot]org).

</quote>

I hope this now makes clear what kind of activities the group is
involved in so that e.g. to people who might be willing to participate
in the working group's activities get a clue where they can add their
support.

What do you think about? Is this page helpful? Does this make you
wanting to contribute? ;-) Any corrections or additions?

All the best
Adrian

Hi adrian,

it's good, and yes it is helpful. Can we change the URL to /about rather
than /about-2 though? presumably there was an old /about page which is now
in trash and needs deleted in order to allow this.

========================================================================
SEMINAR: "Five Years On" (Library Linked Data)
  A DCMI-UK Regional Meeting
VENUE: The British Library, London
DATE: Friday, 27 April 2012
WEBSITE: http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/BibData/fyo

REGISTRATION OPEN:
http://dcevents.dublincore.org/index.php/BibData/fyo/about/registration
(***Limited to 70 participants***)

Meetings co-endorsed by DCMI and DCMI-Member JISC
========================================================================

This seminar marks five years of progress in library linked data since the
?London Meeting? of 2007 London Meeting of 31 April/1 May 2007 between DCMI
and Joint Steering Committee for the Development of RDA stimulated
significant development of Semantic Web representations of the major
international bibliographic metadata models, including IFLA?s Functional
Requirements family and the International Standard Bibliographic
Description (ISBD), and MARC as well as RDA itself. Attention is now
beginning to focus on the management and sustainability of this activity,
and the development of high-level semantic and data structures to support
library applications.
