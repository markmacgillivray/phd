   *Digital Research 2012*

 10-12 September 2012
 St Catherine?s College, Oxford, UK

  http://digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk

 Digital Research practice, tools and infrastructures have been embraced by
researchers across all disciplines. The landscape is changing rapidly, with
the Web as our research environment and also a lens onto our society and
world. Researchers across sciences and humanities are facing the
opportunities and challenges of new forms of data and big data analytics,
and harnessing the technological advances of new devices and
"e-Infrastructure" including High Performance Computing and the Cloud.

   *Digital Research 2012* features an exciting three-day programme with a
great set of speakers, bringing the community together to showcase today?s
digital research practice and innovation and set an influential agenda for
tomorrow. We welcome researchers, research technologists and developers at
all stages of their careers. Here are some highlights of the programme -
please see the website for the full programme and registration information:

 *New Science of New Data Symposium* and *Innovation Showcase* (Monday
10th).  Keynotes from social network analysis expert *Noshir
Contractor*(Northwestern University) on Web Science, government open
data director
*Nigel Shadbolt* on Open Data, and a closing address by philosopher,
computer scientist and political writer *Kieron O'Hara* - with twitter
analytics, geolocated social media and informational citizenship in
between.  Also the launch of the *Software Sustainability Institute's
Fellows Programme *and the community innovation showcase and workshops.

 *Future of Digital Research* (Tuesday 11th).  Keynotes from *Stevan
Harnad*on "Digital Research: How and Why the RCUK Open Access Policy
Needs to Be
Revised", *Jim Hendler* (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) on "Broad Data"
(not just big!), and *Lizbeth Goodman* (UCD) on "SMART spaces by and for
SMART people". Sessions are themed on Open Science (with a data publishing
panel), Smart Spaces as a Utility and future glimpses from the community,
all culminating in a Roundtable discussion on the Future of Digital
Research.

 *e?Infrastructure Forum* and *Innovation Showcase* (Wednesday 12th). We
open with a dual-track community innovation showcase, then launch the UK
e-Infrastructure Academic Community Forum where *Peter Coveney* (UK
e-Infrastructure Leadership Council and UCL) will present the "state of the
nation" followed by a Provider?s Panel, Software, Training and User?s Panel
- an important and timely opportunity for the community to review where we
are with the recent UK government investment and determine what's needed in
the future.

 It's free to attend just the *New Science of New Data* symposium or *Software
Sustainability Institute Fellows Programme* launch on Monday 10th, or
the *e-Infrastructure
Forum* on Wednesday 12th (thanks to our sponsors). Full 3-day registration
enables you to attend everything and there's a lot more happening
throughout the event, including an exciting "DevChallenge" hackathon run by
DevCSI, software surgery by SSI and multiple community workshops - plus the
Digital Research 2012 dinner in College and a reception in the
spectacular *Museum
of Natural History*. Please go to
http://digital-research.oerc.ox.ac.uk/registration to register.

   We're very grateful to everyone who has come together to make this event
possible, including e-Research South, Open Knowledge Foundation, Web
Science, the Digital Social Research programme, our Digital Economy
colleagues and the All Hands Foundation.

 We look forward to seeing you in Oxford 10-12th September to discuss the
state of the art and the shape of the future in Digital Research.

Dear all,

In Adrian's absence I'll again be hosting the Open Bibliography Working
Group call, tomorrow Tuesday 4th September at 16.00 BST (GMT+1).

Please log into the etherpad <
http://okfnpad.org/25th-open-bibliography-meeting> a couple of minutes
before and I'll call you on Skype (please add your Skype details to the
pad); please do also add your topics for discussion.

The agenda is currently empty, so anything goes! If you would like to join
the call just to see what's going on you would be most welcome.

That's great news, but is it really CC0 if it's behind an API with
Terms of Service use restrictions?  Is there a bulk download available
somewhere?
How does this data relate to the individual downloads made available
last year at http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/datasets ?  It doesn't
look like those have been updated since then, but are they now covered
by the CC0 license as well?

For those who want to short circuit the multiple levels of
clickthrough required, here are some links:

Hi Tom,

I understand your concerns and we have been debating these as well with
Europeana. It will probably not answer all your questions, but here is some
additional info:

- All of Europeana's metadata will be available as bulk download under the
CC0-waiver. This will be officially released in October on the datasets
page.  At the OKFest some of these will already be available to hack on.
- The API has a key on it yes. The API is being renewed however. When the
new API is released (which is also available next week at OKFest) there
will be far less restrictions and anybody can make use of a the API, in
that sense I do not see a problem in having a key.

It is now up to the dev community to experiment with the possibilities of
this CC0 release.  I personally think this is a great achievement for open
cultural data and will push more institutions towards opening up their data!

Best,

Joris

Good point Tom. I think the question is less whether or not the data
is released under CC0 (which it clearly is) and more whether it is
compliant with OpenDefinition.org - particularly point 4., "Absence of
Technological Restriction". Let's see what happens next week.

Dear Tom, 

 

To complement Joris's email, I would like to let you know that we are
still working at Europeana on the generation of new dumps for the page 
http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/datasets
<http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/datasets> . 

We will also update our documentation to reflect the changes. In the
meantime you can still experiment with the subset of CC0 data available
at http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/datasets
<http://pro.europeana.eu/web/guest/datasets> . 

 

Best wishes, 

 

Valentine

Thanks very much for the updates Jori, Jonathan, & Valentine.  It sounds
like the future situation will be great, so I just need to wait a little
while longer.

Unfortunately, intercontinental travel just for a hackathon isn't really an
option for me, so I won't be able to get all the early access benes being
offered to attendees, but hopefully it won't be too much later that they're
generally available.

There are still spaces left for Future Citations Hack Days, on
September 27 and 28, 2012 in Birmingham, UK.

This is a FREE event (includes accommodation and food) for software
developers and experts who are interested in the area of Citation
Data.

More information about the event (including and a booking form) can be
found here:

http://goo.gl/z9sVo

This event has been organised by the Developer Community Supporting
Innovation Project (DevCSI-http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk) and the JISC
Citation Data directions project. It will bring together software
developers, project managers, and experts in the area of Citation Data
Analysis, areas of interest include:

- Business Intelligence
- Research management
- Novel use cases

We will help people come together to form small teams/groups (these
can be formed before the event), to discuss issues, work on paper/real
prototypes, datasets, APIs. All participants will be able to share
their own examples, expertise and opinions via the lightning sessions,
discussions and informal networking opportunities.

The event will culminate in a series of presentations from the teams,
in terms of the work they have carried out.

Please visit the Future Citation Data ideas page:

http://goo.gl/QlZkZ

for the ideas people are interested in

If you can't make it, please feel free to pass on the details you know
who might benefit from it.

At OKFest we had a very successful hackathon looking at what we could
extract from bibliographic data. Michael Bauer (copied) trawled the
BioMedCentral site and has extracted a large amount of bibdata. We plan to
put this in Bibserver.

One idea that we want to do is create ids for each institution mentioned in
the author list, based on the text, e.g.

Unilever Centre, Dep. Of Chemistry
University of Cambridge
CB2 1EW, UK

This would allow us to create facets for institutions, create a list and
browse using Bibserver. (Although we cannot formally uniquify, this is a
much easier problem than authors.

Laurent - I came across GROBID and am keen to re-use, rather than reinvent.

Perhaps we should form an informal group in this technology and coordinate
some of our efforts?

He has already done so, which brought up some issues I am resolving as part
of a re-design anyway. Should be done next week.

Actually we can facet without identifiers. It can be done directly on the
name string. Identifiers just provide us a way to connect different names
for the same thing, but the problem is still the same - we need to identify
that two things are the same in the first place.

I mentioned what we were doing when at UKPMC yesterday and there was

Just to pop in,

The best practice I ever picked up (besides unit testing) from working
with software engineers was to create really concrete user stories,
and focus on stripping the story down to its core elements.  This has
saved me from major architectural backtracking a few times, as I have
a natural tendency towards over-engineering.

We have a concrete user story here, although it has been created by the
hackathon attendees on the basis that they understand users!

But in this area we are generally building to meet anticipated demand
rather than reacting to existing demand.

I think it would be a very good idea to do so. 
Cheers,
Laurent (disappearing 2 days in a review panel on research infrastructures.... I'll keep an eye on data openness)

BTW, we generate TEI encoded data from PDFs, with deep name and affiliation (TEI based) structures which could be taken , e.g.
