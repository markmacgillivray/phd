Dear Open Data friends,
 
I put a text for an Open Data flyer into the OKFN wiki which we created at the hbz (in German): http://wiki.okfn.org/Entwurf%20eines%20Flyers%20zu%20Freien%20Katalogdaten
 
I know there are some German speaking persons on this list (perhaps even some native English speakers with German skills). The next task is - besides adding some arguments while keeping the text short - to translate this draft into english. I've already created a wiki page for the English version: http://wiki.okfn.org/Open%20Bibliographic%20Data%20Flyer
So, everybody is invited to help creating a good, simple and short text (at best in multiple languages) about the benefits of Open Bibliographic Data.

This looks very interesting. I wonder whether/how the project
currently supports sharing reference/citation data?

David: do you know whether there are any plans to encourage
institutions/researchers to open up reference data? Or anything about
the IPR management model? Seems like potentially a big opportunity to
share citation data more effectively...

All the best,

Jonathan

News release
17 May 2010

Referencing made easy

A new piece of software to help students and universities manage
academic references more easily has been developed by the Open
University and its partners.

Funded by JISC, and made in collaboration with RefWorks, the web-based
research management, writing and collaboration tool, the OU has
developed MyReferences to simplify referencing.

Lawrie Phipps, programme manager at JISC, said: ?Writing up references
can be a really time-consuming activity for the student and researcher
? but it?s essential to avoid plagiarism, develop robust scholarship
and lead the reader to other relevant work. ?This resource is one
aspect of a huge investment from JISC which aims to spark innovative
solutions to issues like referencing that affect people working up and
down the country, in order to inspire and help other UK colleges and
universities.?

MyReferences integrates tools from the widely-used RefWorks reference
management software into the Moodle virtual learning environment which
is used in academic institutions across the UK to support online
learning.

Nicky Whitsed, director of library services at the OU, said: ?For
students, this means helping them to adopt good practice in organising
and managing references and using citations appropriately in their
work. And for universities this new and easy reference management
system will help to tackle plagiarism by making referencing easier;
encourage information literacy; and help libraries to improve
reference management for courses?.

The MyReferences software is open source, making it free for any
institution to download, tailor to their own needs and integrate into
their own learning environments.

The software is part of the 'technology enhanced learning supporting
students to achieve academic rigour' (TELSTAR) project. ?Owen
Stephens, project manager, said: ?These new tools are invaluable to
the 21st century educational institution and student. There is an ever
increasing wealth of resources available and hence a real need for
students, course and programme teams to be able to create, manipulate,
organise and store a range of citations and bibliographic references
for easy use."

There are already a number of general referencing tools available to
students, but MyReferences takes the usability of these tools a step
further by integrating them into online courses so the materials
students commonly need to reference are already available in the
format they need. Students simply select the sources they need to
reference, the referencing style their institution requires and then
copy and paste the result into their assignment.

Owen continued: ?From now until July we?ll be working with other
institutions to implement the software, as well as continuing to pilot
it with staff and students at the OU. The response we?ve had so far
from students and staff alike has been overwhelmingly positive and
we?re looking forward to working with more and more organisations in
the UK and across the world to spread the benefits of this new
referencing tool.?

"RefWorks is proud to be a part of the MyReferences project ? it not
only provides users with an effective and easy-to-use research
management tool, but it takes another step towards educating them
about information literacy,? said Colleen Stempien, executive director
of operations, RefWorks-COS. ??Any institution that currently
subscribes to RefWorks may easily adapt the added Moodle integration
functionality using the RefWorks API.?

EPrints 3.2.1 is to be released this week, which exposes the contents of 
repositories as linked data. (discoverable via, robots.txt, sitemap.xml 
& voID etc.)

I'm sure we'll find many flaws when/if people start consuming the data, 
but you can have a look live on
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/id/repository (warning, big XML file)

Example of a single record:
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/export/eprint/12314/RDFXML/ecs-eprint-12314.rdf

Hopefully many repositories will upgrade to 3.2.1 over the next few 
months, providing a wealth of linked bibliographic data.

It's through Refworks, which means you need a subscription: paid for by
many university libraries, but not open to the general public without
payment.

Hi - I'm the project manager for this JISC project

As Graham says, the work we have done integrates RefWorks, a commercial product, with Moodle (which is Open Source). In terms of sharing reference data RefWorks supports publication of references via RSS (something we made use of in the project), and we also developed tools to enable the sharing of references within the Moodle environment by enabling the embedding of an XML representation of the reference into any page, which would then be presented in a human-readable format, with options to export to a variety of formats.

While the project developed these specific tools, it also took a wider look at the area of referencing. In terms of sharing Reference/Citation data in an open format, we looked at RDFa and the Bibliontology, although we didn't use this approach in the end I think this is certainly promising as a mechanism and would love to see it more widely adopted. We also ran an event in January this year which included presentations from Mendeley, Connotea and CiteULike - all of which look at mechanisms for sharing bibliographic data online. We've tried to bring together many of the issues we encountered.

Our upcoming event 'Innovations in Reference Management 2' is scheduled for June 21st in Birmingham UK - it may be of interest to some of this list http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/telstar/2010/05/11/innovations-in-reference-management-2/

Many of the issues we encountered and the solutions we implemented are documented in the draft 'toolkit' (ReMIT) at http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/telstar/remit-toc/ - we are still interested in feedback on this and hope to revise it before a final version is published before the end of the project in July, so if there are any comments please feel free to add them to the toolkit, or send them to me. At the moment there isn't much in there on sharing/publishing reference data so it would be good to know what people might look for in such a toolkit.

Thanks,

Owen

This does not appear to be a step towards open biblio data: this is some promotion of 
RefWorks, a proprietary reference management system which functions by enclosure,
restriction, repackaging and licensing of open biblio data.

I have to disagree with this. The project was not about open bibliographic data per se, but we did consider issues around sharing of bibliographic data between staff and students with a focus on how this might happen in an online learning environment. See my previous post for more on this.

Additionally I really can't see how RefWorks restricts or licenses open bibliographic data?

That's some impressive marketing by the RefWorks team.  Not only do
they get their customers to pony up subscription fees, but also get
them to use public grant money to integrate, then promote, the
RefWorks subscription service.

Audacious!  You've gotta respect 'em even if you don't agree with what
they're doing.

Understood that your project was not set up to promote open bibliographic data.
My point is that it appears to have the effect of providing good bibliographic services to  RefWorks
institutional customers while not promoting open bibliographic data.
MyReferences appears to promote not open sharing, but closed sharing, where both 
the data sharing capability and the data itself are made available only to individuals at 
institutions which have RefWorks subscriptions.

Hi,

neat, looks like someone (Claire?) completed the translation! This is just
to make sure that you also feel free (or rather urged ;-) to correct my
stammering in the first two paragraphs. I've used http://dict.leo.org/ quite
a lot, as native speakers have undoubtedly noticed...

Cheers,

Felix

This all looks really good! It may also be worth borrowing from the
"Response to Working Group on the Future of Bibliographic Control
(Library of Congress)" document which we helped draft back in late
2007: <http://wiki.okfn.org/FutureOfBibliographicControl>

For example:

<quote>
Bibliographic records are a key part of our shared cultural heritage.
They too should therefore be made available to the public for access
and re-use without restriction. Not only will this allow libraries to
share records more efficiently and improve quality more rapidly
through better, easier feedback, but will also make possible more
advanced online sites for book-lovers, easier analysis by social
scientists, interesting visualizations and summary statistics by
journalists and others, as well as many other possibilities we cannot
predict in advance.

Government agencies and public institutions are increasingly making
data open. We strongly encourage [...] [libraries] to join this
movement by recommending that more bibliographic data is made
available for access, re-use and re-distribution without restriction.

Regards,

Rufus

Thanks Jim,

In terms of the open vs closed sharing - while the 'MyReferences' tool we have developed makes use of RefWorks, much of the functionality we have developed does not rely on RefWorks as such. For example we support the idea of sharing references in any 'collaborative activity' in Moodle - this entails inserting an xml representation of the reference into Moodle forums/blogs/wikis and enabling functionality (such as 'export this reference'). None of this is tied to RefWorks. I would like to see some improvements in this area - for example it would have been nicer if we had been able to use RDFa and Bibliontology instead of an arbitrary xml representation - however I explain the reasons this didn't happen in my comment on this post http://ukwebfocus.wordpress.com/2010/03/25/microformats-and-rdfa/#comments

So while the sharing mechanism is limited to the Moodle environment - which I agree is not ideal - it is not tied to any commercial software. 

In terms of the RefWorks T&C, your interpretation differs from mine, and the one implicitly supported by RefWorks. I believe the line you quote is about the use of the system, not the data stored in the system. I interpret the line to mean that we are unable to resell (or otherwise offer) the RefWorks service/software to others outside our organisation. However I do not believe this extends in any way to the bibliographic data stored in the system, and none of our discussions with RefWorks have indicated this is the case. As RefWorks supports the open publication of bibliographies as RSS (with the reference included as xml) it would seem that they do not intend your interpretation of the T&C either. 

Finally I'd like to re-emphasise that although the MyReferences tool was the focus of the press release - perhaps being the most tangible output - it is not the sole focus of the project. Particularly for this list I would highlight the section on "Copyright, Intellectual Property Rights, Licensing and Reference Management". This brief section highlights some of the issues to consider, and quotes the recent JISC report on the Transport and Use of Bibliographic Records (http://www.jisclegal.ac.uk/Projects/TransferandUseofBibliographicRecords/TheBasics/Legalconstraints.aspx) in terms of reuse of bibliographic data. What would be really valuable to the project is any suggestions of how this section might be improved, or if there are issues currently missed completely - input from those on this list would be especially welcome.

Best wishes,

Owen

I have made just one minor change to the second paragraph: from "...means to
consistently continuate" to "...is the logical continuation of" (for
"konsequent fortf?hren") - although this is not a literal translation
"logical" sounds a bit better to me than "consistent" in this context, it is
a tricky phrase to translate into English without sounding tautologous!

I do use LEO quite a lot as well ;)

Jim provided a link to the full T&Cs, but for those who didn't follow
the link and are trying to form an opinion whether RefWorks data could
be reused in any remotely "open" context, consider:

"RefShare allows for viewing of shared data, by individuals outside of
a university or institution, subject to the following limitations:
(1) 30,000 records per database, and (2) maximum of 1,000 accesses
(hits) per month per shared database or folder.  Usage in excess of
these limits requires RefWorks-COS? advance written permission and may
require the payment of additional fees."

Since there's no practical way to meter accesses outside of a closed
system, this effectively means that the data can not be reused outside
of the customer university.  At least that's my reading of it.  If one
were to find a way to satisfy or avoid this clause, you'd have a whole
additional round of due diligence to do with the database providers
because of:

"Customer must bear in mind that the Service allows downloading,
sharing and storing of information from bibliographic databases and
other sources that may be copyright protected. Customer should check
with the appropriate database provider(s) to ensure compliance with
any restrictions such provider(s) may impose."

If RefWorks really does intend the data to be reused, they should
change their license agreement to reflect that intent.

Bibliographica, an Introduction
<http://blog.okfn.org/2010/05/20/bibliographica-an-introduction/>
May 20th, 2010

It's time to talk a bit about Bibliographica
<http://bibliographica.org/>, a new project of the Open Knowledge
Foundation.
Bibliographica is designed to make it easier for scholars and
researchers to share and collect information about work in their field.
It provides an open source software platform to create and share
semantically rich information about publications, authors and their works.

As readers of the Open Knowledge Foundation blog will know we have a
long-standing interest in open bibliographic data - from our efforts
starting in 2005 to build a database of public domain works
<http://www.publicdomainworks.net/>, our coordination of the response to
the Library of Congress' Future of Bibliographic Control (2007)
<http://blog.okfn.org/2007/12/19/response-to-the-future-of-bibliographic-control-draft-from-the-library-of-congress/> and
the recent creation of a new working group
<http://blog.okfn.org/2010/03/03/new-working-group-on-open-bibliographic-data/> onopen
bibliographic data <http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography> in March this
year.

I had not considered the problem in those terms. I have to think a bit
on how far we would get using aggregates as defined by the ORE
vocabulary (which I found by looking at http://escape.utwente.nl/).
Nevertheless "a tool to make machine (and human!) readable aggregates"
succinctly describes what we are hoping to accomplish.

The possibilities are boundless but the almost all user interfaces we
have for linked data are rubbish (ours included, but one of our goals is
to make advances in this area). To an extent I agree it is a question of
awareness -- if the talented user interface developers were aware of
linked data we'd have better interfaces. Even publishers and libraries
that are clued about linked data don't have a piece of software they can
install for the researchers to use. Researchers have no useful browser
even if they are sufficiently motivated to write their own RDF by hand
with a text editor.

I wasn't aware of INTUTE myself nor of their funding status. It seems to
be a project of MIMAS which themselves are not likely to go away any
time soon.

None that I know of.

I don't doubt that the INTUTE site would be better if it contained
richly interlinked data, and better still if the sites it references
provided such data and there were some way to see it. To the extent to
which we succeed in making a useful tool for visualising and editing
linked data, it is free software and I'm sure we would be happy to help
INTUTE use it. On an implementation level our concept of "bibliographic
data" is wide enough that it could include statements about websites.

A key next step for us after this development cycle is going to be
recruiting communities  of researchers to adopt and improve materials
relating to their areas of interest - in particular making (RDF)
statements about books and works and papers that wouldn't normally be
found in a library catalogue. Anything we can learn from INTUTE would be
useful, I would be happy to hear from them.

Incidentally, I notice that http://escape.utwente.nl/ mentions the
faculty of law at the top of the page -- this area is  interesting to me
because of the depth of references and dialogue between the judiciary
and legislature particularly in countries with a common-law tradition.
Can we turn the statute and case-law books into linked data?

Cheers,
-w

Subject: [open-bibliography] openbiblio/ordf source code and documentation
Message-ID: <4BF93A66.9020406@okfn.org>

Hi all,

There have been a few requests for source code and such, so writing here
to clarify. Firstly, please be aware that this is software under heavy
development
and there are no guarantees of stability of either form or function.
That said,
any feedback, collaboration, patches, etc. are most welcome.

The core bits are in a python library called ORDF. The source code is in the
mercurial repository at http://knowledgeforge.net/pdw/ordf . This also
contains
the javascript that is used to make the http://bibliographica.org/
website. This
is generic machinery for displaying, editing and indexing RDF and is not
specific to bibliographic data.

There is also some documentation at  http://bibliographica.org/docs/ordf the
first two chapters of which (on some design considerations and use of N3 and
the lens metaphor) which may be of interest generally. The balance of the
ORDF docs are more technical dealing with the software itself.

The web application that runs on http://bibliographica.org/ is available
in the
mercurial repository at http://knowledgeforge.net/pdw/openbiblio this builds
on ORDF and contains the bits that are specific to bibliographic data --
actually not much at the present juncture.

Cheers,
-w

William, et al -

I took a quick look at some of the data, and there are what I would  
consider some errors that should be corrected. As an example, FRBR  
"manifestation" is not a resource type -- but text is. (Any  
manifestation has inherent in it the two FRBR levels Work and  
Expression, so there really isn't any such thing as a Manifestation on  
its own.) Also note that IFLA has registered FRBR provisionally at  
http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/5.html. What it lacks at  
the moment is an official URI (they are quibbling about the domain  
name), but I can let you know when that happens. The IFLA version of  
FRBR in RDF should be considered the authoritative one.

Also, the Metadata Registry has RDF properties for hundreds of  
bibliographic fields. I could help identify the ones needed for  
Bibliographica if you'd like.

I am not sure that this will fly, honestly, and I would be hard pressed to
think that the world will respect IFLA's desire here, esp. since
vocab.org/frbr/core predates it by about five years.

Also, this: http://metadataregistry.org/schemaprop/show/id/1565.html makes
me think that it's perfectly valid to use <uri> <rdf:type>
<frbr:Manifestation> .  After all, if the only data you have is
manifestation level, it's not possible to (or necessary) to define the work
or expression.  That's the benefit of the open world model, somebody else
can fill in those parts you don't currently know.

I think you're absolutely right. Most of the data that's in there at the
moment -- and expect it to be trashed and re-done -- comes from the
Gutenberg MARC dump. As I understand it, what we typically find in MARC
files equates to a Manifestation (and some author/editor data). What we
haven't done yet is infer Expression and Work from the Manifestation.
Looking at the literature a bit it seems like this is a bit problematic;
I think WorldCat tried a few years ago and ended up suggesting that
Expression be removed and just add some extra data to Manifestation. In
any event the data in there are incomplete.

Interesting. I wonder why they wouldn't just adopt the existing
namespace. Their URIs are also funny.

regardless of namespace, it's not nice to give your classes numbers
instead of names.

In any event it's not a bit deal to use owl:sameAs (or equivalentClass)
and infer extra types to keep compatibility.

This would be most helpful. Have you read the bit in the documentation
about using "lenses" with the Fresnel vocabulary (like "views") for
visualisation? A lot of the work is going to be in creating those, and
they're used both for editing and viewing.

That said, we run into a hard problem here. This is not intended to be a
catalogue maintained by trained librarians but by researchers and
scholars in other fields. How much do we require them to understand the
FRBR conceptual model? For example, if they have just read Leopold
Auer's "Violin Playing as I Teach it" and want to make an annotation to
the effect that a particular chapter contains some good insight into the
expression of Bach's Chaconne, do they make this annotation in reference
to the Work, Expression, Manifestation? I suspect that for both subject
and object they would use the respective Work. I also suspect that they
would be wont to put it elsewhere and couldn't be bothered with
understanding FRBR's distinctions. On the other hand if someone want's
to say that X's translation into Estonian of "100 Years of Solitude" is
particularly bad, this type of statement goes at the Expression level.
But will they know that without help? I'm not sure how to handle this
sort of thing from a user interface perspective.

Well, they *are* the developers of FRBR, so in a sense the FRBR  
namespace should be decided by IFLA, since they will be the ones  
maintaining the definitions. If you look at what is in the metadata  
registry, you will see that FRBR has evolved since the vocab project  
defined it, and it would be best to use the one that is the most up to  
date.

That's one of those religious questions :-). Some folks think that  
using names is not nice because it isn't language neutral. You'll find  
arguments no matter which method you use. For RDA properties, the RDA  
folks did decide that they wanted language-based URIs, and they've  
ended up with things like:

http://rdvocab.info/Elements/configurationOfPlaybackChannelsManifestation
http://rdvocab.info/Elements/otherDistinguishingCharacteristicOfTheExpression

Those make numbers look good.

No, but I will. And I'll think about it all, see what ideas I can come  
up with.

... snip...

Given that even the developers of RDA can't seem to agree on what  
elements are valid for what FRBR levels, I think it would be best to  
skip FRBR altogether in the user view, and to let the data elements  
themselves carry the connection to the WEMI entities. There are not  
that many properties that can be associated with more than one level  
(at least not many that a simple catalog would use -- the majority of  
the multi-level properties are associated with both Manifestation and  
Item, and that is in support of the archival community's cataloging),  
and I think it's legitimate to choose to associate each property with  
a single FRBR level as a way to simplify the (overly complex) model.  
Subjects are associated only with the work in FRBR; language of text  
is associated with the expression; dates of publication and publishers  
with the Manifestation. FRBR would treat reviews or comments as  
separate works linked to the entity being reviewed.

So in response to Ross's comment:

> After all, if the only data you have is
manifestation level, it's not possible to (or necessary) to define the work
or expression.  That's the benefit of the open world model, somebody else
can fill in those parts you don't currently know.

... in fact, a Manifestation level record would have no creator and no  
subjects, also no language of text. FRBR, IMO, is a huge mess the way  
that it is actually written, and I am determined to find a way to make  
it more useful for real life applications. But the fact is that a  
"normal" bib record with author, title, publisher, subjects, is a  
mixture of WEM. There really is no such thing as a Manifestation  
record without WE. So that's why I feel like putting Manifestation as  
a type on the records is incorrect and could in the long wrong create  
more confusion (than FRBR already does on its own).

  On the other hand if someone wants

You are right that this should be at the Expression level, but I  
despair of ever having WEMI understood by the general Internet  
population when even catalogers are struggling with it. You are also  
right that if there is going to be any understanding of it, the UI is  
key. I'm fairly comfortable with the choice made by Open Library to  
develop Work entities, and to combine Expressions and Manifestations  
as a single entity. For texts, the Expression has few properties, the  
primary one being language/translation. It is possible that if we use  
the role properties (such that author, translator, conductor, director  
would be roles that link an Agent to a resource), we can determine  
that certain roles are Work level and others are Expression level, and  
we can possibly infer expressions. But how to get that note pointing  
to the Expression and not the Manifestation or Work... I'm not at all  
sure about that.

William, I'm about to do another blog post on FRBR about reusability,  
but what it comes down to for me is that the Group1 entities are  
really a single entity with subparts. I have only minor quibbles with  
Groups 2 & 3. The main problem with Group 1 is that the entities are  
interdependent and cannot exist without each other, which to me makes  
them "not-entities" but parts of some whole. You have to keep in mind  
that the folks who developed FRBR have no experience with data  
definition and thought they were creating something designed for a  
relational database (but I have proof that most of them have never  
created a database of any kind in real life). Keeping in mind that  
FRBR is a conceptual model (and possibly not a great one), we should  
feel free to make it work better rather than follow it slavishly.  
Which is why I would prefer to not make any reference to FRBR in the  
UI, but to make use of it in the background if it turns out to make  
sense to do so.

It's not a simple model, like many things in the bibliographic world it has to deal with some rather complex and abstract ideas.

I believe FRBR could be made much more useful by tying it in with a more real-world view - perhaps relating it to other vocabularies in RDA, DC etc.

I proposed an alternative model here: <http://dynamicorange.com/2009/11/11/bringing-frbr-down-to-earth/>

What I suggest in that post is not an alternative to FRBR but an evolution, making it more concrete and adding more relations to it.

I couldn't agree with you more Karen! I've not got a biblio background
but I have been working with bibliographic data pretty heavily over
the last couple of years (see
<http://www.rufuspollock.org/tags/eupd/>)

I've been trying to understand / implement FRBR and have constantly
felt the domain model here is poorly thought out especially in now it
relates to non-book media (e.g. recordings). As a concrete example:
still can't work out where you distinguish a "work" from an
"expression" -- e.g. is this new translation of Shakespeare's Hamlet
into French a new expression or a new work and how to I associate it
to Shakespeare's Hamlet work/expression ...)

My feeling is that FRBR has confused associative relationships (e.g.
derived from) with a hierarchy (inclusion/subpart) structure -- the
classic example is indicating derived relationships, say between a
translation and the original which I think should be an explicit
"derived-from" relationship rather than getting shoe-horned into an
expression-work type setup as it seems to be (though pardon me if i
have misunderstood).

For me, the core useful part of FRBR (at least as compared to what
seems to happen in most current catalogues) is the distinction between
a

  * "work (/expression)": the artefact in abstract semi-platonic form)
  * "manifestation (/item)": something concrete e.g. book with an isbn
/ a (set) of recordings on a CD etc (of course it is useful to
distinguish, as FRBR does, between the individual item and the set of
all such items e.g. the print-run as represented by the ISBN).

Thus, I'd like to see FRBR pared back to a Work-Manifestation core
(perhaps with Item as an extra) together with a good set of properties
to express relationships between works e.g.:

  * is-derived-from (with subclasses such as translation, performance-of etc)
    * I note most of these properties are in something like
http://vocab.org/frbr/core.html but generally attached to
expression-work relation not work-work relation
  * is-part-of (for series, sets etc etc)

Some stripped down examples of trying to apply FRBR from my experience
can be found here: <http://wiki.okfn.org/p/Bibliographica/FRBR>

Regards,

Rufus

PS: I would also that this distinction would work well for a mapping
to copyright/public domain considerations (central to the EUPD project
I worked on): a Work would be something accruing a new copyright (I'm
ignoring "print-setting" copyright here). For more on the gory details
of doing PD status computation using FRBR-type concepts see:

Come on ! It's a "cultural convention" proposed by FRBR. Mutatis mutandis, as we "agreed" to
consider the main creator of a movie the director and not the screenwriter.

To make the distinction between work and expression, my rule of thumb is: who claims rights. If only
the creator of the derived entity claims copyright, then it is a new work. If the creator of the
"source" entity claims also some rights to the derived entity, it is a new expression. Sometimes
works :-)

I do the same with tangible entities. I do not see much use for "expression" in the "Mona Lisa"
case. But for texts, music ...

I agree. The more I work with FRBR, try to understand it, and consider its possible uses with organizations outside of libraries, it seems increasingly useless. I cannot imagine that anyone outside of libraries would ever consider implementing it because it bears little relation to their work and needs, and they certainly wouldn't do it on the "authority" of librarians.

I view FRBR as a theoretical framework that attempts to continue an idea concerning the structure of information and how people access it as it was seen among Anglo-centric librarians of the 19th-century. Traditionally, the "work" and "expression" were merely points of collation in the catalog, be it printed, card, or later OPAC, where people who browsed could find the records collected together in certain ways. The actual utility of e.g. the uniform title was questioned by many (how many readers need to know all of the translations in all of the languages and all of the variants of Homer's Iliad?) and uniform titles for series was even abandoned by LC a few years ago. 

The expression, also merely a point of collation in the catalog, was at least seen of more use (lots of people want to know of all the different English translations of the Iliad). Still, it is important to keep in mind that what they were doing was *arranging cards* (i.e. manifestation records) in a card catalog (or in a printed catalog). They would create a card for an item (i.e. manifestation) and the cataloger had to put it into the catalog somewhere. They were not creating "work records" or "expression records". They made records for real things and arranged them. Different catalogs could be arranged in all kinds of ways. Certainly not all of them were arranged by WEMI principles.

So, one of my theoretical problems is that FRBR has taken what had been mere organizational points for cards in a traditional catalog, and transmuted them into strange things called "entities" that have all kinds of attributes. The result is a lot of extra work as we have to scurry around to create records for these things called "works" and "expressions" and find all of these attributes that are of only passing curiosity--if that. 

What is even more curious is that the underlying purpose of all of this is to continue a 19th-century view of information organization and retrieval.

It just doesn't make much sense to me. I think there are far more interesting and productive ways to go.

Yes, I've maintained that WEMI are relationships, not THINGS. (Or as  
Dan Brickley said to me: FRBR has too many nouns, not enough verbs.)  
But that still doesn't solve the problem of what the THING is that  
relates...

I have to think about this some, but it might work. The other aspect  
of FRBR that bugs me is that it doesn't really address functionality.  
For example, although there is the theoretical level of Expression  
that for texts is necessary to describe the language of the text, in  
practice the use of a language facet in library systems seems to work  
quite well. I'd rather present facets than force a user through  
hierarchical levels when navigating the catalog. WEMI is very awkward  
as a structure, and, as I've said before, the dependency between the  
entities forces you to create them even if you have little or no use  
for the data they hold.

What I have been trying to work out is a way to use the FRBR  
properties without having to put them into separate WEMI structures.  
Something tells me it should work -- that we could have a set of data  
elements that can be independent of each other, and that can be  
selected and recombined as desired. I'll keep struggling with that.

right.  I realize, understand (and part of me even sympathizes with) the
librarian argument for attributes with no baked in semantic meaning, but
that fact of that matter is that the semantic web (hell, the web, period,
from HTML, XML, RDF, programming languages, etc.) is built on readable
labels and, to date, the language of those labels has been English (although
there is some disagreement as to *which* English).  That battle is lost.  If
IFLA is going to use the most obtuse language and identifiers imaginable to
define FRBR, the actual practitioners of the web will use the
vocab.org/frbr/core vocabulary, not IFLA's.

Also, going back to RDA's arcane property names -- one of the reasons they
are so awful is because they are trying to do too much.  They are implicitly
making more than one statement at a time.  There is no need for
configurationOfPlaybackChannelsManifestation and
configurationOfPlaybackChannelsExpression (etc.) because you should only be
asserting this to the resource at hand (i.e. the Manifestation or the
Expression).  All you need is "configurationOfPlaybackChannels" (whatever
the hell that means).  By having an
"otherDistinguishingCharacteristicOfTheExpression" predicate on something
that is really, say, a manifestation, you are saying two things, only one
that is really about the thing that you are talking about (which is, this
thing has an Expression, but not actually what it is.  The other assertion
-- otherDistinguishingCharacteristic -- should actually be asserted on the
Expression).

I don't disagree with your point.  However, if all we have is what is really
more or less a manifestation with subjects, creators, etc. and not really
enough definitive information to effectively define a work or an expression,
I think you just have to model what you've got.

And they'll already be out of date, unless someone updates vocab.org, 
which would be a good idea. The IFLA registered properties include the 
attributes and relationship properties, while vocab.org is just the 
'core' as it says here. In some cases care will be enough, but it's not 
all of FRBR.

You wouldn't believe what a religious war that is! But before getting 
into that, one needs to contemplate the difference between RDF and other 
data declarations. In RDF, you cannot redefine a property by placing it 
in a hierarchy, as you can with, say, XML. In RDF, the properties belong 
to a class (say a FRBR entity) and they belong to that class no matter 
where they are placed in relation to other properties. So (to use an 
easier example) Title of the Work is defined as being of class Work. 
Title proper is defined as being of class Manifestation. You cannot 
redefine their class in a usage. In fact, it works in the opposite way 
-- if you declare Title proper to be a property of some resource, that 
resource "inherits" the class Expression by definition. Jon Phipps 
explains this well, and I had hoped that he had done a blog post on it 
but I can't find one. If you run into him, ask him for his explanation. 
Essentially he will tell you that you have described how things work in 
XML, but that is not true in RDF.

That said, for the RDA folks it is imperative (religiously so) that each 
RDA property be associated with one and only one FRBR entity. I can't 
explain why, but they feel very strongly about it. Essentially, if you 
use a property with a different FRBR entity than the one they have 
defined, then you aren't doing RDA. So you may notice that for every one 
of those gawd-awful RDA properties in the Registry there is also a 
property that is "classless" -- and that property can be used in a 
situation that does not conform to RDA's assertion of FRBR.

HMMM. I don't know how else to say this, but if you have subjects and 
creators you have a mix of Work and Manifestation, and by inference 
Expression. This is why forcing things into a FRBR *structure* is such a 
bad idea -- most people aren't going to be thinking that adding subjects 
means that they've added Work-level properties. And this is why I'm 
trying to figure out a way that we can create data any which way and 
still consider subjects to be part of the Work in those situations where 
it matters. I think we can do this by assigning the properties to their 
appropriate classes, and let the "classness" carry the FRBR entities, 
not some record structure.

Actually, if this is what Jon said, I hate to say it, but Jon's wrong (or
this is being taken out of context).  Yes, if a particular attribute has a
particular FRBR entity as its domain or range, then indeed, using that
property will infer that the object or subject is the entity that it's
associated with.  However, if the domain or range is left open (like current
properties are, as I understand it), then this issue is moot - you use
dcterms:title or rda:titleProper or something on a manifestation and say
it's part of an expression (which has its own dcterms:title/rda:titleProper
assertions), etc.  The relationships between FRBR entities then becomes
optional.  If there is not enough data to describe the WEMI chain, don't.

You should definitely get Jon's explanation... I won't claim to have

That's what the "general" attributes are for at the RDA registry. So you 
can grab properties from there without having them balled up with the 
WEMI entities. But in that case, it's best not to claim that your 
record/data represents a particular FRBR entity... it's best to ignore 
FRBR altogether, as most people do (and get along just fine without it).

But the idea behind FRBR isn't necessarily something that should just be
thrown away because it's complicated or we don't have all of the facts at
hand to completely fill out the model.  Perhaps it would be better to look
at this with some "frbr" (lowercase, as opposed to "FRBR") like vocabulary
(perhaps the one that Rob has kicked around or something like that) that
maintains the sorts of relationships that we need from FRBR (work group
sets, translations, adaptations, etc.) without getting sucked into the void
that FRBR(tm) insists upon.  Possibly the vocab.org frbr or Rob's concept
(or something new) could work as a "vernacular FRBR" that a non-librarian
could actually hope to implement and use.

Subject: [open-bibliography] My FRBR shareable units
Message-ID: <20100526085422.9xblr5wgow8okcg8@kcoyle.net>

Following up on the previous discussion, I did a blog post on how I  
see the "sharable units" in a FRBR world:

http://kcoyle.blogspot.com/2010/05/frbr-and-sharability.html

Some of it seems quite obvious, but what I think we've run into is a  
difference between how FRBR defines its entities vs. what is the  
actual workable unit. So when people say "Manifestation" they are  
probably NOT referring to the FRBR Manifestation entity, but to a  
bibliographic description that includes the Work, Expression and  
Manifestation properties, as well as the links from Groups 2 & 3 to  
the Work entity.

I still see some inconsistencies in FRBR -- like the fact that  
although you can create a Corporate Body entity for a publisher and  
use a relationship "publisher of" to a Manifestation, the  
Manifestation includes a property for publisher name; but the Work  
does not include a property for creator name. I would really like to  
see these inconsistencies cleared up -- it would make it easier to  
model a FRBR bibliographic universe.

I think I would feel much more confident about FRBR's 
Work/Expression/Manifestation/Item model if there was a robust set of 
examples of each level in the model.

The best I could find is

    * *the work*, a distinct intellectual or artistic creation
    * *the expression*, the intellectual or artistic realization of a work
    * *the manifestation*, the physical embodiment of an expression of a
      work
    * *the item*, a single exemplar of a manifestation.

Which is all very well, but it's still pretty impenetrable. I'd like to 
see (in the first 10 results for googling FRBR) some examples, such as 
books, videos, music, a PDF of a confernce paper, a recording of a 
performance of a play, and so forth. I think it would cut through much 
of the confusion.

Given a set of examples for each level, it would be so much easier for 
people to map things into the model. Without it there's going to be 
heaps of junk data where people just guess.

Also, making some examples would expose any confusion and assumptions.

There are some attempts at examples on the DC-RDA wiki:

http://dublincore.org/dcmirdataskgroup/Scenarios

For each scenario, click on the link that looks like "Scenarios/1" and  
you'll see turtle and RDF/XML representations of the data using FRBR  
entities and RDA elements. These haven't gotten much discussion and  
I'm not sure I agree with all of it, but we can add more examples and  
more interpretations of them on that site if that would help.

Thanks, Karen. This pretty much rubs in that there is no "quick start" 
for this model, and the person creating records is expected to 
understand the details of the data model. This may work well with fully 
trained library staff, but in the author-deposits world I work in, 
that's impractical.

Part of the goal of open bibliographic data is that it should be 
reasonably easy for people to create and consume (and discover, but 
that's a separate discussion).

This model seems to describe the 'truth' better than some, but does it 
facilitate or hinder creation and consumption?

For me the question is not whether FRBR should be exposed to those creating bibliographic data (it shouldn't - even within libraries while I'd expect professional cataloguers to be able to engage with this, these are few and far between, and many staff in libraries working with bib data on a day to day basis are not professionally qualified), but whether it is useful way to model the data in our systems.

I find it interesting that the original aim behind FRBR was to "The intent was to produce a conceptual model that would serve as the basis for relating specific attributes and relationships (reflected in the record as discrete data elements) to the various tasks that users perform when consulting bibliographic records." (http://archive.ifla.org/VII/s13/frbr/frbr1.htm#1.2)

While this seems like a good idea - and I think has been extremely helpful in informing thoughts about resource discovery interfaces - I'm not sure it necessarily follows that this is the best data model for capture, storage or manipulation of bibliographic data outside discovery tasks. I'd argue that we need to find models that support a FRBR approach to resource discovery - so we need to think about how easy it is to present information back in a FRBRised display - which means looking at how we indicate equivalence and dealing with deduplication etc.

I'm feeling my way here, but the 'item' is the thing that most people relate to - so getting them to conceptualise anything other than this is not useful. However, when you capture the item related information you can look at how this groups with existing information. This would suggest (for example) that when you add an item title, your are prompted as to whether it matches an existing title - which may give us our manifestation 'title proper' etc.

We are already used to this I think as we might expect when adding an author to choose from a list of existing authors (if possible)

Enough - not sure if this is helpful or not!

I made a stab at this in the following wiki page, mainly for my own
understanding and that of others on Bibliographica here:

<http://wiki.okfn.org/p/Bibliographica/FRBR>

I've also tried to link to the most useful FRBR resources I'd found at
the bottom of that (I'm sure there's many I've missed!)

That's really useful Karen, I hadn't seen that before.

What I find immediately confusing in Scenario 1 is why Vonnegut's
novel is a Work but the translation is an Expression? For example,
both efforts would receive copyright as new "works",  though the
translation would obviously be considered a "derivative work".

While it is clear there is a derivative relation to be expressed it
seems to me the Work-Expression hierarchy is the wrong way to do this.

For example, what happens if someone were to translate the translation
(or make a play of film based on the translation)? You'd then couldn't
model this derived-from relationship via Work->Expression hierarchy
because the translation is not a work but an expression. As I said
before I rather feel FRBR has confused derived-from (which can occur
multiple times: X derives from Y derives from Z) with a hierarchy
(with a single level).

Or perhaps, I'm missing something here ...

Thanks for pointing this out. How does one submit feedback -- just

I think it makes more sense to pick some things that people will want to 
do with the data, and make a good spread of those possible. As far as I 
can see, the rationale for work/exp/man is the different ways people 
would want to query/reference/retrieve a thingy.

Roughly speaking;

    * Work = Do you have a copy of Shakespeare's Hamlet?
    * Expression = Do you have a copy of the unabridged Battlefield
      Earth? (hopefully not) -- references about paragraphs are to an
      expression.
    * Manifestation = Do you have a copy of the 1st edition of Alice in
      Wonderland --references about page numbers are to a manifestation

(Item is obvious for books, but probably represents also having a copy 
available for download.)

Most bibligraphic systems will keep data about work/exp/man against a 
single identifier. Sometimes this will be easy to unpack (ISBN belongs 
to the manifestation), sometimes not.

I think when looking at what to use for open bibliographic formats we 
should start with some educated guesses as to some things people might 
do with open bibliographic data; Off the top of my head...

    * use 3rd party tools to browse a library catalogue,
    * create a distributed ABE books,
    * build a reading list,
    * cite things in a semanticly enabled document format,
    * keep track of their personal book/dvd/cd collection,
    * an amazon wishlist style file for your foaf profile,
    * library research (as in studying libraries),
    * finding next-best versions of unavailable items (eg. finding the
      pre-print for a cited journal article).

On the subject of the FRBR model, I think discussions have reached?and
may have started at?a point of diminishing returns. What's needed is
*doing*, and doing in a community.

LibraryThing introduced a FRBR-like model more than three years ago,
and the community has spent the last three years working together
through all the edge cases and difficult problems, establishing
precedents and secondary rules. We've changed the model and the
features that it triggers. We haven't finished, but we're farther
along, and much farther than any one person or even group of people
could have come before we did it.

This sort of rules-plus-conversant-tradition is what undergirds many
rule-bound but human institutions (law and religion come to mind). One
shouldn't expect library science to operate differently.

No, the way Work is defined in FRBR it is the conceptualization, even  
if translated into different languages. Being turned from a book to a  
movie, however, creates a new work.

It actually makes sense. If I read Mann's Magic Mountain in English,  
and you read it in the original German, we could still have a  
conversation about what we liked and disliked about the book (Work).  
We read the same Work, but in different expressions.

And in response to Jim, the Work level is one that is very useful for  
user services. Most users come to the library asking for a Work, not a  
manifestation. They want to read Moby Dick or Alice in Wonderland or  
the latest book in the Twilight series, and it is the story they are  
interested in, and that is the Work.

In many ways I agree. The better way to do this may be to emphasize  
relationships (this is a translation of...) rather than try to create  
this 4-layer group of entities. One reason given for the different  
entities is that they are necessary in order to create relationships,  
like "this is a translation of that expression."

Last time I tried, the wiki was housed elsewhere and was so hard to  
edit that we had folks send their comments to a few of us, and we  
edited for them. Since then it has moved to a new home, but I haven't  
really tried to edit. I'll look into that.

Some discussion can take place on the dc-rda discussion list, which is  
the list for the project that produced those pages.  
http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/lists/dc-rda.html. It's a DC task group. It  
hasn't been terribly active lately, but it still might be the best  
place to talk about some of these things.

Hi Tim, it would be great to learn from your experiences and even better
to be
able to share data back-and-forth. Is there a way I can get machine readable
data about a particular work?

A first attempt with:

    curl -H "Accept: application/rdf+xml"
http://www.librarything.com/work/8151107

unfortunately fails.

Cheers,

See "APIs" link at bottom of page (
http://www.librarything.com/services/ ). We have other data we're
willing to share.

My point isn't particular experiences. LibraryThing's work system
isn't enough like FRBR to draw parallels. My point is to HAVE
experiences. Get people working with it. And if you can't get people
to work with it for free and for fun, it's probably a bad idea
anyway... :)

Sorry Karen, I have never in my life known anyone who wanted the "work" of Moby Dick or Alice in Wonderland. They may be interested in a choice of specific language versions (expressions) but while you may be interested in all English translations of the Bible, and need some specific books and verses, I haven't met anyone who also needs Bulgarian and Chinese and Korean and Cherokee. What they (and I) would do would be to browse through the cards (as I later discovered, the uniform titles for these famous works), and "ooh!" and "aahh!" as I saw War and Peace in German, French, Chinese, Japanese, ... But I didn't need any of them.

Again, in the card catalog, the "work" was just one way for the cards to be arranged so that they could be browsed. They had to be in there somehow, and that was one way. But taking this old arrangement and declaring it to be an "entity" with different "attributes" is a fallacy in my opinion. It's not--it's an arrangement of cards (manifestations). Taking the concepts of "work" and "expression" beyond arrangement distorts them into something they are not, resulting in all kinds of strange problems, as people are discovering now and as your work has demonstrated.

To continue, simply because catalogers arranged the cards in the drawers in certain ways does not mean that people ever "wanted" these arrangements. This "work" arrangement was probably most useful for the catalogers themselves, who needed an inventory of the collection.

This is why I continue to maintain that we need to build something for our users *today*. What I am thinking about are some really new ideas, e.g. Google's displays, e.g.  http://tinyurl.com/2uu77gs, which has all kinds of cool things, although several I don't know how useful they are. I think people may find the word cloud useful, but I'm not sure if the Google API includes it. I have a feeling that Facebook may come up with something if they haven't already (for better or worse).

I don't know how people search and what they want; I am learning about how I myself search, and it is almost totally different from what I did 25 years ago. I don't think anybody knows right now since it is changing constantly. But there is a lot of research being done on "information seeking behavior" and "scholarly communication".

Right, but it would be useful if you didn't have umpteen search results for
what are really the same thing (War and Peace) and instead the user had the
option to choose the language or edition from some sort of "Work" page.

I don't think it's unreasonable to imagine a scenario where the primary
language of the library's collection (let's say English) is understood by
the user (for sake of example, a foreign student) but if materials are
available in their native language or something they're perhaps more
familiar with (maybe they're Polish, but a little more fluent in German or
Russian than English), they can immediately see what's available, without
limiting their searches merely to those languages (which I would be
surprised if users generally did).  And while this is a bit of an edge case
(less so at large universities, probably, or public libraries with larger
immigrant populations), it's not solely limited to this particular
scenario.  Audiobooks, ebooks, film/television adaptations, etc. *all* would
be useful collated into some semblance of grouping around frbr (little "f")
notion of work.

I agree with Rufus, FRBR is at odds with the world in this sense.

Yes, that was agreed as the 'standard' but only after a great deal of debate and discussion. It seemed to me at the time that this was, at best, a compromise for the sake of agreement rather than a broad understanding that this was in some sense correct.

Does it?

In common parlance people would generally say they had read the same "book" which is one of the problems. If you need an unambiguous term then perhaps you could say you had read the same story. There are many aspects that will be common and certainly the translation is not as noteworthy as the original work, but the translation is a creative work in its own right (as any translator will tell you).

And yet, in many contexts the movie will provide an appealing, or even preferred, substitute for the book. Yet by recognising the movie as a work we no longer recognised the relationship with the novel on which it is based. Even more so should we consider the relationship between Rome and Juliet and West Side Story, or the relationship between Mama Mia and the Abba songs.

FRBR has abstracted away all the detail that would allow this rich tapestry to be described in a useful way.

This is the point I argued in 'bring frbr down to earth'.

The relationships are key and the WEMI hierarchy is too simplistic. By being too simplistic it becomes very hard to fit the rich tapestry of the real-world into it - it's only 3 parts away from saying everything is just a thing.

The translation example above is a good one. Translations may be of many things, even in the case of rare manuscripts of a specific physical object. The relationships are key - and a heap of real-world classes would help too.

So what you're saying is that what users want is the Expression, and I 
can agree with that. They don't know that's what they want, and in a 
public library in the US when you walk up to the desk (or go to the 
catalog) you probably don't need to specify the language in most cases 
because the libraries mainly carry English-language items. But rarely do 
users want a particular manifestation. (Maybe the ISTC -- the standard 
for text identifiers -- will be helpful here.)

I find the Work views in Open Library to be quite useful (although they 
need more facets on that page). [1]  We can link them up to discussions 
of the author and his/her works in Wikipedia, or to lit crit articles or 
reviews. If nothing else, the Work view means that users do not see the 
same thing over and over in the catalog display. If the Work view allows 
you to click on a language facet, then I think you've given the user the 
"least clicks" access to what they are looking for. And this is what I 
mean about turning this into useful functionality. Take the user to a 
page for Moby Dick (all versions, all languages). Have facets for 
language, format (audio book, large print book). Have links to the story 
as a movie, a comic book. But bring it all together in one page, don't 
make the user scroll through a long list. THAT is the value of isolating 
this thing that might be called a FRBR Work.

> Again, in the card catalog, the "work" was just one way for the cards to be arranged so that they could be browsed. They had to be in there somehow, and that was one way. But taking this old arrangement and declaring it to be an "entity" with different "attributes" is a fallacy in my opinion. It's not--it's an arrangement of cards (manifestations). Taking the concepts of "work" and "expression" beyond arrangement distorts them into something they are not, resulting in all kinds of strange problems, as people are discovering now and as your work has demonstrated.

No, it hasn't. Because FRBR is not just WEMI. Half or more of the FRBR 
document is about bibliographic relationships, but we seem to keep 
forgetting that. You CAN create a relationship between the text and the 
movie (I believe it is "adapted" in this case) and you could FAVOR those 
relationships in your display. I think we keep getting tripped up in 
WEMI and forget that there is a very rich set of relationships both in 
FRBR and RDA. See my "Table of Relationships by Entity":
   http://kcoyle.net/rda/group1relsby.html

What is keeping us from creating a really impressive web of 
relationships is that we can't agree on what the relationships link - 
that is, WEMI. WEMI is the weak link, but we need THINGS to relate to 
other THINGS. And, as Ross and I have simultaneously pointed out, 
presenting users with long lists of publications that contain virtually 
the same content is not a good way to have them visualize the 
bibliographic world. So we need a high level view (call it story, call 
it work, I really don't care) before we get down to the actual 
retrievable items. In fact, I think that there is value in this high 
level view apart from getting users to the content -- that we could have 
a very interesting discussion about relationships abstracted from 
retrieving the content itself.

Maybe a translation is actually derived from a particular
expression/manifestation since
human translators have no access to the work qua work and probably had a
physical
copy or item that they were working from, though which this is they may
rarely tell us
(nor whether a coffee stain obliterated most of the text on the bottom
of page 53 which
is why their fidelity wavers there).

I would agree that a translation is a work in its own right, as might be
a particularly
inspired musical performance particularly with musical styles that place
an emphasis
on improvisation -- listening to two jazz musicians playing the same
tune in two different
settings you might be hard pressed to assert that they were making
manifest their
expressions of the same work rather than expressing two different works
derived from
a common source.

I guess the reason we were initially considering a FRBR-like
representation was that
it would be helpful as a standard to facilitate interoperability of
data. But I am beginning
to gather that it is not a widely implemented standard despite having
been around for
more than a decade and doesn't seem to map well onto most people's
notions of the real
world...

Hmmm...

Such relationships should be described by some kind of extension, if at 
all. Describing relationships like this semantically is difficult and of 
limited value for the effort and complexity required.

If I want to read a copy of the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, then 
any copy in a language I speak is fine. An audio book could/should be 
considered as just-another-manifestation, but a film or audio drama is 
just a related work. Relationships between different works is an entire 
rabbit hole of its own which is not essential to providing a useful 
model. It can be added to a working model later, probably with different 
datasets requiring different ways of modelling such things.

I strongly disagree about the "limited value" part. If one is concerned
about running a
library that might be true. If one is concerned with mapping
researchers' knowledge
about works and writers in their fields then it goes right to the core
of the project.

It is still hard though

This goes back to my original question. Rephrased, is FRBR a suitable
working model
for people to hang their more elaborate statements off of? Or is it
confusing enough that
people won't be able to consistently identify which subjects and objects
they mean?

My feeling at this point is to go with a much flattened
Work-Manifestation model and
freely create new Works where needed (e.g. translations) with a
predicate like
derivedFrom or a sub-predicate like translationOf as needed.

Cheers,

So what you're saying is that what users want is the Expression, and I 
can agree with that. They don't know that's what they want, and in a 
public library in the US when you walk up to the desk (or go to the 
catalog) you probably don't need to specify the language in most cases 
because the libraries mainly carry English-language items. But rarely do 
users want a particular manifestation. (Maybe the ISTC -- the standard 
for text identifiers -- will be helpful here.)

I find the Work views in Open Library to be quite useful (although they 
need more facets on that page). [1]  We can link them up to discussions 
of the author and his/her works in Wikipedia, or to lit crit articles or 
reviews. If nothing else, the Work view means that users do not see the 
same thing over and over in the catalog display. If the Work view allows 
you to click on a language facet, then I think you've given the user the 
"least clicks" access to what they are looking for. And this is what I 
mean about turning this into useful functionality. Take the user to a 
page for Moby Dick (all versions, all languages). Have facets for 
language, format (audio book, large print book). Have links to the story 
as a movie, a comic book. But bring it all together in one page, don't 
make the user scroll through a long list. THAT is the value of isolating 
this thing that might be called a FRBR Work.
</snip>

I don't know if people want expressions or not. From my reference work with various types of people, I have discovered that it takes a long time to know what people want. All I know is that from my work with undergraduates (quite a bit now), they expect something very, very different from the library tools I have seen.

I am not finding fault with anyone. I am simply interested in creating a *practical" tool that will be of *real use* to our patrons and this means that everything we do must be questioned--nothing should be sacred. I love catalogs and have spent my career building them, but with the implementation of RDA plus the economic crisis, this has become a deeply serious topic.

The Open Library page is a better display than the very well-done, but bizarre Fiction Finder, which does a very good job of FRBR, but is horrifying to behold. http://fictionfinder.oclc.org I can't make any links directly into it, but just at random I am looking at Joyce's "A portrait of the artist as a young man" and I can't imagine that these displays would be of any real help to anyone. Certainly, they wouldn't help my students and I'm sure they would make a mental note never to return to the site again!

On the Open Library page for Moby Dick that you gave, do people really have such a need for this summary? And in fact, what is the purpose of the separate page? What if the "works" or "expressions" were only queries that bring the relevant records together for the user to manipulate further? For the headings there, Lucene and Zebra indexing can now extract the headings in a much more useful way, e.g. see the Koha catalog at Antioch http://tinyurl.com/2ukcwny and how Zebra indexing extracts the headings into the left-hand column.

I think Rob Stiles summed it up very well:
"FRBR has abstracted away all the detail that would allow this rich tapestry to be described in a useful way."

For example, if I were a student interested in Moby Dick, what would I want to know? I might want to know of videos that discuss Moby Dick and classes that discuss it:
http://www.c-spanvideo.org/videoLibrary/search-results.php?keywords=moby%20dick

That is exactly what the OL page does. The page is derived from the data 
in the database. Whether or not it shows summaries or first lines is 
really up to the implementation, but it is essentially what you say: a 
query that brings the relevant records together. At that point, users 
can move in various directions. If you click on the subject
    http://openlibrary.org/subjects/ship_captains_in_fiction
from that page you go to a subject page that has a publishing timeline, 
and a lot of choices for next steps for the user. I think this should be 
the point of the library catalog (or any catalog for that matter), which 
is to help people discover things they might not have originally thought 
about.

This also illustrates something that I talk about a lot: pulling 
together data from the records and making it visual. How long would it 
take a user who gets a list of hundreds of bib records to derive 
something like that timeline? Or to make the links from Moby Dick to all 
of the possible relevant subjects? This is what our systems should be 
doing for users, mining retrieved sets for information.

Because the data is there, that type of display could be added to OL -- 
it's all a matter of choices, and OL will undoubtedly change over time. 
The main thing is to have the data elements in a usable form, and to 
experiment with different displays and different information 
visualizations.

I don't know enough about FRBR to comment on its strengths and
weaknesses in detail, but I'm concerned that people seem to be
confusing a data model with the user visible manifestation (not
Manifestation) of that model.  There's no law that says you have to
have one data entry/display screen per entity.  Hopefully none of your
current system make visible how many database tables were used in
their construction.  A software engineer is free to put together a
"book" page that's got a little Manifestation data with a sprinkling
of Expression info and a taste of user specific data if that's what's
useful for people.

There's a lot of power and value in having a rich data model, but that
needs to be tempered by the need to manage complexity to the bounds
which are understandable and implementable by mere mortals.  It's
disappointing though to see people arbitrarily saying things "aren't
important" because they have little value in their world view.  One
reader may want a story in any language they read, but a different
scholar may be interested in comparing different translations of a
work in the same language or across languages.  The model needs to be
able to store the information to make both possible.  The simple stuff
should be easy, but the more complex should still be possible.

User models have limited transferability to computers because users
are so much better at dealing with ambiguity.  I can borrow a book
from my library (meaning the library system as represented by the
bookmobile that visits), go to a reading at the library (meaning the
local neighborhood branch library), or go to a concert at the library
(meaning the old library building which now serves as community center
and which has a different official name, but everyone still calls the
"Hunt Library") and anyone with the same shared context can easily
disambiguate all the different "libraries."  Computers aren't that
smart and these three different kinds of things all need to be modeled
differently.

I'd echo Tim's sentiment that any practical modeling effort needs to
be informed by real world experience.  You'll still need to separate
out whether people are complaining about lousy UIs vs unusable data
models, but there's no substitute for real world data and live users.
I had a quick look at the LibraryThing site and didn't see anything
about their data model and the license looked pretty scary ("We have
yet to settle on a license. You agree to abide by whatever license we
eventually choose." - Yikes!!) so I didn't want to poke too far, but
if they were willing to share, it would be a good data point.

The Freebase publishing domain (http://www.freebase.com/view/book)
only has 3 million books, but it's got a relatively rich data model
[1] which supports works, adaptations[3,4], and translations[5,6,7].
Another strength is that it isn't limited to the publishing domain, so
one can go from a book to the play to the performance of the play to
the movie that was made from the play to the soundtrack album for the
movie or from your naval architecture book to the ships the author, a
naval architect, designed, etc, etc.  I'd encourage folks to think
about how book related things are connected to the rest of the world.
Books are cool, but they're just a tiny slice of the world.  I think
collaborative schema development is another Freebase strength.  Anyone
can extend the schema, propose the extensions for promotion to the
commons, or discuss the existing schema and it's all done in situ with
live data for people to work with.  This allows incremental
improvement of the schema over time (refactoring the data as you go).

The schema for translations currently allows translations to either be
simply entered as another edition of a book, in relatively
undifferentiated, but simple, fashion or, with some extra effort, to
enter them as a separate work, linked to the original, with
translator's name, etc.  Freebase commits the error of having the UI
tied tightly to the schema that I said to avoid and because of this I
think the translation schema is at (or beyond) the limit of complexity
that a user can deal with.  Being able to experiment with actually
entering data provides much more insight into this than studying a
specification would.

Sorry this is so long, but one final question in conclusion.  What's
the point of this discussion?  I suspect the FRBR committee is off in
standards committee mode and will do whatever "professional library
scientists" deem is appropriate.  Is the goal to try to get them to
change or to propose/implement an alternative or just kvetch about the
general state of bibliographic schemas?

Instead of starting yet another "one, true, open bibliographic
database," was there any consideration given to attempting coordinate
and improve communication among the existing efforts like BibKN, Open
Library, and the raft of others out there?  It seems like that would
be a lot more useful and productive than ratcheting up the level of
competition and duplication yet another notch.  It certainly seems
true that the existing efforts aren't particularly collaborative in
their approaches, but I don't see how adding yet another stovepipe to
the mix is going to improve things.

"Open" is about more than just putting the word in your project title
-- whether it be Open Library or Open Knowledge Foundation.

Yes. There are ongoing discussion between William and Rufus and myself about cooperation
between Bibliographica and BibKN. I'd be glad to see OL engaged as well. I've been in contact
with OL people, but to date the cost of OL/BibKN cooperation has exceeded the apparent benefits.
There is at present a disconnect between OL data and academic researcher article data which is
the primary interest of BibKN. I'd love to be able to extract out of OL the subset of book titles and
authors of interest to academic researchers e.g. in mathematics or statistics or economics or some
other discipline, but I dont have the resources to do this and maintain the results. Anyone able to help 
with that?

I welcome suggestions from this group about how to to improve cooperation, and how to get
further resources directed towards the common goals of  these projects.

Subject: [open-bibliography] FRBR, relationships and inference
Message-ID: <4BFF0ABE0200001400035CE1@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

Puh,

I just tried to read through the tons of very interesting mails you guys wrote over the last week and would now like to add to it by giving my two cents about the FRBR model and the question of which approach to take to get rich data which is easy to produce and is a fruitful basis for research. I will step back a bit first to make my point in the end.

As it seems, nobody disagrees with producing Open Bibliographic Data as Linked Data, i.e. data complying with the RDF model. Which is good, because RDF models very elegant the basic operation we do when we make a statement about something: reference and predication. We identify something and say something about it. This is the stuff librarians and other data producers have done for centuries: identifying a resource and saying something about it. And RDF uses unambigous public names (URIs) for entities and predicates which accounts for its virtue over past approaches.

I have to make clear: I'd like to have URIs for works and we need URIs for works because they are important for literary scholars and the like. But I think we'll never agree on _one_ model for defining works. Because there is no obvious way to distinguish a work entitiy. We'd have to prescribe the way of identifying works which won't work. We need another approach.

So let's just identify which we can easily agree on as one entity, let's take care of (id)entities we can easily distinguish. These entities are items and manifestations, the entities we catalogued/described all along: 
Individual books (items) are easily distinguished from each other  and as such identified easily as long as we are in the print domain. And manifestations are quite easily identified as well, because they can be defined as a set of texts which share the sameness of spelling. 
Note: In the digital domain we can't catalog items because they only exist transiently on screens, it only makes sense to describe manifestations. (And I would argue that a digitalization of a book and the corresponding print-manifestation are instantiations of the same manifestation. I don't understand why we make to records for these - at least in Germany. Following this approach, media-type would be an attribute for items... )

So we got items and manifestations and items are linked to manifestations and inherit some of their properties (as it is the case in actual catalogs). What's nect to do is: Propose and use relations between Items, Manifestations and the entitites in FRBR groups 2 and 3 (which make sense in my opinion and I think so far nobody objected to them).

I think what is really important here are relations between manifestations like: consequentEdition and previousEdition, revisedEdition, abridgedEdition, illustratedEdition, translation, filmAdaptation, radioPlayAdaptation, parody, plagiarism, commentary, hommage and so on. If we got this data, for example we could infer the original edition and the language of the original work, we wouldn't have to add it to a work description ourselves.  And the best: Other people could infer work entities by grouping stuff together as they find useful. If somebody wants the movie to be part of the work: OK. If others want a translation to be a new work: Why not? It's the Semantic Web, isn't it designed to do this stuff?

This approach doesn't exclude grouping works from the start as long as I record the relevant attributes and relationships from which other people could infer other work groupings.

I hope I didn't just repeat what was already said. What do you think about it?

dear Tom, all,

I enjoyed your previous email: "I'd encourage folks to think about how 
book related things are connected to the rest of the world. Books are 
cool, but they're just a tiny slice of the world..." but ultimately "Is 
the goal to try to get them to change or to propose/implement an 
alternative or just kvetch about the general state of bibliographic 
schemas?"

I see a lot of this in the geodata world where i belong (I Am Not A 
Library Scientist) - getting absorbed in complexity of our domain 
models, fiddling around with the imagined 90%/10% split of use cases, 
ultimately cutting ourselves off from a broader information ecosystem 
with domain specific standards, when the information that we've got has 
such potential to unite other domains.

However i meant to make a response to your words below:

In this case, open (source, standards, data).

One has to come to the table with a stake; how else to kick along a 
collaborative approach? Making the software open source from the outset, 
designed to network among instances.

Having an I Told You So Moment - sorry Jonny - technical discussions of 
models and formats can too quickly get bogged down. Perhaps better to 
focus on interfaces, interchangeability.

As Karen pointed out some time back, there are interesting and useful 
relations-between-media-objects defined in parts of the FRBR spec. These 
can be lifted out, reused in a Linked Data vocabulary without commitment 
to the vague-yet-specific core model of FRBR.

There is always and necessarily going to be a lot of duplication of 
records - so make APIs to de-duplicate combined streams of metadata 
records - and use RDF and the other standards to easily migrate data 
between places where it is stored and searched.

The alternative looks like one ring to rule them all, right, scary 
things like http://viaf.org/ , and power to the publishers...

best,

This is good since this display is generated and demands no real extra work to create from scratch. Of course, the formal FRBR work attributes will necessarily get thrown out. I still question the utility of the summary for Moby Dick. If you take that out, and the Lucene/Zebra indexing is applied to extract the headings, what are we left with? A traditional list of catalog records. It's nice; it's certainly an improvement over the traditional displays; but does this sort of display fit people's needs today?

The only way to find out would be to conduct research on different populations, but I would hazard the guess that mostly, it does not. For example, I can't imagine how my students would find this type of display to be of any practical help to them. Yet, when I ask myself what really would be of use, I find it far more difficult to find an answer.

I think I am too much into the traditional methods to figure this out and I would have to defer to outsiders. Nevertheless, the FRBR user tasks seem to me more irrelevant than ever.

That's a start :-). Take a look at:
    http://kcoyle.net/rda/group1relsby.html
for a fairly complete list of relationships beyond adaptation and  
translation. So, if I wanted to make use of some of these, is there a  
way to add them to Freebase? I would really like to start modeling  
some of the more complex relationships that are inherent in library  
data but haven't been made explicit in our catalogs.

Oh, and since the ones in that list are tied to FRBR entities, I will  
make a list that doesn't have that connection and will post it at:
   http://kcoyle.net/rda

... but you can find them defined in the metadata registry at:

http://metadataregistry.org/schema/show/id/13.html

And you can grab the definitions in RDF there as well.

Extracted from the above url:

A service like VIAF could be created by aggregation; each library coins
its own URI namespace to hold its own authority records. Implicitly,
because the record is within the library's domain name, the
authorityAgency is the holder of the domain name. Bring the records
together by aggregation, and then run the OCLC name-similarity and
linking algorithms over the whole collection, while providing anyone
else with the means to do the same. 

This is the purpose of the BKN project  http://people.bibkn.org/
currently with other sources of name authority data besides what libraries could provide.
A simple record format BibJSON http://www.bibkn.org/bibjson/index.html
allows any agent to express what they know about a name and its connections.
Datasets in this format can then be loaded to the aggregator which converts to RDF.
We have yet to implement name-similarity algorithms over the whole collection, but
we are doing this over subsets of the data.
We are in the process of moving this project to an OKFN server, and looking for contributors of data, 
code and expertise to this effort.
Pointers to open source name-similarity and linking algorithms would be appreciated.

OL is developing the ability to create "lists" -- AKA bibliographies  
-- that could be exported, so it may be possible for you to have a  
running list that you could export and update. Unfortunately, there  
isn't a set date for this feature, but I know it is highly desired.

It seems to me that one goal could be inter-linking between them. OL  
is negotiating links to other book sites, like GoodReads and perhaps  
LibraryThing. (I've also been encouraging them to consider linking to  
VIAF for named persons, something that BibKN might consider.) It makes  
sense to do this because each site will have some different  
information about the resource, in particular different user  
participation. It would be good to make it easy for users and programs  
to navigate through these different sites for a given book, article,  
author, subject, or whatever.

There are areas of duplication, but I don't see that as a bad thing.  
The basic bib info may be duplicative, but it is needed to support the  
functionality of the site, so I don't see how that can be avoided. We  
do need to share identifiers so that we can know when two resources in  
different databases represent the same work. Is DBpedia the best place  
to do that? It would be fairly simple to link OL ids to DBpedia where  
an ISBN is present. It's harder to calculate equivalence without it,  
but it can be done. I also think that we should gather/store all of  
the identifiers that we can for each resource -- from Library of  
Congress Cataloging numbers to DOIs to Amazon ASINs... It will make  
linking easier.

Freebase has a bunch of these (libretto, series, subseries, sequel,
screenplay, contained in, etc) and others I think are over modeled
(e.g. eight flavors of adaptation instead of a single property which
connects different types of entities).

> So, if I wanted to make use of some of these, is there a way to

Sure.  You can either do it as a modeling experiment with the existing
Freebase data or add your own data too.  Basically you just define new
types that include your desired properties and add them to the topics.
 You can either extend/subclass existing types or do something
entirely independent.  If you want feedback, there's a community of
people with experience modeling stuff or you can bring in your own
domain experts and form a little sub-community to help you (or do it
all on your own).

If the help on the site isn't enough to get you going, shoot me an
email and I'd be happy to help get you started.

I actually see the uncoordinated duplication of data as part of the
problem.  The Open Library data is pretty low quality right now, but
hopefully it will be improving (hint to OL: people would help you with
this if you let them).  How will BibKN get the updates with those
improvements?  If BibKN goes ahead and cleans up their little
extracted subset, how do those changes get back to OL? How are the two
sets of changes reconciled if they conflict?

I think acknowledging that there will be multiple repositories of
bibliographic data with different focuses and figuring out how they
exchange updates cooperatively would be a useful thing.  Having strong
provenance for the data and modifications to it is a key enabler, I
think.

The main thing is to get the dialog established.  It sounds like there
have been some bilateral discussions.  Perhaps it's time to widen the
scope.

I don't see a license either on the VIAF web site or in the data
stream, so it's a little hard to judge how scary this is.

Anyone know what the licensing is?

BTW, one of the nice things about the web is that it's pretty hard to
establish and maintain "choke points" of control.  VIAF will be just
one of many federated sources of bibliographic data, which is good
because even national libraries aren't either omniscient or infallible
(cf LCSH "Lincoln, Abraham, 1806-1865--Assassination--Pictorial
works." when he was born 1809).  In this future, data is judged on its
quality, not its source.

They've been this way from the start, when they told participants in
the first meeting we could blog about it. They were afraid, I think,
of Google. Whatever.

It's got nothing but worse since then. Having defended them for years,
and supported them whenever I could--certainly in my attacks on OCLC,
and not incidentally with data--I've almost given up on them.

I see it as part of the solution, provided we empower agents who actually know something
about the data to help clean the parts they care about, and keep their own copies of the clean
data exposed back to a larger pool for all to see.
There can be many overlapping sets of more or less well-curated biblio collections.  
Curators can acquire reputations for quality.  


> The Open Library data is pretty low quality right now, but hopefully it will be improving 
> (hint to OL: people would help you with this if you let them).  

Let me strongly reinforce that. If I and others had easy access to selected subsets of a 
few thousand titles of OL data in fields they cared about,  we could machine match those 
titles against various other sources, and publish the results back to the web of linked data. 

> How will BibKN get the updates with those improvements?  

I think its up to BibKN nodes to query OL from time to time with ids to see if 
there is any change. If OL can provide node-specific feeds, thats very convenient. BibKN
nodes can then do what they want with such feeds.

> If BibKN goes ahead and cleans up their little extracted subset, how do those changes get 
> back to OL? 

That is entirely up to OL. OL can facilitate matters for users by linking from their records 
to a BibKN node they trust for further info. Users can chase that link if they care to.

> How are the two sets of changes reconciled if they conflict?

I see no need for global reconciliation, and the cost of facilitating that seems
far too great. 
OL admins and users can make whatever corrections they deem necessary from their perspective. 
BibKN node admins and users can do the same.

> I think acknowledging that there will be multiple repositories of

I strongly agree.

Again, strong agreement.

Fine with me. I welcome further contributions to the discussion.

I've been on holiday for the past week (read: offline) but I must jump
into this potentially finished FRBR discussion ;)

I've been troubled by the layering in the model. 'Work' as an almost
platonic ideal, the distinct artistic creation, almost fits and 'Item'
as a physical embodiment is pretty understandable. 

Where I hit the brick wall is with Manifestation and Expression - for
me, the relationships and context around 'creations' are numerous and
interdependent: Translations, editions, etc are very loose terms for
sometimes complex activities - at what point does a translation cross
those boundaries? Take Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowolf for
example.

Doesn't this come down to an individual's interpretation of what
constitutes an artistic creation? If so, haven't we learnt that to build
in any form of centralised control over the decision of what is art (ie
a new Work) and what isn't (a new Expression) is a bit of a folly?

I think there is a mismatch between what exists and the FRBR
compartmentalisation. What we really have are items with
multidimensional* relationships to other items that only make sense in
context. Forgive my RDF-biased metaphor but I see items as being any
node in a graph and that graph containing much of the information on the
people, publishers, sources of data, book holdings, and so on. Note that
not all this information could exist in a computer system - it is
important to remember the info in a cataloguer's head or the head of the
user performing a search as this heavily affects their understanding and
interpretation of the computer's data.

* variability in terms of translation, version, edition, age, source,
publisher, editor and many more predicates

In summary, I think that FRBR is trying to make (potentially) graphable
data fit a small, short hierarchy without many verbs (as danbri
reportedly said via Karen).

I would suggest that there is a lot of mileage in allowing people to
share what their perception of what levels like these could be used for
in a live system. We may find the need for several types of Work or none
at all. I would gamble on Expression and Manifestation rapidly
collapsing together for the benefit of all ;)

I agree, and this is why I would like to start experimenting with a  
wildly relationship based set of data. I need to do that to see what  
the result would be if we have:

A expresses B
C expresses B
D expresses A
D expresses B

I need to see it with actual bib data, because my imagination is  
insufficient to do it abstractly. The question becomes: what can we  
infer from the relationships? How messy can they get before things  
fall apart? Are there relationships that are more *right* than others?

How I've dealt with this in the past is to take the notion of a
datum/triple's source very very seriously.

Eg I have a registry of Item information (tech: in a pairtree, rdf +
named graphs in each 'object', nothing as complex as a dflat) - most of
the items have a definite source, which is indicated in the rdf
metadata.

I have additional registries containing information such as "sameas"
information (sameas in big quotes - think fluffy sameas assertions,
rather than truths) where I can add in Work level objects to rope
together items, or collections, or saying that one object is actually
the same as another* 

* coreference model taken from literature published by the Southhampton
team eg http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/15245/

None of these registries make it as far as an enduser. These are used to
qualify and curate the sourced data, data that could've started life as
a row on a random spreadsheet, rather than from a URI.

The BRII project (http://brii.ouls.ox.ac.uk) works on these principles,
and because one or two loud academics objected to anyone being able to
see an aggregation of openly available data, I can't show you the
website. It's locked down to Oxford Uni only. Best I can do is show some
screenshots:

http://docs.google.com/present/view?id=0ARYGhMKCZeioZGRqNGM2ZzNfMTY3ZGtoa3RjZ24&hl=en

Note the sources and sync dates are always shown (much of the data comes
from monthly sourced reports, spreadsheets, scraped websites)

So, to get back to the point, I've found it very helpful to have a
simple RDF registry of the individual nodes we think we have (source
data), and then to overlay other registries over the top and pull out
information to index. 

Editors work on the down-and-dirty overlay registry to curate the source
data, or add/overide source data as needed. This makes the index data
invalid and so keeping these derived indexes tight to the new data is
important, not just for accuracy but for psychologically obvious
reasons :)

One typical curation task is to take metadata values such as "John
Smith" and to mint arbitrary URIs for this per 'record', as part of
modelling the source data in RDF. In other words, "John Smith" in one
item won't lead to the same URI as "John Smith" in another.

Then you apply whatever heuristics you wish to say that URIs are the
same as each other. For instance, if you know that from the source of
the data and the date range it covers, this John Smith can only be one
person, then you can easily make a bundle of triples stating 'sameas'
relationships between these new URIs, as well as a little RDF that
describes this bundle: creation date, heuristic(s) used, creator, etc.

Thirdly, you try to link this bundle URI to VIAF, IMDB, or whatever URIs
already exist for your person, recording the sameas in the same manner -
separate from the source data.

And finally, you have an automated service waiting for changes to the
underlying stack of data, waiting to update indexes which the outside
world most readily uses.

(Tip: I use mail encoding to put labels and URIs into lucene style
search engines. "John Smith <http://foo......>" for example. I haven't
yet written a tokeniser that pays attention to this encoding however,
and this is mainly because normal treatment works fine. If you have
'meaningless' URIs, this can give you finer control over what a search
may hit without needing to change the tokeniser as well. For example,
http://r.ox/b:2234fea0a89d versus http://r.ox/name/joan_smith_1980_1

Note that even though this has a parallel with the OAIS Ingest, Archive
and Dissemenate, it is quite distinct in practice. This way is more like
MVC taken to an extreme than OAIS, with particular emphasis on view and
model.

I agree that "item" is readily understandable (even with these crazy mashed-up web sites!) but "work" is not a thing but just one way to arrange those items. "Expression" is a sub-arrangement of "work," and "manifestation" is actually the public display of the "items". This is the traditional method of the catalog. Still, it does not follow that this traditional arrangement also describes how information itself is structured, and therefore we, and everyone, must rework what we are all doing.

I think that one of the main problems with FRBR is that different communities view it in different ways. Scenario 1) sees FRBR as a model of traditional information structure, as organized and described in library catalogs. Scenario 2) takes FRBR as a broader model in more universal and philosophical terms, how information in structured and used no matter what kind of information it is, and where it resides. 

Therefore, traditional library catalogers, once they begin to deal with some differences of terminology, will readily understand the FRBR datamodel because with perhaps a few exceptions, it is what they have always done.

But the other question remains: does FRBR offer a model in the universal context of scenario 2? I have never seen this demonstrated anywhere, although I have seen it expressed both openly and accepted tacitly. This basic tension between FRBR as a description of the traditional way library catalogs have been arranged and how they work vs. the broad philosophical statement that this same traditional model also describes the essence of how "information is structured" demands far more proof than I have seen. Add to this the fact that it conflicts with practical reality, and it all becomes especially important as libraries attempt to share their work more widely with other communities.

It seems as if it would be much more useful and profitable both to the library community and to those we wish to share with, if we were to concentrate on scenario 1: to make sure that others understand our traditional datamodel, what they will find there and how they can best extract it, so that when we share our information, others can take it in the best ways for their needs. But this repurposing of our work to fit into this increasingly dubious FRBR model actually seems counterproductive. 

For example, for a cataloger, creating a uniform title for a book he or she is cataloging is relatively easy now, but to turn this into a separate "entity" for the work and/or the expression is a completely different matter demanding more labor, while the usefulness to our patrons remains completely unclear, and it certainly doesn't make our catalogs any more "shareable" than right now.
