Message-ID: <54ca21751002240905u7221126rc5b51ffcd3ca8534@mail.gmail.com>

Welcome to the new list for the Working Group on Open Bibliographic
Data! A list of current members and the group's purpose is at:

  http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography

In terms of next steps, the first instance I propose:

  1. We make sure that we have broad representation from existing
projects and initiatives interested in open bibliographic data. It
would be great if everyone could cast their eyes over the list to see
if there are any obvious omissions!
  2. We find a regular slot to have monthly virtual meetings. I
suggest we do this on a weekday in the late afternoon/early evening
GMT, e.g. 1700 GMT / 1800 CET / 0900 PST.
  3. Once we have done 1. and 2., we aim to launch the working group
in the next few weeks?

How does this sound?

All the best,

As a PST'r (and thus in possibly the earliest time zone) I could do  
earlier, say two hours earlier. I know Jim P is in my zone, as it were  
-- how does earlier work for you? that could make it easier on the  
European members. Others on this coast?

Sounds good. Can I ask if anyone on the list (other than Ed Summers) is 
at Dev8D in London. It is possible that some other people on this list 
are currently in the same building as me!

Good for me.  What kind of virtual meeting did you have in mind?
How many participants can you handle with various media?

Subject: No subject
Message-ID: <mailman.3.1267118243.21076.open-bibliography@lists.okfn.org>

How are you planning to control the size and membership of this group?

Do you plan to restrict membership to those with a real commitment
to increasing the quality and quantity of open biblio data?

If so, how are you going to make this determination?

What exactly qualifies as "open biblio data"? (Public domain? CC0, CC BY? with or without NC or SA clauses, ...?

However you respond to the above, here is a list of potential participants 
I would encourage you to invite, all of them associated with the BKN Project:

Thomas Krichel, 
creator of RePEc http://repec.org/
and AuthorClaim Service http://authorclaim.org/
krichel at openlib.org

Fred Giasson creator/maintainer of BIBO http://bibliontology.com/
and developer of BKN people http://people.bibkn.org/
fred at fgiasson.com

Fil Menczer creator/maintainer of Scholarometer http://scholarometer.indiana.edu/
filmenczer at gmail.com

Micah Altman 
Micah_Altman at harvard.edu
Contact for Dataverse , Harvard Scholar's Sites, Harvard/MIT data archive

Lee Giles
giles at ist.psu.edu
Developer of CiteSeer

I could also suggest various industrial contacts (Google, Msoft, Freebase, Couchio, BePress, ... ) but I am not sure how the group feels about having industrial contacts on the list. My own view is that engaging industrial support is essential for success of open biblio data efforts. How this could or should be done 
is very much open to discussion.  Serious consideration of the licensing issues seems essential to resolve this.

There are also many more people loosely associated with the BKN project, but 
affiliated with publishers or sholarly socs which have mixed, apprehensive or 
hostile feelings about open biblio data for various reasons. Which
brings back the issue of criteria for membership of the group, and to what 
extent and how you want to control its size.

with best wishes to all

Having tried different options in the past, I would suggest IRC as
main point of contact. From this can use, e.g. Skype, Etherpad and
suchlike to the extent to which these are useful/appropriate.

> How many participants can you handle with various media?

If we use IRC my guess is that size won't be such an issue. If
necessary we can always break out into different focus groups.

The way I see it we should be open to new members and in the first
instance should keep administrative overhead (in terms of process,
membership, etc.) to a minimum.

> Do you plan to restrict membership to those with a real commitment
> to increasing the quality and quantity of open biblio data?

I think either commitment to actively promoting open bibliographic
metadata, or working on projects publishing or using such data.

> If so, how are you going to make this determination?

My feeling is to say that there is an expectation to contribute to the
Working Group and to participate in meetings, etc., but no formal
requirements?

> What exactly qualifies as "open biblio data"? (Public domain? CC0, CC BY? with or without NC or SA clauses, ...?

At a minimum, compliance with the Open Knowledge Definition:

  http://www.opendefinition.org/
  http://www.opendefinition.org/okd
  http://www.opendefinition.org/licenses/

> However you respond to the above, here is a list of potential participants

Excellent - many thanks for the suggestions! I wonder, if you know
them already - would you be willing to invite them on behalf of the
working group?

> I could also suggest various industrial contacts (Google, Msoft, Freebase, Couchio, BePress, ... ) but I am not sure how the group feels about having industrial contacts on the list. My own view is that engaging industrial support is essential for success of open biblio data efforts. How this could or should be done

I'm happy with inviting anyone with an commitment to open
bibliographic data. Personally those who *publish*, work with and
share back such data are a priority. Not so interested in those who
use data, but aren't interested in either promoting open data or
sharing back.

Would be interested to hear what you and other WG members think about above!

Sound good to me, too. +1 for the concern regarding conference calls.

> What exactly qualifies as "open biblio data"? (Public domain? CC0, CC BY? with or without NC or SA clauses, ...?

As far as I know, the "Public domain" is no legal term here in Germany
(but we have a close match called "Gemeinfreiheit"). Maybe the Open
Knowledge Definition (http://www.opendefinition.org/okd/) should be
the guideline to classify bibliographic data (resp. it's license) as
open? NC would be out of the game then...

Cheers,

Felix

The other day someone registered two very interesting packages on CKAN:

<http://ckan.net/package/ugent_biblio> - tab delimited file of all
Ghent University publications
<http://ckan.net/package/ugent_catalog> - dump of complete Ghent
University library catalog

The second of these is particularly interesting as open bibliographic
metadata is hard to come by!

On the CKAN pages the packages have been listed as public domain.
However, following the provided project url:
<http://lib.ugent.be/info/en/exports.shtml> one finds a nice "Open
Knowledge" button but also, unfortunately, the statement that: "This
work is licensed under a Creative Commons
Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 2.0 Belgium License."

Non-commercial licenses are obviously not http://opendefinition.org/
compliant (and a CC license isn't a good idea for data either!). This
seems like a good opportunity to do an http://isitopendata.org/
request but before starting on this I wanted to ask:

?* Does anyone out there had any ideas what was going on here?
?* Is there anyone with good Belgium (or Library) connections who
could make the request (they usually work better from someone in the
"scene")

Hello all,
 
I am honoured to see my name in the company of so many well known people at http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography.
However, when I responded to a call on twitter some time ago, I actually only said that I was interested in promoting open bibliographic data. But I wanted to have more information about the ideas and objectives first. I still don't know what the OKF and this working group on open bibliographic data actually stand for. 
 
I haven't agreed to actively participate in any kind of steering committee or similar. At the moment I do not have the time for monthly calls at all; I already have lots of calls for other volunteer groups. The Library of the University of Amsterdam, my employer, is currently offering open access to their bibliographic data only through the usual interfaces (web, z39.50, sru, etc.). They are also strong advocates of open access to scientific publications. I managed to get linked data/semantic web/rdf in the short term action plans.
 
So I'm interested in promoting open bibliographic data, but I still have not enough information about OKF, and I definitely don't have time for a very active, organising role in this group.

Onderwerp: Getting started with the Working Group on Open Bibliographic Data



Welcome to the new list for the Working Group on Open Bibliographic
Data! A list of current members and the group's purpose is at:

  http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography

In terms of next steps, the first instance I propose:

  1. We make sure that we have broad representation from existing
projects and initiatives interested in open bibliographic data. It
would be great if everyone could cast their eyes over the list to see
if there are any obvious omissions!
  2. We find a regular slot to have monthly virtual meetings. I
suggest we do this on a weekday in the late afternoon/early evening
GMT, e.g. 1700 GMT / 1800 CET / 0900 PST.
  3. Once we have done 1. and 2., we aim to launch the working group
in the next few weeks?

How does this sound?

All the best,

I've recently created an RDF interface for our EPrints software. Our 
school is running the latest version, and the RDF is visible here:
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/id/repository

Some examples of using the data are here:
http://lemur.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~cjg/Graphite/eprints.php

Many other universities will (hopefully) upgrade to the new version and 
gain an RDF output.

On reflection, I would prefer IRC to skype too.

You may find interest in this from the OAI-PMH community, too.

Yep, my OpenID is http://jakoblog.de/. I'd like to improve the
description of formats (have not found out how to add tags in CKAN) and
could add some dumps from German libraries.

Cheers,

"Customer may use the Service for bibliographic research purposes in the internal operation of its organization only or, if Customer is an individual, for his/her personal use only."

This clause appears to forbid republication of any bibliographic metadata assembled through the
MyReferences system.
If MyReferences users have some other terms of RefWorks service which would allow them to republish
bibliographic metadata acquired through RefWorks licensing, I would be delighted to learn that
and to cooperate with MyReferences users to enlarge and improve the pool of open biblio metadata.

clear. I would advocate removing those aspects that contradict this clear
statement - but it may be this has too many consequences at this stage, I
don't know.

I'm in favour of this approach - whether for librarians or others.

Fair question - I'm probably not sure what I mean either. I guess I was just
seeing several pieces of work that seem to be heading in the same direction
and asking the question of whether there are synergies that can be
expoited.
