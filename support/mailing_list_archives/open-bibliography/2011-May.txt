Thanks to Jonathan for posting this, and Jim for the discussion.

The list at http://obd.jisc.ac.uk/examples points to CKAN as the list in itself isn't meant to be exhaustive, but as a way for people exploring the use cases around which the guide is based to see real world examples of open data release.

In terms of the licensing the list is just one page within the guide, and it is the guide that is licensed as CC-BY

Owen

PS in terms of the CrossRef data - I've not seen anything relating to the licensing of this data - if anyone has any information on this it would be welcome

I went to the OBD meeting earlier this year and AFAIK the examples weren't
present then. Their addition is useful

My understanding of ODB is that it created resource for managers to decide
when and where Open Bibliography mattered to them. A prospectus or
whitepaper, fixed in time. So the examples are simply examples, though
useful.

My personal interpretation was that OBD was aimed mainly at managers and
will have whatever force JISC documents have on managers (I have no idea how
widely this sort of thing is used). Owen - please correct.

Hopefully it will bring our OB activities to the notice of those managers.

But we have to continue the struggle to liberate bibliographic data.

Update on the JSON-LD vs RDF/JSON issues.

We can build a valid JSON document with JSON-LD. It seems we missed
part of the description. However there are still some issues with the
spec being incomplete.

Do we have scope to influence additions to the spec?

Quoting the web site:

There are several ways that you can collaborate in the development of JSON-LD:

This is quite exciting, looking forward to doing some measurements on
how much of which type of information we actually have in
there. Unfortunately I think that the best we will be able to do in
the near term is make dumps available as this really is an enormous
amount of data and we lack the resources to put it, e.g. in a
triplestore.

Hello,

the LOCAH project has published its first test dataset under a CC0
public domain waiver. For more information about the release of this
archival data see the mail form Adrian Stevenson below. Does anybody
know whether there also is a full dump available?

In the announcement, also the project is mentioned to publish COPAC as
Linked Data in a month time. Hopefully, this library catalog also will
be published under CC0.

Cheers
Adrian

Dear All

On behalf of the UK JISC-funded LOCAH Project: Linked Open Copac and
Archives Hub [1], I'm very pleased to announce the release of
http://data.archiveshub.ac.uk, our first Linked Data set. The project
is making records from the Archives Hub service [2] and Copac service
[3] available as Linked Data. The Archives Hub is an aggregation of
archival metadata from repositories across the UK; Copac provides
access to the merged library catalogues of libraries throughout the
UK, including all national libraries.

More information about the release is available on our project blog at
http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/locah/2011/05/09/archives-hub-linked-data-release/.
We encourage feedback on the data, the model and any other aspect of
data.archiveshub.ac.uk, so please leave comments or contact us
directly.

I would personally like to thank the LOCAH team for all their hard
work on this exciting and challenging project. I?d also like to thank
our technology partner, Talis [4] for kindly providing our Linked Data
store.

	26th May
Message-ID: <F65EAED4-151F-405D-821D-A6744B928BFF@ostephens.com>

This may be of interest - specifically licensing of metadata (bibliographic and other) will be part of the discussion, and also looking at ways such open metadata might be exploited.

How can we better serve UK educators and researchers to excel in their work by increasing access to and visibility of relevant content?
The work of the Resource Discovery Taskforce has entered a new phase of active implementation. This conference marks the launch of ?Discovery: a metadata ecology for UK education and research?, a programme of activity that will build critical mass through opening up data, exploring and demonstrating what open data makes possible, and actively addressing barriers to progress in this critical agenda for the future of libraries, archives and museums.

The Discovery conference will address and debate challenges from researchers in both humanities and sciences
Chaired by Professor David Baker, Deputy Chair of the JISC Board, and Nick Poole of Collections Trust
?         Hear from Dr Stuart Lee at Oxford University and Professor Peter Murray-Rust at Cambridge University arguing the case for what researchers need to fuel their discovery, then participate in the Research Conversation on how to respond to those challenges
?         Participate in the Teaching and Learning Conversation to share your ideas on assessing and responding to student expectations, with input from Dr Drew Whitworth at Manchester University
?         In the afternoon, work with the Discovery team to look at opportunities for taking action around special collections and aggregation services
?         Contribute your ideas to the Big Event session ? a new initiative to set up a focal point for exploring content from a number of different sources as a catalyst for collaboration
?         Hear about a new strategy to make progress on licensing issues
 
Venue: Wellcome Trust, Gibbs Building, 215 Euston Road, London, NW1 2BE
Date: Thursday 26th May 2011, 10.00am-4.00pm
 
Who should attend? Leaders and managers, practitioners, developers and advocates from libraries, archives, museums, associated publishers and interested organisations, who want early involvement in making digital content easy to find, share and re-use.

At it?s annual member meeting Thursday last week, the Swedish Library Association decided to add promotion of free, shareable, open bibliographic data to it?s Orientation of Activities for 2012-2013. This addition was suggested by Christina Persson, head of the Gothenburg city library, and was approved by the members who attended the meeting. The meeting has given the library association board mandate to formulate this new addition to the Orientation of Activities.

Information in English regarding the Swedish Libriary Association and its Orientation of Activities for 2010-2011 is found at http://www.biblioteksforeningen.org/english/base.html.

I will distribute more information to this list as it becomes available.

This is fantastic news Anders! Do you think Christina might be

would be great if you could invite her to join the OKF's Working Group

Message-ID: <4DD66BE5020000140003F752@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

After the success of the "Semantic Web in Libraries" (SWIB) events in 2009 and 2010, the SWIB11 will take place in Hamburg from 28 to 30 November 2011. The conference will again be organised by the NorthRhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz), Cologne, and the German National Library of Economics - Leibniz Information Centre forEconomics (ZBW), Kiel and Hamburg.
 
A rising number of actors in librarianship and its related fields areexperimenting with Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open Data (LOD). The LOD cloud as a whole grew by 300% in 2010, whereas the amount of data relevant for libraries grew by nearly 1000%. The W3C has created a "Linked Library Data" group to observe this development, whose first report is due to be published in August. The "Semantic Web Special Interest Group" established by IFLA shows that this topic has shown up on their radar as well. At the same time, the principles and workflows of traditional scientific communication and publication are under scrutiny with a view to a consistently web-based data and service infrastructure comprising the entire research and publication process. Concepts like "nano-publications", "Semantic Publishing", "Open Data", "Enhanced Publications" or "Research Objects" mark the re-orientation of academic work, away from monolithic, comparatively unflexible and barely interlinked reference points towards a distributed, comparatively granular data infrastructure which is continuously accessible to researchers and into which their contributions recognizably return.
 
These are the questions and topics which we would like to discuss with you at the conference:
 
* How do I find my way around the LOD cloud and how do I achieve maximum visibility for my assets?
* How do we produce useful links to and between newly published datasets?
* Where do we find best practice examples for LOD-based applications which show the added value created by linking assets, in particulardomain-overlapping assets?
* What are the trends in scholarly communication? What are the consequences of the transformation of traditional research and publication processes for libraries and what are the opportunities Linked Open Data can offer here?
* Library Authority Files and their potential as LOD for library applications or research information systems
* What could or should a future Linked Open Data infrastructure look like? Are there trends to adapt library applications or research environments to the Semantic Web and to support their users in RDF
  publishing?
* Open licences as a prerequisite for LOD-based infrastructures
* What kind of support is to be expected from W3C, international and national bodies for future development?
 
These are our topics for SWIB11. Do you have an interesting project or research topic that should be presented at the conference? We would like to receive suggestions and proposals for contributions (with a brief abstract, no more than one page) until 20 June 2011. The conference will be held in German, but contributions in English are welcome. Please send them electronically to:

Subject: [open-bibliography] Misciting identifiers (openbiblio workshop
	follow-up)
Message-ID: <4DDA74AE.2040107@oucs.ox.ac.uk>


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,

At the openbiblio workshop it was suggested that I try to quantify
what proportion of citations were incorrect in some way. To start
doing this, I've been visualising the networks produced when one
groups references to papers by common identifiers. It seems that DOIs
are vastly more often wrong than any other type of identifier.


Were the world perfect, each group would contain at most one of each
type of identifier, and each reference would be a close match for each
other reference in that group. Where a reference miscites an
identifier it will generally stick out from the network it becomes
part of.

So, I'd like to present a lot of pretty graphs:
<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/>. Here, coloured nodes are
references to papers (either citations, NLM XML headers from the OA
subset, or the result of querying the pubmed API for a header for a
particular PMID). The different colours represent groups of references
clustered by similarity. The white nodes are identifiers, with the
shape representing the scheme (DOI, PMID, PMC, URI, etc). The edges
mean "this paper is associated with this identifier".

Having done this it seems that there are a few different types of
miscitation, so I've picked out some exemplars:


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000119.png>

The lone green thing is a citation that likely has an incorrect DOI.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000103.png>

This is probably a failure of my clustering, though I can't be sure
without checking.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000514.png>

This looks to be a bug in the data returned by the pubmed API. There are
a number of PMIDs that elicit a DOI of '10.1093/aje/'. e.g.
<http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esummary.fcgi?db=pubmed&rettype=xml&id=15583373>.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000142.png>

Awkward in that it's impossible to work out which citation of that DOI
in the middle is correct.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000534.png>

This one looks rather clear cut.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000546.png>

This one looks odd as the green cluster are so separated. The fault here
seems to be with the paper with PMID ID 20948869, where reference 26
(the far left green one) and reference 27 (the rightmost red one) have
their PMIDs swapped.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000303.png>

Also fairly clear cut.


<http://alexdutton.co.uk/reclusterings/00000256.png>

There are lots of these, and looking at the data behind them, the stuff
that comes back from the API looks nothing like the data on the reference.

Hello,

here is a very interesting post by John Mark Ockerbloom pointing out
that OCLC is now considering open data licensing (ODC-BY):

http://everybodyslibraries.com/2011/05/24/open-datas-role-in-transforming-our-bibliographic-framework/

This topic that was addressed by OKFN already in 2007[1] now finally
gets broader attention. There's much of OKFN material used in OCLC's

There is some "yeah, but..." to this story. When Karen Calhoun said at  
the recent members council meeting that OCLC is considering the ODC-BY  
license, she also said that they still consider the OCLC record use  
policy to be in force. It appears that they consider these two -- the  
license and the policy -- to be able to co-exist. The policy states  
that any "down stream" users must abide by the policy, which has  
stricter requirements than ODC-BY. I found the announcement by Calhoun  
to be puzzling. In addition, she said this on a panel about linked  
data. Since linked data refers to metadata statements, not records or  
files, again it isn't clear how any license based on records and files  
can be pertinent.

Not to mention the fact that Karen Calhoun has quite suddenly  
announced her retirement at the end of this month.

It's all mysterious.

I can't let this personal jab go by without comment. I consider Karen
Calhoun a friend as well as a respected colleague. The comment above seems
aimed to cast aspersions where none should be cast. Any announcement of
someone leaving their current employer is "quite sudden" by its very nature.

In reality, Karen has been sliding toward this for quite some time. Her
family (she has grandkids) live in the Pittsburgh area and she has been
increasingly spending time there. A natural progression toward full
retirement offered itself, where she could work part-time at the University
of Pittsburgh, consult with OCLC as we work to fill the rather large void
she will leave here, and spend more time with her family. I will not stand
idly by while insinuations are made that are completely without merit.

Damn it!  I was getting all optimistic for a few hours there!

So it won't be simply ODC-BY (which I forget what that is) but
ODC-BY+OCLC-usage-policy... which isn't really ODC-BY then.

I simply don't understand why a cooperative wants that record use
policy.  "Co-operatives are based on the values of self-help,
self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity and solidarity. In
the tradition of their founders, co-operative members believe in the
ethical values of honesty, openness, social responsibility and caring
for others." (from www.ica.coop)  OK, it might have been adopted
democratically, while solidarity and social responsibility are probably
arguable, but several of the others seem less so.

Of course, I didn't find the ICA values on oclc.org just now!
The OCLC values and principles that you can download from
http://www.oclc.org/us/en/about/cooperation/governance/default.htm 
are very different.  If they lose the argument in court over whether
they are a co-op, I think those unusual values and principles may be
part of the reason.

That's what I heard Calhoun say. The slide states:

Our preliminary thoughts on Open Data Licensing
?We are considering recommending ODC-BY
?Distinguishes between the database and its contents (or portions of contents)
?[Member DATABASE NAME] would be the name of the member?s or group?s  
catalog, and the member or group = the licensor
?License notice wording in accordance with instructions in ODC licenses
?Still under investigation?your input invited and welcome

I'm not totally discouraged -- there are folks at OCLC who understand  
LOD and there are some interesting LD efforts there (http://dewey.info  
and http://viaf.org). I really think that the LOD "tsunami" will have  
an effect on OCLC, and we'll see movement in that direction. To my  
mind the best approach is to continue to develop LOD and to continue  
to raise awareness.

I had a call this morning with a group of open data advocates in  
Italy, and they report the same issues that many are finding, which is  
that the actual legal status of library data is unknown. Continuing  
that conversation in all available venues is going to be a key  
"consciousness raising" act; the more we understand that issue widely  
in our community the more we will find an expectation of openness.  
That expectation is our strongest weapon.

We also need to educate people about LD -- that linked data  is not a  
database dump but is an interaction between data created by different  
people possibly in different communities. I think this will ease some  
of the fears that people have. I try to explain that letting people  
link to you does not change your data anymore than letting people link  
to your web site changes the site. It's possible that we can reconcile  
business models and linking when this is better understood.

Hello,

I don't see it necessarily as a problem that the "policy" should
co-exist with an open data recommendation. The policy isn't legally
binding anyway but a "social contract".

Obviously, it would be contradictory to recommend open data and forbid
single libraries to publish their data under an open license as OCLC
tried to do through the policy. Actually, the answers OCLC gave to my
questions on open data in the community forum in 2010[1] should then
be invalid and superseded by a recommendation for open data (in the
case this recommendation is really made by OCLC.)

I read this like OCLC may choose a similar approach that the hbz and
another German library service center (BSZ) have chosen to open up a
union catalog: OCLC basically would recommend open licensing for parts
of WorldCat. If a member library or group wants to follow the
recommendation, OCLC publishes the data with holdings from the member
or member group as Open Data under an ODC-BY license. This is my take
on interpreting these slides. Roy, it would be good if you could bring
some more clarity into this...

Cheers
Adrian

I agree with Adrian. An actual open license issued by OCLC would, I think,
supercede the policy. One of my main critiques of the policy is that I
find it vague. An actual license should make things clearer. However, all
my dealings with OCLC have ended with a "yeah, but.." or, as the FAQ
attached to the police answers every question: "Yes. Please note,
however..." I would actually prefer a straight no.

As regards to Karens notes about LD, I haven't met any fear of it. Rather
reactions like "Interesting, but how can it actually solve my problem? I
have a vendor that is willing to do this for me right now, if I only sign
this contract, and I need the issue solved, not wait for something that
_might_ solve my problems in a few years!"

As far as I can tell, this only refers to OCLC members releasing data  
from their own library catalogs. That's also what the record use  
policy covers: members sharing their catalog data with others. OCLC  
does contract for use of WorldCat data, as it has with Google for  
GoogleBooks. That's unrelated to the policy.

We had an interesting discussion with Karen this week regarding this as 
part of our work with the on the COMET project. It appears that OCLC are 
indeed considering ODC-By as the recommended license for libraries 
wishing to share data derived from Worldcat.

My personal understanding was that this licensing was seen as being 
compatible (in terms of a legal substitute rather than an addition) with 
the rights and responsibilities of members whereas PDDL was not. 
Hopefully someone from OCLC can give us some clarification and greater 
specifics on this.

Karen mentioned her upcoming retirement, indicated that was there was a 
clear handover path in place for her work on Open Data and that they 
have been consulting with acknowledged legal experts in Open Data 
licensing. They next hope to gain feedback from the library community 
and beyond on this issue, especially with regards to how attribution 
would work in practice.

I'd be personally interested in the Open Data community's feelings on 
attribution licensing for data in general. Thoughts and ideas are good, 
but practical examples of where it has inconvenienced, disrupted or 
conversely assisted efforts would be very welcome.

 From a library point of view, I can see some advantage in having 
attribution retained, given that our hard work in creating an original 
record is acknowledged.

 From a developer point of view, I can only imagine it working in 
practice if OCLC give clear guidelines on attribution and make it 
painless. Quite how attribution would work in an 'ecology' of linked 
data is also something I'd also welcome thoughts and opinions on.

I think its also worth highlighting that OCLC have clearly realised that 
non-commercial licensing is not suitable for bibliography, and have also 
avoided the mis-step of trying to 'roll their own' license. This is in 
itself a very good sign.

Whilst I have a personal preference for PDDL/CC0 due to ease of 
consumption, I feel that if OCLC do adopt an Open Data Common License 
recommendation it will still be a major step forward for libraries 
wishing to share data on a wider scale.

Best wishes

I wonder if anyone from OCLC might be interested in writing a short
piece for blog.okfn.org about their recent thinking in relation to
open data? If so it would be great if they could contact me off-list!
