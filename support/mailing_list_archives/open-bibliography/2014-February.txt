Subject: [open-bibliography] Bibtex parser in Python
Message-ID: <52EE9C6A.1050205@sciunto.org>

Hi,

I planned a long time ago to write an email as Peter asked me, but it
was delayed. Sorry for that.

Few months ago, I asked the permission to OKFN to reuse a part of the
code of a project to write a standalone bibtex parser in python.
In short, the OKFN project (bibserver) is under AGPL and we (users and
I) wanted to have something like LGPL.

So, the project is there: https://bibtexparser.readthedocs.org

I used OKFN project because it was the best bibtex parser I could find
in Python. Sounds odd, but no real library was available. Thus, I
decided to start this project.
My contribution is mainly to refactor the code, add unittest,
documentation and so on.

If I looked for a bibtex parser, it's because I like to write scripts to
facilitate the tasks I have to do every day. One of them is citebib:
http://citebib.readthedocs.org/
The idea: I have a large database with all papers I know and I want to
pick up some of them easily (to write emails, latex documents...).

I also tried different things to organize ideas around my bibliography.
How to highlight interesting information, gather them, put in relation
different papers... I tried docear a bit, the mind map concept is nice,
but it looks too complicated for me (too many features) and I also
appreciate CLI so the heavy GUI was a pain.
I'm currently using ikiwiki to organize my notes, but it's not ideal so
far to keep my ideas about bibliography (but i love it to record
experimental results, links....)

My hope is that libraries like bibtexparser can help other devs to make
their own tools.

Cheers,

Hi,

This looks great. I wonder, have you looked at pybliographer? That's what I've been using for scripting, although I'm not very content.

Hello,

I am not available tomorrow and thus have to postpone February's
openbiblio meeting to next week (Tuesday, 10 February). The etherpad
with the agenda etc. is at
http://pad.okfn.org/p/37th-open-bibliography-meeting
Please add agenda points that you would like to discuss.

All the best

Subject: [open-bibliography] Linked Data for Libraries (LD4L) project
Message-ID: <CAOtd05E7qngbWk1FhuCXK44B2XbenA7V+1vrAeDW4-TcUO_zGQ@mail.gmail.com>

The Mellon-funded Linked Data for Libraries (LD4L) project at Cornell,
Harvard and Stanford might bring things forward regarding the
availability of open bibliographic data on the web. See the recent
blog post on the project by David Weinberger.[1]

In the December announcement[2] of the project from Harvard it reads:
"Ultimately, the goal of the project is to create a system that pulls
information out of its existing silos?like library catalogs, finding
aids, reading lists and more?into a common format that people can use
to  find and understand information. This new system would apply to
all scholarly and creative disciplines, including the sciences, the
arts and  the humanities."

The question is whether the project's goal is linked _open_ data, i.e.
publishing large amounts of bibliographic data for journal articles
etc. under an open license. Or whether the goal is to have the data on
the web as linked data but without open licensing...

Can anybody on this list provide some more information on this project
regarding openbiblio data?

If it's going to be called LOD then it has to have an Open licence (first
star of TimBL). If it isn't Open, use the LOD hammer to make them make it
Open.

>From Dean Krafft, the instigator of the Mellon Linked Data project:
-----

The goal is, in fact, to do Linked Open Data. Here's the appropriate
language from page 3 of the proposal:



"While Linked Data can be used internally within an institution or across a
collaborative group, it becomes much more valuable when it is Linked
*Open* Data,
and is publicly shared using an open license such as the Creative Commons
CC-BY[1] <https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#143f8efc726ed2dd__ftn1> or
CC0[2] <https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#143f8efc726ed2dd__ftn2>
licenses,
or the United Kingdom's Open Government
License[3]<https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?shva=1#143f8efc726ed2dd__ftn3>.
For our Linked Data for Libraries project, our intention is that all SRSIS
instances will share Linked Open Data with the world."



Since we're publishing our own metadata, and we don't actually have a lot
of metadata for journal articles, there won't be a lot of that in the mix.
But what we do have should definitely be open.

Thanks Adrian.  Does anyone have any information on what they're actually
doing?  Is this going to result in yet another mega dump of
unreconciled/unlinked bibliographic RDF data or are they actually going to
make an attempting at linking things in a useful fashion?

Stanford was actually involved in a linked data experiment back in 2010
when a good chunk of their catalog was loaded into Freebase and matched up
with Freebase topics.  You can see a list of the book editions here:
https://www.freebase.com/authority/stanford/control?links&lang=en&sort=timestamp
If you look at an edition, you'll see that they're each linked back to the
Stanford OPAC system. For example, these two editions:
    https://www.freebase.com/m/075ngj1
    https://www.freebase.com/m/0c60n0m
are linked both their original catalog entries and to this work:
    https://www.freebase.com/m/075nhtg
and the topic for the author Donn Byrne
<https://www.freebase.com/m/02x79g1> which
is further linked to Wikipedia, OpenLibrary, VIAF, IMDB, and LC NAF.

That's all a long-winded way of saying that Stanford University Library has
a pretty good start on producing Linked Data today.

Cornell has some linked data for their OPAC too, although I don't think its
as extensive as the Stanford data.  I think it's mostly derived from the
metadata associated with Google Books scans.  If you look at this
edition<https://www.freebase.com/m/04w0sxn> of
Flatland <https://www.freebase.com/m/0j_mj> you can see that it's linked to
both Cornell's OPAC as well as the LC and OpenLibrary records for that
edition, while the work entry is linked to Wikipedia and
ISFDB<http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?1933>.
 (It should be linked to the OpenLibrary work page too, but OpenLibrary
didn't yet have works when the original Freebase linking was done, so
that's a gap in the linkage.

(apologies if I'm just re-posting info already seen)

I think @azaroth42 [twitter] might be a good man to ask for details on
this.. Some responses to the "and we're off" posting, asking about license
etc here:
http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2014/02/01/linked-data-for-libraries-and-were-off/....

..Yes, we are aiming at public domain. The following is from page 3 of the
proposal:

"While Linked Data can be used internally within an institution or across a
collaborative group, it becomes much more valuable when it is Linked Open
Data, and is publicly shared using an open license such as the Creative
Commons CC-BY[1] or CC0[2] licenses, or the United Kingdom's Open
Government License[3]. For our Linked Data for Libraries project, our
intention is that all SRSIS instances will share Linked Open Data with the
world."

Dean Krafft adds: Since we're publishing our own metadata, and we don't

of that in the mix. But what we do have should definitely be open.

Since the aim is to demonstrate library Linked Data's practical value  for
scholarly/educational communities, we'll do as much reconciliation/linking
as we can, which will inevitably be less than we'd like.

We're pretty much at Day #2 of this project. There will be more details as
we work through the issues, preferably with the advice and help of the
entire community, including you.

Thank you all for your responses.

I had previously heard about Cornell's project to provide unified discovery
via a blacklight (open source) interface and wondered whether the LD4L
project would address the whole range of the data underlying discovery
tools or just the catalog metadata. I hoped that libraries would move one
step further with addressing free reuse/open licensing of metadata in
contract negotiations with content providers. (See also the openbiblio blog
post in reaction to the EBSCO and Ex Libris slap fight:
http://openbiblio.net/2013/06/23/discovery-silos-vs-the-open-web/.)

David, please let us know if there is any chance if the project might also
address this issue. Someone will have to make a start...

- Adrian

We're very much focused on going beyond catalog data. But making licensed
journal metadata public isn't part of our charter. We'd like it and support
it, but it's not going to be where we're spending our time.

Indeed, yes, a long time ago but It looked too sophisticated to me
(probably because my coding skills are too limited). I really prefer a
KISS piece of code, and OKFN did that. Nevertheless, it would be a good
idea to reuse their tests to check the project's code.

Hi Ed, you should be able to find the parsers in the bibserver repository,
in the parser plugins folder:

Message-ID: <52FDFDBA.2050607@kcoyle.net>

I don't have the details of the contract, but I have learned that, after 
about 10 years of discussions, OCLC has agreed that the National Library 
of Sweden can release OCLC-derived records in its LIBRIS catalog under a 
CC0 license. This is good news, and let's hope that it sets a precedent 
for other libraries.

That's very good news. Do we assume that the records originally "belonged"
to OCLC because they built the system. Is there anything specially related
to national libraries in this?

When we started the JISC Open Bibliography project (was it 5 years ago?)
one goal was to work with the BL on Open Bibliography and during the
project they released the Brit Nat Bibliography as CC0. Other national
libraries have followed suit. So can we now make an effective case that
this should be the norm for all national libraries?

The gist of OCLC's justification is that they have put a lot of effort 
into maintaining record quality. They not only store them, they also 
merge duplicate records, update records with new authority information, 
and make changes necessitated by changes in the MARC formats. For 
records that come into the database in non-MARC formats, they transform 
the records into decent MARC. In terms of protecting the OCLC database, 
I think it's obvious that they have that right. It's once the records 
leave OCLC that the question comes up. I think of it as something like 
the US "first sale" doctrine: once you've sold something to someone 
else, it's theirs, and you can no longer control it. It is the attempt 
to control down-stream use that goes too far.

  Is there anything
> specially related to national libraries in this?

Not that I know of.

That might be a stretch given legal and situational differences. (There 
are over 150 national libraries that participate in IFLA, if I remember 
correctly.) But it could surely be an aspiration.

Excellent news. Get one more national library to agree, and, yes, let's
claim it's the new norm! :)

Also, just a reminder that in April 2012, OCLC agreed to let Harvard
release its (Harvard's) catalog data as CC0, including records that
benefited from OCLC's data enhancement as per Karen's msg.

Dear all,

The European Library (http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/)  is currently working with all National Libraries in Europe to produce CC0 Linked Open Data related to their bibliographic datasets . We had hoped to get this published in January, but it's taking a bit longer with some of the libraries less familiar with CC0.

We are also working with the RLUK (Research Libraries UK) consortium to do the same for data about their library holdings (about 30 UK research libraries, plus Trinity in Dublin)

I spoke to Adrian about this a while back at one of the meetings - he might be able to locate the notes

Happy to speak more about this as required.

Alastair

While Sharepoint 2013 offers more metadata capabilities than ever before,
the range of options can make it hard to implement the most effective way.
Management of controlled vocabularies is a particular challenge. This
tutorial will enable you to pick the brains of an experienced consultant,
Marc Stephenson of Metataxis.

*b) Workshop: Vocabularies and the potential for linkage (9.30 - 12.30)*

Various approaches to the linkage of value vocabularies (KOSs) and/or
element set vocabularies (metadata schemas) will be described by *Pierre-Yves
Vandenbussche* (Fujitsu, Ireland), *Dan Brickley* (Google), *Gordon Dunsire*
 and *Stella Dextre Clarke*, with emphasis on the opportunities as well as
the barriers to widespread adoption. After that is a case study from *Johan
De Smedt* and *Agis Papantoniou*, both of TenForce, that draws on more than
one technique. The subsequent discussion will address the prospects for
take-up, aiming to help participants with application or development of
similar techniques and projects.

*AFTERNOON MEETING (Plenary, 14.00 - 18.00)*

--*Martin White*: The importance of metadata for high quality Search
--*Sean Bechhofer*: Wf4Ever: metadata for "Research Objects"
--*Mark Sandler*: Semantic Media: a new paradigm for navigable content for
the 21st century
--*Richard Ranft*: Enhancing discovery of the British Library's audio
collections
--*Antoine Isaac*: A portrait of Europeana as a Linked Open Data case (in
progress)
--*Andrew MacFarlane*: Analysing creative image search queries to determine

*About BCS IRSG*
Established in 1978, the main aim of the BCS IRSG is supporting the
communication between information retrieval (IR) researchers and
practitioners, promoting the use of IR methods in industry and raising
public awareness of IR-related topics. Recognizing IR as an
interdisciplinary field, a further aim of the BCS IRSG is to act as a link
between computer science, library and information science and also cognate
communities (like natural language processing).

*About DCMI*
