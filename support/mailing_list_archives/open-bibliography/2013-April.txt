******************Please excuse the cross postings******************

Join NISO/DCMI for our joint April webinar

--Webinar: Deployment of RDA (Resource Description and Access) Cataloging
and its Expression as Linked Data
--Date: April 24, 2013
--Time: 1:00 - 2:30 p.m. (Eastern Time - UTC 17:00:00) (World Clock:
http://bit.ly/XySJt0)
--Event webpage: http://www.niso.org/news/events/2013/dcmi/rda/

=========================================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR:

A seminar at the British Library in April 2012 marked the fifth anniversary
of a 2007 meeting at which representatives of the Dublin Core, Semantic
Web, and RDA communities jointly recommended that the then-draft cataloging
standard RDA be provided in the form of vocabularies and application
profiles usable for Linked Data.

One year after this anniversary meeting and one year closer to the general
deployment of RDA in libraries, this webinar will take stock of progress
towards developing application profiles based on RDA and discuss the
practicalities of exposing RDA-based data in the Linked Data cloud.

SPEAKER:

Alan Danskin, Metadata Standards Manager at The British Library, where he
has worked in various capacities since 1987, including implementation of
MARC 21.  He currently represents the library on the Joint Steering
Committee for the Development of RDA (Resource Description and Access) for
which he until recently served as chair. He has served as chair of the
Cataloguing & Indexing Group of the Chartered Institute of Library and
Information Professionals and is a member of the Book Industry
Communication Bibliographic Standards Group.

Registration closes one hour before the webinar begins.

Subject: NISO Publishes Annual Year in Review Issue of Information
Standards Quarterly
To: PACS-P at listserv.uh.edu


The Spring 2013  issue of the National Information Standard Organization?s
Information Standards Quarterly magazine?providing a summary of the 2012
standards development work conducted by NISO and by the international ISO
Information and Documentation committee (TC46)?has been published in open
access on the NISO website. NISO provides this Year in Review issue on an
annual basis to keep readers apprised of all the accomplishments of our
community in the past year.

?NISO has a very active standards and recommended practices development
pipeline with more than 20 active projects,? explains Nettie Lagace, NISO?s
Associate Director for Programs. ?In 2012, we published two new standards,
the revision of a two-part standard, two new recommended practices, two
recommended practice revisions, and a new white paper. We also launched
three new initiatives and were awarded two new grants from The Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation. These are all described in more detail in this issue of
ISQ.?

?NISO?s role as the U.S. Administrator for the ISO TC46 Committee on
Information and Documentation and the Secretariat for the subcommittee on
Identification and Description ensures that our community has an active role
in international standards development as well,? said Cynthia Hodgson, ISQ
Managing Editor and a consultant for NISO who helps manage the ISO work.
?Our members not only vote on these ISO standards ballots, they also provide
critical comments to the development working groups and volunteer to be
members of these groups to help shape these international standards. This
issue summarizes the work of TC 46 and its four subcommittees during 2012.?

?Standards and recommended practice development is only possible through the
dedicated efforts of knowledgeable volunteers throughout the community,?
states Todd Carpenter, NISO?s Executive Director. ?Nothing NISO accomplishes
could have happened without the tremendous efforts and support of our
community of volunteers. The successes of the past year are a perfect
example of that and as an organization we have much to be proud of, which is
clearly illustrated in this issue.?

The Spring issue also contains a standard spotlight article on the Journal
Article Tag Suite (JATS), a new standard based on an older specification,
originally developed at the National Library of Medicine. Also included in
the issue is the annual reference listing of all of NISO?s published
standards, recommended practices, and technical reports.

The Spring issue of Information Standards Quarterly is available
electronically in open access from the NISO website at:
www.niso.org/publications/isq/. ISQ is also available in print format by
subscription or in print on demand.

	Studies!
Message-ID: <CAB53Ly6eQq+UBtgJ8L7VVnnj7frdE8mkMpWyKMpbEvyhD7UnNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

The Open Research Data Handbook - a collaborative and volunteer-led guide
to Open Research Data practices - is beginning to take shape. We?ll be
asking for comment on the first few chapters soon.

We now need your help to gather *concrete case studies* which detail your
experiences of working with Open Research Data. Specifically, we are
looking for:
* Stories of the benefits you have seen as a result of Open Research Data
practices
* Challenges you have faced in open research, and how you overcame them
* Case studies of tools you have used to share research data or to make it
openly available
* Examples of how failing to follow open research practices has hindered
the progress of research (including but not limited to science)
* ... More ideas from you!

Case studies should be around 200-500 words long. They should be concrete,
based on real experiences, and should focus on one specific angle of open
research data (you can submit more than one study!).

To find out more and register your interest, please visit this blog post
and form<http://blog.okfn.org/2013/04/09/open-research-data-handbook-call-for-case-studies/>
.

As we are keen to gather studies from diverse groups, please do circulate
this email to friends, colleagues and any relevant mailing lists.

We also welcome volunteers to help with drafting and editing the book. To
contact the team directly, please email researchhandbook at okfn.org.

We look forward to reading your open research data stories!

All the best,
Michelle (from the Open Research Data Handbook team)

The gathering is mostly relevant to SF folks, but the repository is for
all.  :D

Congrats to anyone on the list that has worked on getting the DPLA live

Sorry to barge in here, but the TSK piece on the Mendeley/Elsevier deal
needs to be put in the right context, specifically the context of that post
being written by an avowed enemy of open access who has spent the past
several years attacking PLOS, Mendeley, eLife, PeerJ, Science Exchange, and
essentially everything with a whiff of innovation about it.

 if you're looking for good perspectives on the Mendeley/Elsevier deal, I
recommend these:

Dear List Members,


I must apologise for hastily posting that article with no word of context wishing for it simply to serve as a useful counterpoint and perhaps as a basis for further debate.


Unfortunately, I wasn't aware of the long running disputes between the author and some of the core community members of the Open Science and Open Access working groups. Nor did I know quite how distorted some of the authors earlier pieces on a similar topic had been.


if I'd been aware of either of those things it would have caused me to think twice about posting to the list without qualification.


@William - thanks for supplying some much needed context and some other writing with more constructive perspectives!


Apologies if my posting gave the wrong impression, ?I appreciate how hard you guys are working to keep this sort of guff a minority opinion and in many ways the less said about TSK the better! :)


All the best,
Sam

No problems Sam,
I've come in for flak from TSK - being labelled as "an ignorant chemist".
IMO The column is seriously and damagingly biased but occasionally has
useful material.

Agreed, nice post Jonathan. I think one thing the DPLA site might do is
allow search by copyright status, similar to how Europeana does it. That'd
be nice. Does anyone know if this is being considered? Of course, the site
just launched, so maybe it's on the to-do list.

DPLA is serving as a platform for services and metadata more than a
creator of them.  A license-sensitive search is most desirable.  DPLA
can do things such as encouraging all content hubs to include license
data per record, where they have a non-default license, and
encouraging search providers to include a license-search option,
buidling on that data.

In many cases, however, at least for material older than CC, what we
need is a service like the Durationator which can take in the
identifier for a work and look up its (c) status in a shared global
database.

Subject: [open-bibliography] More needed to define "open"
Message-ID: <5176A353.7090408@kcoyle.net>

All,

We've done a good job of defining the license terms for open 
bibliographic data, but there is another step that seems essential that 
we haven't addressed: making the data openly available, and what that 
means. One can announce a data license of CC0 but if the data itself is 
behind a paywall, or otherwise isn't available for use, then the license 
isn't doing anyone any good.

It seems to me that there are at least 2 ways that data becomes truly open:

1. There is a data dump that is openly available to anyone who wishes to 
download it. This solution has problems relating to updating, however, 
and puts the burden of making the data usable on the recipient. It's a 
solution, but perhaps not the best.

2. The data owner provides an open interface that allows searching and 
linking. Linking needs to be bi-directional -- that the data can link 
out, but also that others can "link in."

I've probably expressed this poorly, but that should just give others an 
incentive to develop this thought further. :-)

Statics dumps are much easier to create than continually updated resources
and if they are of high quality can be very valuable. They are much easier
to work with.

The main requirement IMO is that it is possible to know the extent of the
data and *if necessary* download it systematically. That's the only way
that it is truly open - it can be forked.

I am not sure that link-in is always valuable. Can you explain? would all
consumers link in?

It's a good reminder that there are multiple things which influence
how "open" something is, but I'm not following the first part of this:

Is this in response to a real world example?  I'm having a hard time
reconciling CC0 with a paywall ToS/license.  Unless of course, someone
took CC0 data and put it behind a paywall -- which is, of course,
perfectly legal in the same way that selling GPL'd software is.

I think both bulk data dumps and APIs are useful for different types
of access, so ideally both should be offered.  Stable RDF URLs that
people can link to are also useful, but somewhat orthogonal (and their
usefulness depends on whether you've got the RDF religion or not).
Stable URLs allows linking in, but linking out is a separate problem
which requires investment.

Your point about updates hints at a whole host of issues that people
don't often think about.  Can I get updates in real-time or only
batched every N months? Do I get the updates as updates or do I have
to figure them out myself by diff'ing the two dumps?  Do I get the
provenance of who made each update (perhaps important for me to figure
out if I think they're reliable or not)?  Is the updating process a
one way street or is the database "open" enough that it accepts my
updates too and merges them back in to the master (or is there some
type of federation with multiple "master"s)?

I think you need to distinguish between open data and free service
though.  While it would be great for data consumers to say that
unlimited free API calls are  an attribute of open data, I don't think
it's reasonable to assume that service providers will donate unlimited
funding for this.

What I like to see:

1. Bulk data dumps on a regular frequent basis.  I think DBpedia does
quarterly, OpenLibrary monthly, & Freebase weekly.  I like to see at
least monthly.
2. Live updates notification/feed - this could be RSS or some type of API
3. API with a reasonable free quota that allows searching and querying
for casual users

Peter,

I find this eminently logical, although this isn't addressed in CC. PDDL 
does address this:

"1. Access

The work shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable 
reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without 
charge. The work must also be available in a convenient and modifiable 
form."  (http://opendefinition.org/okd/)

We could reference this in our policy.

Yes, but unless the data itself is fairly static, they are quickly out 
of date. For example, if you want to show library users which items are 
checked out and which are on the shelf, you need to access that info in 
real time. If you are giving access to the periodic table of the 
elements, updates are less frequent.

"download it systematically" is a great way to put this

Often, I believe, to make connections. For example, Library of Congress 
has its subject headings in linked data format. OCLC uses those subject 
headings in its linked data. From an OCLC record display you can link to 
the LC URI and see further info. However, one cannot link FROM LC TO 
OCLC because there is no API that allows that link. Therefore there 
isn't a way to create an app that pulls up OCLC records based on the LC 
subject heading URI. To cite an opposite case, Ed Summers has created a 
web site that uses your current location and pulls up Wikipedia articles 
related to that area. [1] This is a link IN to Wikipedia. "In" and "out" 
are relative, of course -- it depends on where you start, but you should 
be able to start anywhere and go anywhere.

You cannot always expect or push your world view upon others.

Linking in, is an option for the data provider if they consider and hold
your same world view for entities or your metadata in agreement.  If they
do not have the same world view as you, then they are not required to link
in (linking out).

There is nothing stopping yourself from linking out, however.

Hello,

when we worked on the "Recommendations on Releasing Library Data as
Open Data" (German original "Empfehlungen zur ?ffnung
bibliothekarischer Daten" published in October 2011 [0]) we also saw
the need to stress that openness isn't solely defined by open
licensing. Thus, these recommendations name as key elements for open
data: open access, open standards and open licenses. Also, another six
non-obligatory elements are defined (Documentation, Raw Data,
Timeliness, Structure, Non-discriminating, Sustainability). See [1]
for a draft of an English translation.

Regarding updates, the recommendations only speak of "Timeliness"
(following the Ten Principles for Opening Up Government Information
[2]) . How timeliness should be implemented concretely isn't said but
- as Karen already pointed out - that largely depends on the kind of
data that is opened up. The recommendations accknowledge this by
saying: "The data should be published in a reasonable time after its
creation. What is reasonable may vary regarding the kind of data."

Maybe that helps for your needs,Karen.

All the best
Adrian

Absolutely. Adam (Editor of the the Public Domain Review) tweeted to Dan
Cohen about this [1], but we'd still like to follow up on this with them.

I guess there are two main issues here:

  i. Copyright status of work (presumably in US in first instance) - and
here they could either do manual marking by institution (e.g. with Public
Domain Mark for things which are definitely known to be out of copyright),
and possibly could look into semi-automated with calculators, though more
work is probably needed here. Perhaps could be an interesting to do a
public domain calculation hackathon with Europeana, DPLA, WMF and others on
this topic, building on existing work in this area [2] - including with
Tulane if they plan to open up their research/code?

  ii. Rights status of digital reproductions. E.g. Public Domain Mark,
openly licensed, CC licensed, claims of copyright in digital reproductions,
etc. One would hope that the DPLA would encourage use of the Public Domain
Mark amongst contributing institutions. I don't know whether there have
been any discussions of taking a principled approach to this, as per
Bridgeman and Corel (along the lines of the Wikimedia Foundation's position
on this [3]), along the lines of their position on data, but this could be
an option.

Jonathan, my understanding has been (in the US) that making an exact 
copy does not result in any additional rights for the copy itself. The 
one exception can be for previously unpublished works -- it is not known 
whether digitization and placing online meets the criteria of 
"publication" in US copyright law. But in any case, a "slavish copy" is 
not generally eligible for any rights protection beyond those of the 
original.

That blogger didn't read the Terms of Service carefully enough.  The
actual item contents are under a potluck of licenses, but all DPLA
content (not cataloged content) *except* the metadata is released
under CC-BY.  The metadata is all explicitly CC0:

http://dp.la/info/terms/

5.2. Metadata

All Metadata has been dedicated to the public pursuant to Creative
Commons? CC0 public domain dedication, and is available for download
through DPLA?s Metadata API. Please read DPLA?s Metadata Policy for
more information regarding the Metadata.

There are actually a couple of other exceptions for previews & the
DPLA marks, so let me try again:

Metadata - all contributed metadata is CC0 (and the DPLA asserts that
they believe most of it is not copyrightable anyway)
Images, Video, & Audio on DPLA site - individually licensed per rights
statements in metadata (this covers thumbnails, previews, etc on DPLA
site)
User contributed content - CC-BY (ambiguous as to whether required
attribution is to DPLA only or original contributor)
DPLA marks, dress, look & feel - all rights reserved
Actual content - individually licensed per rights statements in
metadata (note that none of this is, currently, hosted on the DPLA
site, but on the original owning institutions sites)

A PD-calculator hackathon sounds like a great idea.  We could organize
a pair in the US and in Europe, if that makes it easier to bring the
most active people to one of the two.   SJ

In France, we were actually planning to organize one of these hackathon, to interface the current version of the public domain calculators (publicdomain.okfn.org/calculators) with a several cultural institutions in France. It could be great to launch a shared international initiative, where different countries take a bunch of metadata from their domestic glam institutions and align the national calculator to their respective format. The new version of the pd calculators allows to map different kinds of metadata to a common format internal to the calculators. This makes it possible to aggregate data from many different places into a single repository, so as to resolve the problem of improper/insufficient bibliographic metadata through aggregation. The goal would be to eventually be aligned with all standard metadata formats and to finally be able to properly test our calculators ;)

On point 2 below, you might be interested in the blog posting "Public library, not public domain" at http://www.legalgenealogist.com/blog/2013/04/19/public-library-not-public-domain/ which makes the point that while the metadata about collection items is released under a CC BY license, the content itself is not.  Furthermore, some repositories claim ownership and limit use of public domain material.  The author's conclusion:

...this is a public library, but its holdings - like those of any library - may still be protected and can not just be assumed to be public domain. We all need to take care to respect the rights of the contributors of the content and any intellectual property rights of the authors and creators.

Absolutely. Adam (Editor of the the Public Domain Review) tweeted to Dan Cohen about this [1], but we'd still like to follow up on this with them.

I guess there are two main issues here:

  i. Copyright status of work (presumably in US in first instance) - and here they could either do manual marking by institution (e.g. with Public Domain Mark for things which are definitely known to be out of copyright), and possibly could look into semi-automated with calculators, though more work is probably needed here. Perhaps could be an interesting to do a public domain calculation hackathon with Europeana, DPLA, WMF and others on this topic, building on existing work in this area [2] - including with Tulane if they plan to open up their research/code?

  ii. Rights status of digital reproductions. E.g. Public Domain Mark, openly licensed, CC licensed, claims of copyright in digital reproductions, etc. One would hope that the DPLA would encourage use of the Public Domain Mark amongst contributing institutions. I don't know whether there have been any discussions of taking a principled approach to this, as per Bridgeman and Corel (along the lines of the Wikimedia Foundation's position on this [3]), along the lines of their position on data, but this could be an option.

Thanks for checking on this.  I thought the license for the metadata was CC0 and not CC BY, but I didn't take the time to check.  I am glad to be corrected.

But the content, even if it is public domain, can still be restricted by the institution.  This is unfortunate, but not surprising.

Subject: [open-bibliography] CfP SWIB13 Semantic Web in Libraries Conference, Hamburg,
 25-27/11/2013
Message-ID: <517A9512020000140004F4BA@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

Call for Proposals: SWIB13 - Semantic Web in Libraries Conference
("Semantic Web in Bibliotheken"), 25.11. - 27.11.2013, Hamburg

Linked Open Data (LOD) has become a widespread method for the publication and management of data on the web. Many libraries and related institutions have already run projects or launched products that comply with the LOD paradigm. New projects, services and tools are emerging continuously.

The SWIB conference aims to provide substantial information on LOD developments relevant to the library world and to forster the exchange of ideas and experiences among practicioners. SWIB encourages thinking outside the box by involving participants and speakers from other domains, such as scholarly communications, museums and archives, or the publishing and news industry.

As in the years before, SWIB13 will be organized by the North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service Centre (hbz) and the ZBW - German National Library of Economics /  Leibniz Information Centre for Economics. The conference language is English.
Is there an interesting service, research topic or project that you would like to present at the conference? Or, can you offer giving a tutorial or a workshop on the afternoon of 25 November? We appreciate proposals on the following or related topics:

Projects & Applications

* publication & consumption of linked data
* integration of LOD into productive library applications
* authorities and knowledge organization systems (thesauri, classifications, ontologies)
* mash-ups (using data from different sources)
* crowdsourcing approaches

Technology (focus on Open Source software)

* semantically enhanced data publication
* data integration/enhancement/mapping
* searching/information retrieval
* linked data in library systems

Standards & Best Practices

* Bibframe, DAIA & other library specific open standards
* provenance information
* providing updates & syncing data sources
* open data licensing

We are looking forward to receiving your proposals by *26 May 2012*. 
Please include an abstract of 1000-1500 characters and submit your abstract using our website at http://swib.org (submission will be active from early May).
