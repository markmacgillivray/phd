Hi Adrian, just saw this.

This note

citations?? --> In Germany they are considered public domain. Publishers agree with that, see letter of "B??sernverein des Deutschen Buchhandels": http://www.bibliotheksverband.de/fileadmin/user_upload/DBV/vereinbarungen/Boersenverein_110707_Kataloganreicherung.pdf

Very interesting. Any chance you could do a translation of this and post to the openbiblio blog?
all the best

Dear all,

It's that time again - we're compiling the OKF quarterly newsletter :-)

We love including mentions of cool projects and stories from across
the open knowledge community - we want to help publicise all your
great work and successes over the past 3 months! If there's something
you want to share, pop me a couple of lines.

I look forward to hearing what you've all been up to!

All the best,

Theodora Middleton

Hi Theodora,

The JISC open bibliography project is wrapping up, we have written a
final report with some interesting links, and also a paper describing
the future of open bibliography for STM.

http://openbiblio.net/2011/06/30/final-product-post-open-bibliography/
http://bibserver.okfn.org/roadmap/open-bibliography-for-stm/

I think these would be interesting for the quarterly newsletter -
perhaps we could write a post on blog.okfn.org too?

Mark

Hi Theodora,

I created a framework for managing citation metadata, PDFs, and notes in a
wiki, which also enables me to share my entire note taking etc with the
whole world, including citation metadata etc. I documented it all here,
including a screencast that shows how I use it:
http://reganmian.net/wiki/researchr:start. Not sure if that would be
interesting to your newsletter?

Since many of you are heavily involved in journal article metadata,  
you might be interested in this.

http://www.niso.org/workrooms/journalmarkup

It appears to be a newer version of what was the NLM journal tagging,  
which I'm not familiar with. I have taken a very brief look at the  
citation format and it's extremely complex... complex of the type that  
I wonder if anyone will use it, if you know what I mean. Anyway, it's  
being worked on.

  Yes, thank you for drawing this to our attention.

  I am to some extend, since the Open Library Society is a 
  PubMed "vendor".

  I know what you mean. 
  
  But PubMed use it. Bar CrossRef, they are the biggest fish in the
  journal article metadata pond. The quality of their data has no
  rival. CrossRef data is pretty crappy, when you get it, that is.
  I understand many publishers have adopted it if they are
  working with PubMed.

Hi all,

we have a great open position at the Mannheim University Library, 
actually, it is "my" position, as I internally move to another one. I am 
strongly interested in finding someone already involved in Linked Open 
(Library) Data to push our projects forward together with me. The 
position is probably most interesting for Germans, however, an 
application at least of EU citizens should also be possible (I am not 
that firm in these laws). Proficiency in German is required.

Here is the link to the job description (in German):

Hi all,

Just a heads-up that we've created a new OKFN Facebook group page
(http://<http://goog_2079717438/>
facebook.com/OKFNetwork) for those in the network to find each other and
share OKFN images and related events. Would be great if you could join it so
others on Facebook can see what we're all up to (just click on the 'Like'
button).

We've also put many of our photos from #OKCon2011 up there, so if you see
your face in them, feel free to tag it and get some much-deserved virtual
credit for being around! You can also share your own photos from OKFN events
by uploading them to the group wall.

See you there!

Thanks, Adrian. I note that their wording is "no legal objections to  
indexing..." I'm not sure that translates to "not covered by  
copyright." I am especially unsure what they mean by "indexing for  
catalogue enrichment purposes." it may be clearer in the German  
original, but "indexing" isn't the same as "copying" and I think the  
issue at hand is whether one can freely make copies of this data.

Does anyone else have a different interpretation?

Hello Karen,

you are right that the wording could be more explicit but I think it
is in fact explicit enough if one regards the context of the
discussion and the wording of the German original.

In German the wording isn't that clear as well, as it says
"Erschlie?ung". In practice - and this was clear to both parties in
this discussion -"indexing"/"Erschlie?ung" means scanning the ToCs and
adding at least a pdf of the scan to the catalogue but for some also
indexing the OCRed in a search engine.

Also, the German wording makes it pretty clear that covertext and
blurb are copyrightable _in contrast to_ the prior mentioned parts of
books (which, thus, aren't copyrightable).

Interestingly, in a related note which underpins these statements, the
German National Library of Medicine since 2000 has been scanning
tables of contents of more than 600 German medical journals and 200
articles of journals in the fields nutrition, agriculture and the
environment. They OCR these ToCs, extract structured article data from
it and index it in their portals MEDPILOT and GREENPILOT. Until now
nobody objected and the resulting data (of 660 000 articles) will soon
be published under a Public Domain licence. (This might be interesting
for some on this list as only 10% of this data is contained in PubMed.
It would make a nice combination with the Medline dataset. I'll write
a blog post about it as soon the data is open.)

All the best
Adrian

Open Bibliographic Data. I'll wait till it appears - it will have a
catalytic effect as it will be a central resource of high quality.

What language does it use where? i.e. does it translate titles?

Thanks, Adrian, for the clarifications. Having this information about  
the context does help in interpreting the intent behind the wording.  
In particular, the fact that scanning of TOCs has been going on openly  
for a while proves the point. This is great news.

Add to that the announcement from the UK about the JISC bibliographic  
principles (different from ours, but we should find a way to do a  
mutual link since they have the same intent), and it sure looks to me  
like Open Bibliographic Data has reached a good momentum.

I have picked at least two other straws in the wind - and I believe that
fairly soon we shall have abundant Open Bibliographic Data.

Message-ID: <19BB7EB59CBC594D8DD9F3ACA1EB24A2034EE730@w2k3-bspex2.ad.bl.uk>

Dear all, 

 

As some of you are aware, the British Library is developing a Linked
Open Data version of the BNB. We've uploaded a subset of the BNB and
this is now available for preview. Information on how to access and
further details about the scope of the dataset, the data model, etc. are
available at: http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html

 

Please bear in mind that this is very much work in progress; we've
already identified some issues, which we are working on resolving in
time for the release of the bigger dataset. We've listed these issues,
together with other caveats at the page above. 

 

Feedback - preferably constructive ;-) - is welcome. I'm now out of the
office but back in on Wednesday 20th July. I'll be happy to take up the
discussion then.

 

Cheers

 

Corine

Hello Corine, hope you are enjoying your well deserved vacation!  This
is brilliant work, very much better than the previous RDF version,
URIs everywhere, beautiful!

A couple of tiny suggestions, first would be on the documents for the
authors, to have pointers back to their books, this will help with
follow-your-nose navigation. The second, very minor, would be to stuff
the timestamp from the MARC 005 somewhere so the age of the record can
be judged, and similarly for the creation of the RDF.

I would tend to model this last as something like,

<http://bnb.data.bl.uk/doc/resource/014938424> opmv:wasGeneratedBy [
    a opmv:Process;
    opmv:used [ ## maybe give this its own URI, but don't block on that
        a bibliographic:MarcRecord;
        dct:modified "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ" ## from 005
    ];
    opmv:wasPerformedAt [ 
        a time:Instant;
        time:inXSDDateTime "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
    ].

This also gives you a place to put any other information that may be
useful or interesting about the process for generating the RDF, such
as software used, person responsible for doing it, etc.. (notice it 
is on the /doc/ not the /id/). There are other ways to represent this
kind of information, the above is just my preference.

Icing on the cake would be to make a void:Dataset description for the
whole thing, containing information such as is on the information page
and then (possibly) link to that from the records and people tying it
all together into a neat package.

But on the whole very well done!

Cheers,

Hi,

I'm a recent MLIS graduate.  My friend told me about the Open Knowledge
Foundation and, I guess because of my degree, this working group was
recommended to me.  Through further readings, I really like the sound of
this group and would like to know how I can get more involved.

Thanks,

Hi William,

Many thanks for your kind words and suggestions. Some comments:

1. On having pointers back from docs for the authors to their books
We've been discussing materialising more inverse relationships; this is on our list of things to do. It may not happen immediately, but we do intend to update the BNB dataset, both in terms of its currency but also in terms of adding features to the RDF.

2. Adding metadata on the doc URIs about metadata 
e.g who created, published the RDF, when, license information, etc. Again this is on our list of things to do.

Could you please expand on the usefulness of including the timestamp from the 005? 

First because by doing so, you're bringing back the MARC bibliographic record into the data model. We had long discussions about that and in the end, decided not to model the MARC bib record. The only point in doing that would have been to be able to attach metadata about that MARC record, and we understood that this was of limited interest to the Linked Data community. Your suggestion seems to suggest otherwise. 

Secondly, the date contained in the 005 is the date of last transaction of the record. It could just be correcting some admin data, which we don't include in the RDF output in any case. You just don't know which bit of the record has been updated. So I don't think the 005 can tell you much reliably about the "age of the record".

3. the VoID description is in draft form, we just didn't publish it with the preview subset.

Cheers

Corine

[Copied to Open Bibliography - take care not to proliferate replies - but we
need immediate input]

Here's my idea for ScienceOnLine

"Open Science Bibliography - where can I find Open Access papers on ... ?"

Open access and Open Data are severely limited because no-one knows where to
find the objects. The proposal is to create a bibliography of Open resources
based primarily on academic publications. This can be completely mechanised
for the major publishers and is completely legal.

Pubcrawler software (or similar) crawls all the journal TOCS. It then
downloads the page for each article and examines it to see if it contains
(a) an Open Access marker (these are publisher-specific) or (b) one or more
data sets [*]. If either of these conditions hold a bibliographic entry is
created. In this way we end up with an automated bibliography of either Open
papers or papers with Open resources.

Note that we are not downloading the text or the data sets, simply recording
their existence and providing the link to them.

We have done this for several years for crystallographic data (which seems
to be impicitly agreed to be "data-and-therefore-not-copyrightable") and
have downloaded the data sets. In the present proposal we are not even doing
this.

It may be more appropriate simply to do the Open Access first

The attraction of this is that the results can go straight into CKAN
(metadata about open access) and Open Bibliography. Obviously full open
access publishers (BMC, PLoS) are straightforward. Hybrid journals (e.g.
Springer, Wiley, Elsevier, ACS) are the most immediate gain. This will
locate and publicize the Open Access papers, even when hidden in traditional
closed journals.

Even if we don't do this for SOL I'd like to think this was worth
considering

As a (sometime) researcher outside of a HE institution this would be
*incredibly* useful... consider extending to the social sciences - this
could be of immense gain to research/policy people within public and
voluntary sectors and would help to inform more effective practice in a wide
range of areas.  I have some potential players I could bring in for this.

I think this is an excellent idea.  I will be at Science Online and
glad to help (although I might be too jetlagged).

That's great. I am continuing to copy open-science as that is where JennyM
will pick this up.

If you have potential volunteers that would be great - we could do this on a
per journal (or per publisher) basis where the volunteers created the
templates to read each journal and pick out this material. That's also a
great way of getting experts involved.

JennyM - is this OK to go with ? Can wecraft something from what has been
written?

Hi All

Suggestion now added to solo2011 wiki
http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/
I've emailed one of the organisers to let them know. There are still a
couple of TBD breakout session slots so we'll see what happens!

Open Research Reports session proposed by David Shotton and Tanya Gray is
definitely happening in breakout session no. 3.

It would be interesting to me to also set up a pilot virtual archive of the
harvested open data records in our DataVerse network system. Which would
expose those resources to different communities. If this is all at CKAN I'd
need to be able to wrap the CKAN API in an OAI-PMH proxy.. Not sure how
trivial this is. And feeding the other way -- a number of virtual archives
are expose via OAI-PMH with CC'licenses, the licensing information is on a
LOCKSS manifest page -- so it the license, OAI set etc can be
programatically determined. Any interest in this as a data source?

A CKAN -> OAI-PMH proxy would be pretty trivial (we already have
mapping to dcat + dublin core style RDF).

There is a decent OAI-PMH library for python that I have a very basic
CKAN importer for (from last year and broken, would need to go into
harvester architecture). I believe this also contains a
backend-pluggable WSGI server app.

News release
19 July 2011

Open data challenge: what treasures can you find?

Libraries, museums and archives have recently taken to experimenting
with open data with a vengeance and now the JISC Discovery programme
http://discovery.ac.uk/ with the DevCSI project
http://devcsi.ukoln.ac.uk/blog/about/ are running an international
competition to see what people can unearth in this data.

The challenge is to develop an application which allows people to
discover the treasures hidden in one of ten datasets - from the
shipwrecks lurking off UK shores, to the metadata behind Jane Austen?s
will online.

The rich data sets on offer are:

library data from the British Library, Cambridge and Lincoln
archives data from the National Archives and the Archives hub
English Heritage places data
circulation data from UK university libraries
museum data from the Tyne and Wear Museums collections
search data from the OpenURL router service
the musicnet codex

Andy MacGregor, JISC programme manager, said: "Libraries, museums and
archives are opening up their data because they recognise the
potential to harvest it in interesting new ways to make their
collections more useful for education and research. Whether this is
through striking visualisations, ways of exploring their content or
valuable juxtapositions with other, similar collections, this
competition is an opportunity to see what exciting possibilities
clever developers can dream up for this rich pot of information."

The judges are interested in browser-based applications that genuinely
make the collections from these libraries and museums even more useful
for people.

There?s a tablet computer ? an EEE Pad Transformer - for the overall
winner but also twelve other prizes to be won.

The competition closes on 1 August 2011.

Read the rules of the competition on the Discovery site -
http://discovery.ac.uk/developers/competition/

Be inspired by Alex Parker from the University of Southampton, who won
a previous JISC competition by bringing to life library data with his
Book Galaxy - blue dots are titles and yellow dots are courses
http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/ajp3g08/mosaicbookgalaxy/

Why not have a go and see what you can do?

Hello Zile,

sorry that an answer took so long. It is great that you want to become
an active member of the open bibliographic data community. There are
several ways to get more involved, of course it depends on your
interests. I will name some, perhaps some others on the list have more
ideas.

- Promote open data in your own institution and country, publish &
share open data and talk about your experiences and use cases for
opening up data.
- Promote Open Bibliographic Data on your blog, on twitter etc.
- Contribute another translation of the Principles on Open
Bibliographic Data[1] (if you are a fluent of a non-English language
which isn't German or Italian)
- Of course you can endorse the principles if you haven't already done so.
- Kindly ask publishers of bibliographic data about the openness
status of their data using isitopendata.org.[2]
- Create an open bibliographic data logo or t-shirt.
- ...

I suggest you best join the monthly virtual meeting to learn more and
to get to know some people active in this working group. It is held
every first tuesday of a month (next August, 2nd) via skype and
etherpad, currently at 15:00 GMT / 16:00 UK Time / 17:00 CET / 11:00
EST / 08:00 PDT...

All the best
Adrian

Greetings also from me.

We have also developed a lightweight technology - BibJSON for Open
Bibliography and there are lots of opportunities for working with this.

Subject: [open-bibliography] HathiTrust and "Open"
Message-ID: <20110731081403.1359617xkgmvf8sb@kcoyle.net>

Here's HathiTrust's definition of "Open Access"

"Open Access: This work is protected by copyright law. It is made  
available from HathiTrust with explicit permission of the copyright  
holder. Permission must be requested from the rights holder for any  
subsequent use."

They also have categories for "Public Domain", "in copyright" and the  
full suite of CC licenses.

I think this "open access" definition is rather discouraging and not  
very helpful. It says that you must request permission for subsequent  
use, but it doesn't say what the pre-subsequent use consists of.

I am finding that this is a fairly common use of "open access" in  
academe - that it means that you can access a copyrighted work --  
which is a stipulation that isn't required for hardcopy items, which  
are "open access" by definition of their physical presence.

*sigh*

I have come across "Open" and "public domain" meaning that a human has  paid
a licence to see something and may not communicate it to other humans
wthout permission (which is unlikely to be given). That's why GRATIS and
LIBRE are essential terms and we should insist on them.

It took 10 years to get them used (rather that a confusing range of
colours). We have to be boringly persistent - I think our best chance is to
get "Open Bibliography" stickers posted in collections and publishers'
offerings.

BTW for various reasons we need to advertise the Principles of OBD. They are
not yet viral and we must make them so.I have been in the US and have sown
at least ones seed but we need more.
