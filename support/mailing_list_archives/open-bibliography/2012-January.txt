Adrian,
Hope to make it - have network/machine problems.

Just to let you know how much your effort is appreciated. Continuous
momentum at this stage is so important.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Articles and reviews
Message-ID: <4F0375A9.6090504@aronsson.se>

I'm digitizing books and sometimes journals, which sometimes contain
book reviews. What kind of mark-up is there to indicate that this
text here is a review of book B by author A, written by reviewer R?
Is there any place where one can search for reviews of book B?
Or reviews of books by A? Or reviews by R?

As an example, here is a review of Macneill Weir: "The tragedy of
Ramsay MacDonald", http://runeberg.org/tiden/1939/0129.html

Should I just digitize the full text and be happy without mark-up?
Is it meaningful to dig deeper into this? Is anybody doing that?
As far as I know, neither Wikisource, Project Gutenberg, the Internet
Archive, nor OpenLibrary are trying to do it.

I could look up each book in OpenLibrary and add a user comment
that a review of the book exists. Is that the best I can do?

Good question. We need such markup for use in BibJSON.

Yes. JSTOR is one such place for academic works.

You might look at how this appears in the JSTOR XML export. 
I would also very much like to learn of any general markup standard for reviews.

Subject: [open-bibliography] OCLC's license for FAST
Message-ID: <20120104123606.63621t7ozh7wte0m@kcoyle.net>

Someone I know wrote to OCLC to get a copy of FAST and received this reply:

"Currently, complete dumps of the FAST file are not available under an
ODC-By license.  OCLC does make dumps available on a case-by-case basis
under a research-use license.  To apply, please contact Eric Childress
(childree at oclc.org)."

So, the file is NOT available under ODC-By, which makes me wonder what  
the ODC-By relates to -- individual records? ODC-By says:

"...this license only governs the rights over the Database, and not  
the contents of the Database individually."

" The rights granted cover, for example:

a. Extraction and Re-utilisation of the whole or a Substantial part of  
the Contents;"

If this is added to the OKFN data list, let's make clear that the  
database is not available, only the linked data service and its output  
(is that right?).

Thanks, Karen. Does this self-contradictory behaviour mean OCLC hasn't
understood open data yet?

It would be nice if someone scraped the FAST data and published it as
a whole at thedatahub.org or elsewhere. ODC-BY - as an Open Data
license - clearly allows this.

I just wrote an email to the FAST contact persons at OCLC inviting
them to write a clarifying guest post about this on openbiblio.net.

All the best
Adrian

Somebody harvest it and republish please. The ODC-By license allows for

  If somebody write a harvesting program, I will be happy to maintain
  it on the OKFN sponsored server for 3lib. In fact, the harverster could
  run there and store it there. 

  Just let me know, I will open an account on the server for you.

So, they say Contents ("data" part of database) are available... however we
cannot give you the structure ("base" part of Database).

Karen, I honestly STILL do not see the value in OCLC Fast.

http://experimental.worldcat.org/fast/556581/  Why is the data here, more
valuable then these 2:

http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/n81050796.html

http://www.freebase.com/edit/topic/en/tallinn_university_of_technology

??

Please explain, I am interested to know more.

Thad,

The advantage of FAST is that it is (more or less) LCSH taken apart.  
So instead of:

Police -- Italy -- Rome -- Fiction

you have:

Police
Italy -- Rome  [and I'd rather see this separated or handled with a  
relationship]
Fiction

The FAST headings look more like tags, and you are more likely to be  
able to connect "Police" alone to a term in another vocabulary than  
the full heading. Non-librarians are also more likely to want to use  
the FAST headings since the full LCSH headings are gawdawful. So I see  
it as a possible way to connect from library data to non-library data.  
Something like:

tags --> FAST --> LCSH --> library record

That said, LC is working to get most of the individual facets defined  
in LCSH at id.loc.gov. Open Library has already done its own  
break-down of the ugly LCSH headings, but doesn't have the thesaurus  
structure that you can find in id.loc.gov. OCLC's FAST has that  
structure and will be kept up to date.

I'm not sure that FAST is essential. I just think it's better than  
LCSH and may be a friendlier link to the library bibliographic records.

Easy peasy. Script below. Warning: it's not a very polite crawler, or
very intelligent. But it does grab both the RDF and MARC21 version.

I think the decomposed structure is more user-friendly and useful, but
scraping the OCLC site strikes me as an unnecessary level of
indirection.  You're still at the mercy of OCLC's proprietary
processing script and hosting.  If they decide to pull the plug,
you're left out in the cold.

Why not go straight to the source and process the LCSH  in the same or
similar fashion and cut the OCLC out of the loop?  Then you could
publish not only the data, but the script used to derive it.

Here's the link to the FAST converter. It's not quite as simple as  
just breaking apart the headings at the dash-dash points:

http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/fastconverter/default.htm

The advantage of using the OCLC version is that it will be kept up to  
date. I don't know what the converter, run periodically, would result  
in, but perhaps someone can reason that out from the code?

Thanks for the link Karen.  Unfortunately, that's a) just a web
interface to the converter, not the converter itself and b) licensed
under OCLC's restrictive license, not an open source license, so it
wouldn't be reusable even if the actual software were there.

I reviewed some of the presentations and papers available and it's
apparent that the algorithms used have evolved over time and that they
would be non-trivial to reproduce, at least as described.  Having said
that, it's not clear that a simpler implementation wouldn't be just as
easy and effective for users to deal with.

For the short term, scraping the publicly available data is the best
stop gap.  Longer term, the Library of Congress should be encouraged
to either get the OCLC to release the current code or to develop an
open source replacement for it.  Anyone talking to the Library of
Congress should be continually reinforcing that it is unacceptable to
use tax dollars to support the OCLC in maintaining their monopolistic
practices.

As I understand it there are about 1.6 million records so with a 10

  But your script stores all files in one directory, so I thought
  there will be at most 100k file to download. 

  Can you send me your public key, I will authorize it for the 
  account and you can fix?

To: Adrian Pohl <adrian.pohl at okfn.org>
Cc: "Bolander,Robert" <bolander at oclc.org>

Dear Adrian,

Thank you for the query with respect to some confusion that surfaced
in recent exchanges on the open-bibliography list about OCLC?s release
of FAST as linked data. ?I was surprised to see a private email
response from OCLC distributed and mis-interpreted on the
open-bibliography list. ?It would have saved some mis-understanding if
the parties involved had simply queried us for clarification if our
response to their original query did not seem to make sense. Indeed,
it should have been particularly simple given that my email address
was embedded in the excerpted text ;)

And thank you for asking for clarification.

The confusion seems to have surfaced in part due to ?the
unavailability on the FAST landing pages of a link to download the
entire dataset. That the linked data release was available under an
Open Data Commons Attribution license led to the expectation that the
full dump would be made available under those same conditions. Not a
surprizing expectation, but in the interest of moving FAST out as
linked data sooner rather than later, we made FAST available as
decomposed linked data in mid-December and planned to address various
further-work-we-want-to-do in the New Year including addressing
suggestions for enhancements, making a dump available, etc.

Earlier this week a request for a download of the full dataset was
received by one of the system engineers in OCLC Research who responded
that complete dumps were at present only made available under a
research-use license and referred the user to me in OCLC Research as I
field external researcher requests. The system engineer actually
responded correctly as that had been OCLC?s policy up until the FAST
linked data release as access to the full database has required that
researchers and other parties request the FAST file through OCLC?s
external research support request process. Full files of FAST have
been made available for many years to a number of parties under this
process and are provided under our standard research-use license. And
it was *this standing approach* to offering FAST dumps that was
referenced in the email correspondence excerpted in Karen Coyle's post
to the open-bibliography list. ?It was what we could offer immediately
to anyone wanting a dump. The intent was not to confuse, but to be of
service.

So to point: Karen Coyle?s email
[http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2012-January/001272.html
] contains a statement, "So, the file is NOT available under ODC-By"
which is simply incorrect (FAST in decomposed form was released by
OCLC under an ODC-BY license; and there really is no ambiguity. The
data is published under a license; one need only read the license to
understand what term & conditions apply.). And there is no
contradiction ? as I?ve explained the excerpt was referencing a
separate and distinct channel for gaining access to FAST.

All said, now that the holiday break is over, OCLC will be making FAST
available as a dump on our web site under the ODC-BY license in the
near future. I?d suggest it might be worth waiting for that rather
than crawling the data through the API. Perhaps in retrospect it would
have been more useful to have simply informed the person corresponding
with us that the dump was ?coming soon,? but we were trying to be
helpful with a what's-available-now solution.

Ultimately, our interest is in furthering library linked data
experimentation. The full FAST dataset may be useful in some other
circumstances, but it doesn?t do as much to advance experimentation in
this area as the linked data service. To update those who are
interested OCLC will be glad to send an email to the listserv when we
have the full dataset available, including the URL.

OCLC appreciates the strong interest in FAST as linked data and is
pleased that its availability will support further work in the library
linked data community.

On a personal note, thank you for the invitation to prepare a blog
entry on openbiblio.net blog. If I may, I would like to consult
colleagues about this kind offer and get back to you.

I wish you a very Happy New Years.

Regards,

Eric

Dear Eric, dear Robert,

the announcement of OCLC releasing the FAST schema as Linked Open Data

was taken up in the open bibliographic data community with much

interest. But today's mail by Karen Coyle to the open bibliography

mailing list[1] was rather irritating. I quote from this mail:

On 4 January 2012 21:36, Karen Coyle <kcoyle at kcoyle.net> wrote:

> Someone I know wrote to OCLC to get a copy of FAST and received this reply:

This obvious looks like self-contradictary behaviour: On the one hand

licensing a dataset under ODC-BY which means one can re-use the whole

database or significant parts of it subject only ot the requirement of

attribution and on the other hand telling people they get the whole

dataset only under a "research-use" license.

I would be very happy if OCLC clarified its position and I invite you

to do this in a guest post on the openbiblio.net blog.

I am looking forward to your answer.

All the best

  On behalf of the organizers, I am pleased to announce the conference
  "The Value of Unique Scholarly Identifiers to Academics,
  Institutions and Countries". The conference is organized by the
  Association of Lithuanian Serials (see http://serials.lt). It will
  take place in Parliament of Lithuania (see http://lrs.lt), in
  Vilnius, Lithuania on February 14th, 2012.

  We think that the topic of researcher identification is relevant not
  only to librarians and publishers but also to researchers of all
  subject areas.  Therefore, the main goal of the conference is to
  explain to the wide academic community how the latest technologies
  have been changing their profile in the scholarly universe and what
  they can expect in the future.

  Well-known speakers will give insight on the future of the scholarly
  universe and the image of academics in it. Read more about the
  conference at http://uniqueids.org.

  If you wish to contact the organizers write to Eleonora Dagiene, Chair
  of Council, Director of VGTU Press, eleonora at serials.lt.

It's great that the dump will come available. I wish they would  
announce that more widely, since various folks have asked about it.

I think this answers our question about listing FAST on the open data  
site (which is what this was all about, after our monthly conference  
call) - we should list it as ODC-BY and explain in a note that access  
to the database is limited to API access at the moment with a full  
database dump coming later.

  I would have thought that making a dump available should not
  take more than 30 minutes. But maybe I should not take the 
  standards of the Open Library Society as a yardstick to measure
  what OCLC are able to do.

Thanks Charles,
 We are currently working on an Open Biblio project (funded by JISC) and
aimed at developing an Open bibliographic infrastructure (BibSoup,
Bibserver and BibJSON)

But we cannot include your bibliography because it is NC

WHY is it NC? It makes it impossible to re-use it - provenance is hard
enough to track let alone rights.

There is no justification for NC. It solves nothing and makes it impossible
for modern re-use. You couldn't use any of this in a conventional book, for
example.

And, more generally, there is no justification for NC in "Open Access". The
assertion that authors want it is unfounded in fact. I am an author and I
have never found an Open Access supporter who has advocated NC. It's a
myth. It has severely restricted the re-use of information from projects
such as GalaxyZoo.

Let's work to get rid of NC

Thanks,
Fully understood
In OpenBiblio2 this morning we are looking at trying to look at tools such
as Google Refine to help clean data. Of course it may be impossible to
clean automatically.

What you should if feel free to apply the permissions as expressed by the author, not by the licence, because only the author's will is enforceable in natural law.  If your libraries disagree, persuade them otherwise instead of browbeating authors and progressive people like Creative Commons.

What you can also do is bring legal cases all they way to Supreme Courts whenever someone (a profit-hungry TA publisher for instance, or a power-hungry government) comes after anyone who acts in fair use.  It is wrong particularly that disabled people and people who basically know better can be denied this scholarly information on a technicality such as NC's imperfection, or worse criminalized, civilly injured by lawsuit, or fired, let go, for using or publishing it etc.  You are making a very risk-averse decision in insisting that everyone license everything perfectly, and it is that decision that is largely responsible for stopping the flow of information.  So why is it unusable, we are all cowering fear before an emperor who has no clothes.

There is nothing impossible about NC being fully exploited for its purpose, in fact it is one of the most natural ways to permit use and totally legal. Even better than CC-NC would be express an author statement of NC = no copyright!! Attribute and don't plagiarise as per normal practise (and it goes on all the time particularly profs taking the ideas of students, in ways profs aren't even being honest about).  It goes without saying and without licensing, it is a code of honour and reputation in the end.

Remember who started GOAL - global open access library as a concept for a global open access search.  We did so years ago and received very little support.  We were working as students and developing country advocates.  Arif Jinha and Moustapha Diack started the GOAL community years ago but it went nowhere. No problem for us in using the acronmy, no copyright, I am happy about it, and just waiting for some common sense from the dinosaur class.  I'm really respectful of my profs actually, and only saying that because it seems to be the tone on the list for getting some attention.  We are delighted that the acronym stuck in your subconscious.

 If you think about it, you'll stop forgetting the forest for the trees and bullying each other on this list.  You'll defend your allies. If you do that, you'll protect the innocent and take a heuristic all the way to copyright deregulation, which is already de facto for most journals who permit self-archiving and in the best interests of all scholarly publications as well as the disabled, students, professors and the poor.

Sincerly my salutution must be creative.

"Inextenguishable eastern and western, northern and southern enlightenment in the global rising spring", some poetry from the humanities on a cog-sci heavy list.  We shall overcome and we shall have all the literature on our desktop, free for all, forever, in our lifetime, mark my words.  In many ways, we already have it with a little bit of fully legal and technical cleverness from the young wizkids who know digital law and the internet.. 

Why not help me start my Open Creative Publishing Platform for creative arts and scholarship?  Why not drop me a friendly note for the effort I'm making as a penniless MA graduate?

take care good friends and allies in OA.

It is now cleaned. :)  I'll await a decision on how you want to handle the
license, or if you can get the author to change it, up to you guys, but
that page of data is cleaned now and available when it's needed.

Message-ID: <20120118155440.GA21847@fwnc7111.wks.gorlaeus.net>

Hi everyone,

I'd like to make my bibliographic library public. In practice,
that is a single BibTeX file... plus some scripts.

I've now put on github for fun:
https://github.com/langner/library

What is the appropriate license for this? Can I just put in CC0?

Thanks,
Karol

For interest how large is it? And is it a list of your publications (a
Publication List) or the objects you/others are interested in using/reading
(a Reading List)? We are working on both of those in the Openbiblio project
right at the moment.

We can create a BibSoup/Bibserver out of it.

It currently happens to have 1111 elements, and consists solely of the
articles and books, etc., that I've read in the last 10 or so years
while doing research (but not all of them). It's entirely personal.

In time I will add a README file on github to describe it.

Go ahead, it's free :)

I assume PDDL is OK, too, because that's what I went with in the end.

Just attached the PDDL license to my BibTeX file in the newest commit:
https://github.com/langner/library/commit/38b6cf00e8809c0776f0a142b50ea244ae9862a0

I also have some scripts that go along with my bibtex file. This is where
it gets confusing for me -- should I apply the same license to those files,
or should they carry the same license as the data itself?

Best,
Karol

Hi Karol

As a FYI, we tried importing it into a test BibServer, and it works just fine.

Thanks,

Excellent.  
As a GitHub newbie I dont see quickly how to get at the data. 
Please can you post the url at which your https://github.com/langner/library/blob/master/library.small.bib
can be derived without the html wrapper?
Then you can upload the collection to BibSoup via  http://bibsoup.net/upload

It is not clear to me whether GitHub provides a suitable line editor for editing BibTeX or similar data. 
I rather suspect not. I had a lot of trouble navigating around the 13K line in my browser.
I think rather we need an editing tool which allows a user to quickly select an item for editing, and then work
on just that item in a simple UI. BibSonomy provides a clunky UI which does this. I have been trying to improve that UI.
It may at present be better to use BibSonomy than GitHub for biblio collection posting, because BibSonomy has a data model which 
respects the structure of BibTeX records, which GitHub does not.  We need the best features of both GitHub and BibSonomy.


> What is the appropriate license for this? Can I just put in CC0?
CC0 seems great to me. Then on ingest to a larger environment like BibSoup each record should have a field attached to it indicating
both its license/provenence. This statement should be provided by the data provider as a line in the metadata of the collection.
Mark, can you please take a look at this issue?


many thanks Karol for posting your bib, looks like a great benchmark dataset for us to work with!

What exactly is the source URL?

Please, all, when you refer to datasets or resulting displays on this list, provide the exact,
actionable url at which the dataset or results can be found.

Hi Jim

The direct link to the raw bibtext data on Github is:
https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib
(Find it by clicking on the 'Raw' button on the top right-hand corner
of the link that Karol sent)

The link to the results of importing to the dataset was on my local
laptop development machine.

regards,

Etienne

It is also wrong when poorer communities are denied access to works
because the licensor refuses to let them recoup the costs of
distributing those works, through selection of an Non-Commercial
licence which requires everyone to subsidise the work.

I am disappointed when someone argues that discriminating against
the poor is "one of the most natural ways" but I have encountered
it before.

We cannot rely on fair use because it varies greatly around the world.

Also, this is not about attribution or plagiarism because there are
fine licences like CC-By which require attribution without prohibiting
commerce.

Great, thanks for pointer!
Then here is the dataset on my Berkeley BibServer

http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/bibs7?https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib

and here it is on the BibSoup BibServer

http://bibsoup.net/pitman/karol_m_langer_s_bibliography

It is a deficiency of the present BibSoup BibServer compared to the legacy BibServer that there 
is no obvious way to query BibSoup to see if it already has a copy of 
https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib
and if not to ingest one. 
e.g. searching BibSoup for the source url returns nothing.
Mark, can you see how to remedy this? 
It may be as simple as putting the source url in the right search field, I just dont see how.

It is a serious problem for any user who wishes to programmatically upload many bibliographies to 
BibSoup that there is no obvious way to retrieve them after programmatic upload without user 
retaining a dictionary to e.g. map 
https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib to karol_m_langer_s_bibliography

I was all set to start systematically loading Google Scholar Profiles like http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cH0pbIwAAAAJ&hl=en into BibSoup, and then realized that I could only do it one by one,
and that I was obliged to keep track of the arbitrary name that BibSoup assigned to the collection.
I  want to call the bib e.g. cH0pbIwAAAAJ as well as assign it a human readable label and description.
And I want to be sure that if a user queries BibSoup with this google id or the google url they 
will find it.
Please add the above to BibSoup feature requests.

many thanks

Brilliant everyone! we have a technology which seems to be deployable in
very short time.

I suspect this is solved by convention-over-configuration. We can recommend
that Bibsoupers use URLs and URIs in specified ways and if they do I
suspect this is soluble. It's the clash between addresses and names. We
probably need a Bibsoup URI Mint

Thanks Jim, we had intermittent connection at the time so could not
push it remotely, and by the time that was solved you had already
uploaded.

Yes.

You can view all the collections at http://bibsoup.net/collections,
and in the search bar there you can put in
"http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/tmp/testbib.bib"
to return any collection that was created from that source. There are
search options on the main search pages where you can select exact
match (equivalent to adding the quotes), but I have not put them on
the collections page search yet. Will add on the next update.

We did originally allow the collection ID to be created from the
source URL if a collection ID were not provided, but this created long
and unwieldy collection IDs so we opted for requiring one is provided.
If you are doing programmatic upload, you must have to define the
collection IDs in advance anyway, so do you not already know what they
are for subsequent queries? If you are meaning the case where you
upload a collection from a particular URL a second time, then you do
not actually have to worry about matching the collection IDs - any
collection that you previously created will be overwritten if it has
the same source URL, and the collection ID will be altered to match
whichever new collection ID you provide (or will be the same if you
use the same collection ID).

As Peter says, I am really glad that overall this is working well for
people, and that we can create these collections rapidly. The work
this week on updating the websites and issue lists is going well, so
we are in a good position to do some final tweaking and put up more
examples.

Previously I wrote:

Sorry, there was a mistake in this url, which reverts to the default Schramm dataset not Karol's. The right
url for her collection  on the legacy Berkeley BibServer is

http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/bibs7?source=https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib

To clarify my general point, it is that the copy of her biblio on bibsoup should be retrievable with  just as
simple a url indicating the source. I dont care about details of the address, I just want to be able to script it from the source url,
and it should be fully supported and documented. I should not have to first learn and keep track of the fact that
bibsoup likes to use karol_m_langer_s_bibliography as the id for this dataset and that it was user pitman who uploaded it and hence that

http://bibsoup.net/pitman/karol_m_langer_s_bibliography

is the appropriate address. I should know in advance that if I push a dataset to bibsoup then it will be retrievable at an address which
is a simple function of its source url. It should also be possible to anonymise the upload. There are at least 20K Google Scholar which could
machine uploaded to bibsoup by script, and it would be easy to write a daemon which checked from time to time for new profiles hidden in Google Scholar
and uploaded them whenever it found them. You dont need personal ownership of datasets for this. These should somehow be communal property.
The same applies to any arguably open bibliographic source. DBLP, OL are other examples. The act of pushing a button to initiate an upload from that source to bibsoup should
not make a user the owner of the dataset.

> > Do you mean find the Bibservers or retrieve their content? 
Hopefully clarified above.

> I fully agree that a Bibserver needs something like .dump()

Yes, that too, but it will take a while to run. Maybe something to run daily and post the result somewhere that can handle big files.
It does not seem reasonable or necessary to expect typical bibserver installations to support frequent requests for complete dumps.
Is this something CKAN could handle?

  I would be happy to host dumps on the OKFN sponsored

Mark, 
I tried following your instructions below, but I could not make them work.
To reiterate my point, after uploading a dataset from

https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib

to bibsoup, by whatever means, with whatever name, I should be able to retrieve this dataset from a url
as simple as

http://bibsoup.net?source=https://raw.github.com/langner/library/master/library.small.bib

Whatever your internal ids, I believe this is as simple as tagging  the dataset with its source
url, and retrieving from the database by the value of the source_url tag.  Isnt that so? I think
this is implicit in your instructions.
Can you please advise how to do that, and document exactly how to retrieve a dataset from its source url,
by a machine, and not by a human?

many thanks

--Jim

Another typical personal (reading) bibliography Bibsouplet from my
colleague Mark Williamson copied. ca. 460 papers held in Mendeley - dumped
to BibTeX and converted by MarkMcG in minutes into a Bibserver. (Mark, drop
in to meet Mark tomorrow in UG12).

I believe in Bibserver. We are now in a position where every one can "do
their own thing" and explore what is required for interoperability. It will
be useful to get a large class of users who work in roughly the same field,
who would like to compare bibliographic notes in the Open and are happy to
work with a necessarily imperfect system.

I would plan to do this with UKPMC if we can find a reasonable group of
users. Sounds like the maths or DBLP community may also be attuned to this
sort of thing.

P.

I'd like to do this for various groups in the probability community. I can provide a lot of the data myself.
I can also provide a few $K a year to support a SAS BibServer install for the probability community
which I would be glad to oversee editorially, but I need to pay someone to do the sys admin and some hand holding
for setup and customization of the outer layers.

I can also work on getting a Berkeley math and cs bibserver going.

 "There are only two hard problems in Computer Science:
   cache invalidation and naming things."

   -- Phil Karlton


This is a naming problem!

It's soluble by a mixture of good simple practice and cooperative humans.
It's not trivial. As I said I guess we shall have to have a BibserverMint
for IDs. That almost certainly has to be centrally run.

I don't know the solution. There will be one. I trust Mark's knowledge and
judgment on this

Not quite as simple as one URL, but achievable via a machine,
depending on the language in which you are writing, by the equivalent
of the following:

1) curl -X GET 'http://bibsoup.net/collections/?q=source:"http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/tmp/testbib.bib"&format=json&meta=false'

2) The JSON result will include [0]['id'] and [0]['owner']

3) from which can be inferred http://bibsoup.net/pitman/test_bib


I have added an feature request to the issues to add a /source/<url> routing.

Mark,

This full URL you gave:

http://bibsoup.net/collections/?q=source:"
http://bibserver.berkeley.edu/tmp/testbib.bib"&format=json&meta=false

sucked into Google Refine easily.  And that should give folks plenty of
options to get the data out of Bibserver, edit, & export the data out of
Refine and reuse it however they want. (even templating it for re-use in a
wiki web page!)

Thad this is GREAT!

As an example I am doing  250 records from our dept pub list. It looks a
good candiate for refine (things like authors spelt in 2-3 different ways -
note which are semi-consistent, etc.) My current idea is:
* bibliography in RIS , perhaps translated to CSV
* Refine
* retransform to RIS (or develop a RIS-CSV for Bibserver)
* import into Bibserver
*manual check on remaining problems
* maybe a second refine step
* maybe reconvert to RIS and re-enter into dept
* re-import into bibserver

I am really excited about everything. Our thinking is converging on (at
least)
* individuals and small groups create a communal bibserver
* they clean their local Bibserveras much as they need. (I am not a fan of
gloabl normalization - ORCID will slowly come and solve a few problems but
not all)
* assuming they are Open they publish their Bibserver
* Other groups in the same field (or instituion) publish their Bibservers
* the community then eveolves a strategy for normalizing and
disambiguations if they want. There might, for example, be a community
server of refined names. I'd rather provide my name to the community
correctly than worry about the bureacracy of ORCID (which will only do
academics in employment anyway)

Hi Thad,

thanks a lot for that, I tried working with refine over the last
couple of weeks and have a test instance up and running, but I was not
too sure how to get the data back out easily! So if someone imports a
bunch of records and then tidies them, can you show us how we can
easily export them again as JSON? Or am I thinking about it the wrong
way?

Mark

Use the EXPORT button in top right corner...then for JSON output, just
click on Templating... button which defaults to JSON :)  or roll your own,
such as Creole or WikiText or whatever template you want for records,
probably even RIS ? dunno.

Docs here:  http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/Exporters

And video 2 @ 5:30 shows David actually using the live preview feature of
Templating exporter:  http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/

Ah OK, I had a look at this templating thing but obviously not enough
to understand it. So we can make it create bibjson somehow? Will look
at the links you sent.

Yes, you can code an exporter extension for bibjson and an importer
extension as well if you want (Java skills needed)...
http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/ExtensionPoints#Importers

Just like DERI created extensions for RDF, for CKAN, etc.

Thad, that's great. Are you able to
1) provide a wrapper around Google Refine to make it both import and export BibJSON?
2) provide users with a way to access Google Refine via the web so that it does this?
That would be major progress I think.
We might also approach Google Refine developers and ask them to incorporate the wrapper in their product.

This is a generic issue we have with any desktop product or webservice for biblio data processing.
How to interface the product/service with BibJSON? 
How to approach the product or service provider to persuade them to incorporate the BibJSON interface into their product? 
Answering this will require ongoing effort from BKN staff and volunteers, and this effort needs to be coordinated.

I have made a number of such efforts in the last weeks, specifically developing interfaces for the following data sources:
arXiv, MathSciNet, Google Scholar, Google WWW, Springerlink, DBLP ...
In each case, I have a python module which will query the source and convert the reponse to a BibJSON dataset
suitable for upload to BibSoup. I need help with refactoring, hardening, organizing and publishing these modules.  
These modules should be incorporated into a simple python client which will allow anyone with a laptop to query any of these sources and immediately 
upload the results to BibSoup.
Right now I have such a python client running on a Berkeley Server which I can access with a bookmarklet from my browser.
I'd like to see this python client communally maintained with frequent updates  to deal with changing datasource schemas and allow various enhancements.
Volunteers to assist with this development effort?

Mark, many thanks for advice re accessing datasets by source_url.
The curl request you gave did not work on my machine, but I was able to interpret it in python.
See appended python code.
Where to put such code fragments along with documentation of machine access to BibSoup?

Possibly this should be directed to the dev list and not the general open-bibliography list. But I would
still like to invite volunteers from the larger list to contribute to both social and technical aspects  of interfacing
various datasources with BibJSON/BibServer. Hopefully this effort will become better coordinated soon. 
A list of volunteers and what they can potentially contribute to this effort will be a good start towards that.

Many thanks

--Jim

I don't have enough of the Java skills to provide #1, but Tom Morris does
if you recall our Skype conf. call, and you just need to throw a bit of
money at him to have him code this in. He's already done the
Importer/Exporter for Google Spreadsheets :)

Jim, I still firmly believe that your scraping modules should be moved over
to ScraperWiki.com and maintained there.  Create yourself a ScraperWiki
user and learn the basics, which is just 1 step above what your doing now.
 I know you have asked me to do this for you, but honestly, your in a much
better position to just quickly do that yourself over period of 1 Saturday.
:)  After which, the whole community can help maintain those scrapers,
including myself, Mark, anyone.

This is really valuable. It not only makes the material available to more
people but also builds a sense of community.

(Karol is also involved in making his own bibliography available as an
early dataset for BibSoup/BibServer).

Importers and exporters for Bibtex, RIS, BibJSON are all
straightforward and my offer to do the work remains on the table.
Thad and I had a conference call with Mark and Peter to discuss this,
but I'm not wedded to the idea of it having to be an
OKFN/open-bibliography project.  If anyone else has a need for, for
instance, a Bibtex importer, I've already done the legwork to vet
candidate code bases and scope out the work.

I think my proposed cleanup workflow would be different than Peter's
but I'll start a separate thread about collaboration and bibliographic
data.

Actually, as Thad demonstrated, BibJSON can be imported out of the box
and outputing it again is probably just a matter of creating the right
template to pour the data into when using the Google Refine's
templating exporter.

Subject: [open-bibliography] BibSoup
Message-ID: <CAD2k14PS4LcZ_hgO2M8GfHoXSpNBrATN-socA_HZFjaU9RTqyQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have written two blog posts on BibSoup:
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/22/bibsoup-a-new-open-approach-to-managing-personal-and-group-bibliographies/-
includes videos of the team and an animal explanation of BibSoup
http://blogs.ch.cam.ac.uk/pmr/2012/01/23/bibsoup-it%E2%80%99s-here-how-to-create-and-populate-your-own-bibserver/-
a howto for Bibserver

I am really excited about BibSoup (http://bibsoup.net - the team have done
a brilliant job). We have a new concept here - I have tried to explain that
in the first post. It differs from everything else in that it is
deliberately decentralised - anyone can do anything. We do not have the
idea of the one true central bibliography, carefully curated to remove all
warts and blemishes. This is an illusion.

Instead we have local bibliographies. They can be local to:

   - a person
   - a group (this is a real opportunity for us)
   - a department (again a real opportunity)
   - a report (e.g. 7000 citations in IPCC report)
   - a slice across the bibliosphere - an Open journal (e.g. Acta Cryst E),
   a publisher (BioMedCentral or PLoSOne), an abstracter/indexer
   (UK/PubmedCentral), etc. Perhaps filtered by Open rights.
   - current awareness - daily filtering of certian journals or other
   outputs.

I take the view that there will be several providers of large
bibliographies:

   - Open: PubmedCentral, DBLP, RePEC, Arxiv, BNB, many libraries, etc.
   - Free: Mendeley, GoogleScholar, Microsoft Academic Search, Open Library

If Bibserver has API calls to these, then users can link to other opinions
on a given entry. And that's what they are - opinions. There is no absolute
truth. But that helps users clean up their own collections or index their
materials.

We then have the really exciting prospect of thousands, or more, local
collections. The linkage between those will be very interesting - a real
opportunity for bibliographic scholarship. We also have the ability to
extend the Bibserver facets to things like:

   - rights - is it open?
   - links to non-conventional objects. Software, datasets, etc.
   - annotations
   - extraction of material from the resource (text and data mining - where
   allowed)

The real point is that BibSoup is OURS. It's not a walled garden where we
can get "most but not all". Where it might disappear tomorrow. Where we
aren't allowed to build our own index.

I have more ideas than there are current developers. But that's not a
problem. It's Open. All we have to do is get more people to volunteer.

So a real thank-you to the team who have been quietly building this - you
have done a great job.

Hello,

good news from Germany. The German National Library

1) changed its licensing regime for Linked Data to CC0 which makes the
data open according to the open definition[1],
2) has begun to publish the German national bibliography as Linked Open Data.

For more information see the blog post at

If we can offer Bibservers of national bibliographies it will be a great
resource for everyone working in Arts and Humanities, GLAM, etc. and
science monographs.

Bibserver can, in principle, allow annotations. All bibliographies offer
great scope for this.

Definitely. 
Naomi, please can you track these national biblio releases
 as  they appear, establish the appropriate technial and administrative contacts, and coordinate approaches to these contacts to install national BibServers?

This is a particular class of BibServer application, which will have some special characteristics we will need to acknowledge and customize for to some extent.
Hopefully we can learn sequentially how to do this efficiently, and gain
both admin and technical support for national bibservers from the host organizations.

True. More simply, BibServer should allow any Biblio maintainer to 
support  selection of sub collections by interested users. This should be the
first step I think. Maintenance of the user base and permissions will be the 
main burden on the BibServer maintainer. It is not clear to me whether national bib maintainers would be able to support this burden. I rather doubt it, unless there is a technical FTE designated to deal with such things. 

I think that smaller, subject-specific biblios, like for malaria, or 
probability, would be more easily capable of managing users, due to the much smaller scale. But then these installations have to be able to handle ingest of data from  multiple sources including e.g. national biblios.

I don't think this is necessary. Let's say that OKF (say) clone the British
National Bibliography today and put it on a Bibserver. It's
read-everywhere/everybody. It's (let's say) writable by registered people.
These people migh add everything from location of real books, to copyright
info (Public Domain Calculator), to pointers to Wikipedia. This is an
OKF-bibserver, not the BL's, and so long as that's clear then it doesn't
harm the BL and may well enhance it.

Clearly we have a versioning task here, because the BL will continue to
output releases. We don't have to feed the info back to the BL. But there
might be other sites which value our annotations (e.g. copyright
calculations) and they clone a subset from OKF. Similarly we might swap
information with Wikpedia.

We start to get an ecosystem of bibliography. The key thing is that we can
navigate it. IDs and versions are critical. But they should be manageable.
So every so often consenting partners in this might do merge and update (cf
Mercurial or Git). Each node in the network has its own community rules.
(Wikipedia allows anyone to play but erases vandalism - OKF might open
write-permission to anyone in a given project, etc.)

I think that smaller, subject-specific biblios, like for malaria, or

It all depends on what people want. The fundamental truths are:
* no bibliography is perfect (or ever can be)
* no bibliography is up-to-date
* no bibliography is comprehensive (or can be)
* different people want different things.

Let's say I want a bibliography of PGWodehouse (I want to make a giant
graph of all relations of all characters). This is a final task. I clone
the PGW subsection of the bibliography and that's all I need. I annotate
each entry with Gussy Fink-Nottle's appearances, and Offy Prosser and the
Empress of Blandings. The BL aren't interested or worried by this. But
maybe a PGW-society might get very interested and clone and distribute this
resource among its members.

Malaria will need updating. As often as we can manage, but not more. That's
harder. But it's still a unidirectional process. Deletions and updates form
a problem. Some will require manual intervention at first.

But it's far better than not having anything at all

I'd strongly recommend tracking them via creating dataset entries in
<http://thedatahub.org/> and adding them to
<http://thedatahub.org/group/bibliographic> (and now that the DataHub
has integrated storage we can also upload copies of the data itself as
needed -- very useful in my experience for backup / caching purposes).

Aside: anyone who wants to be a curator / editor for that group please
just ping Adrian Pohl.

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEzCMA_A-Z8K5hxQSKf6q09ycynXJyPRE4XwHJGD9gySfw@mail.gmail.com>

I was interested in experimenting with BibSoup, but I'm having trouble
with the file upload system.

I tried uploading a collection from my citeulike library:
http://www.citeulike.org/user/rossmounce/tag/morphophylogeny

1000+ articles, which I exported to a .bib file for re-uploading to BibSoup.
This file is 2.2Mb and basically I get an error message every time I
try to upload the file.

Is it just me and my (home) internet connection? Any ideas?

Regards,

Ross

I doubt it is the size.

nginx/0.7.65

I might make a much smaller bibtext - binary chop.

I've cut it down to 20% and it loads fine.

So I will keep trying to increase the size.

Problems like this are tedious. They can be that the size is too large OR
that there are rogue records of some sort. This sort of debugging is
absolutely standard at this stage of a project - we don't have a validator
so we have to keep trying and interpreting the phenomology of the errors

I have chopped it into 3 bits and all three load OK so it doesn't seem like
a rogure record. It therefore appears that there is, in fact, a limit. This
seems to be somewhere between 447 and 594 records (9049-12373 lines).

I can't do more - should file a bug

Sorry Ross, and thanks for testing it Peter,

I forgot to increase the max upload size on the new server. However, I
have done so now and it works fine:

http://bibsoup.net/test/morphophylogeny

However now that it has  uploaded, the links to view individual
records are failing. This is due to an error in the way that provided
IDs are being used to create the file links, after I changed the
record path at the end of last week. We are currently fixing that.

Thanks very much for trying it out,


Mark

Great. I think we shall go through a period of testing where we identify
rare errors. I have done a good deal of this in other areas and we can be
certain that there are more buglets out there.

I am really excited at what the team has done on upload and display!! I
have uploaded our Centre publications list to
http://bibsoup.net/petermr/ucctest2. DONT take this seriously as it has
many errors (misspellings, omitted fields, etc.). The point we wanted to
test was the group leaders which I have added as an arbitrary key G9. If
this is selected as a facet it can be viewed as bubbles. This was one of
the things that some people here were keen to see.

If I want to request features is there a facility on the issue tracker? And
is this welcomed?

Good to see.
Its a bit disappointing that this dataset contains no links to text or even abstracts.
This was facilitated in the legacy bibserver by scripted links to Google Scholar, e.g.
this simple title link

http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=++Ligand-Target+Prediction+using+Winnow+and+Naive+Bayesian+Algorithms+and+the+Implications+of+Overall+Performance+Statistics

gets the user to an abstract of the first item

Nigsch, F and A Bender and Jenkins, JL and Mitchell, JBO (2008)
Ligand-Target Prediction using Winnow and Naive Bayesian Algorithms and the Implications of Overall Performance Statistics
vol. 48, 2313-2325

As a feature request, I suggest a simple display option in any BibServer display to show scripted links to Google Scholar or other desired service e.g.
Microsoft Academic or MathSciNet.

Automated provision of such links, and better still, making it easy for users (or machines) to follow these links and harvest 
metadata  including e.g. abstracts from the sites they point to, would add great value to typical BibServer displays.

This task could be facilitated by a BKN Linkserver, i.e. a BKN node dedicated to matching and enhancing biblio data uploaded anywhere to BibSoup.
This is a basic repetetive task, given a single bibitem, of whatever standard, to enhance it as best as possible by machine matching
with various sources, and thence create a multiply linked hybrid record  of superior quality.  I've been working towards this with experiments in Berkeley.
Would be glad to have assistance on this. Experience with federated searching or multithreading should be helpful to build a prototype. I think the main 
issue is handling varied responses from multiple sources and offering them to user is a way that is readily mashed up to provide the composite record.

Thanks for all the help.

Looks very interesting. I'll be sure to keep tabs on the progress of
this project.

This dataset is what the Centre compiles as a record of what the Centre has
published. It is simply an aggregation of material collected by the Centre
or sent in by staff like me. It was never designed to be put on the web.
There are many problems - duplications, missing journals, etc.

I suspect it's very typical of many academic departments. The point is
rather that Bibserver can enhance it. The faceted browsing is very powerful.

Indeed. If it's easyfor Bibserver to include APIs then this should be a
feature request. It's up to the team to prioritize.

I received this from BiomedCentral.

Dear Dr Murray-Rust,

We thought you might be interested to know how many people have read your
article:

Open Bibliography for Science, Technology, and Medicine
Richard Jones, Mark MacGillivray, Peter Murray-Rust, Jim Pitman, Peter
Sefton, Ben O'Steen and William Waites
Journal of Cheminformatics, 3:47   (14 Oct 2011)
http://www.jcheminf.com/content/3/1/47

Total accesses to this article since publication: 1701

This figure includes accesses to the full text, abstract and PDF of the
article on the Journal of Cheminformatics website. It does not include
accesses from PubMed Central or other archive sites (see
http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/libraries/archive). The total access
statistics for your article are therefore likely to be significantly higher.

Your article is 'Highly accessed' relative to age. See
http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/about/mostviewed/ for more information
about the 'Highly accessed' designation.

I think this can be seen as a combined product of the perceived value of
the article and its publication as Open Access (CC-BY). Openness increases
the value of multiple metrics. In general where we can add access
statistics to a resource of any kind then they are valuable. And it's a
nice bit of positive feedback to the OKF in general.

P.

You can submit an issue to the github repo. feature requests will be
tagged "feature request" and considered in future sprints. Issues
themselves should be short and to the point, but could link out to a
demo or blog post of similar / described functionality, to aid in
fitting requests into sprint timetables.
