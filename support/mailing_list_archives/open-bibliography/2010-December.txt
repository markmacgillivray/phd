Is anyone going to code4lib 2011 (http://code4lib.org/) in Bloomington Illinois.

I won't be going to code4lib 2011 and I wondered if anyone from this
list would be interested in giving a lightning talk there about the
working group and recent open data developments -- I imagine it would
be of interest to participants.

Hello,

it's the month's first tuesday and so today the Openbiblio virtual
meeting is scheduled at 16:00 GMT. Unfortunately I can't attend due to
private obligations. Anyway, I created an Etherpad for the meeting:

http://okfnpad.org/6th-open-bibliography-meeting

I proposed one agenda point on the etherpad: Commenting and correcting
the principles on open bibliographic data draft.
Peter, Mark and I did some more work on the principles and would
bevery happy to get some comments by other people.
Please add further agenda points as needed.

Hope you'll have a fruitful meeting.

Cheers
Adrian

I'm confused by the Etherpad note that the meeting has taken place --  
I thought it would be in an hour from now, but maybe I have my time  
zones mixed up. GMT is 8 hours from Pacific, right?

Anyway, I have LOTS of comments on the draft, some of which I will  
summarize here.

First, there are wording changes that I would normally like to make.  
However, because there is the UK/US language difference, if a native  
UK speaker has already gone over this, then we should discuss before I  
suggest those changes.

Other comments:

1. Do not use "free", which is ambiguous. Use "without cost" or  
"without restriction" as appropriate.

2. Do not use "record" -- the citations created by authors are not  
records. Can we find another term, such as "bibliographic  
description", "bibliographic data"?

3. "addressing" does not work for me... I want to use something based  
on the term "location"

4. I don't think the list of data elements in the first second is  
helpful, and I don't think it necessarily serves both functions  
(identification and location). Perhaps for actual identification of a  
publication we can refer to library catalog entries and citation rules  
like MLA without needing a list of data elements. For the location  
function (assuming this means actually getting your hands or eyes on  
the item) you need a library catalog entry or a URL (for online  
documents).

5. I'm not sure why the heading in this first section is  
"Bibliographic data already in the public domain", unless the  
intention is "Why we maintain that bibliographic data is not covered  
by copyright." The wording does not say that to me.

6. the section on URIs seems to be aimed at online resources, not  
bibliographic data in the web environment. We have bib data in the web  
environment that does not have URIs or URLs.

7. I would not assert that user-generated tags are public domain. We  
can't make that decision for all users who contribute tags. I agree  
that it is a good idea to get users to agree that use of their tags is  
unrestricted, but the circumstances in which users tag things varies  
greatly, so this broad statement is problematic.

7a. Rather than asserting that things are public domain, I would  
rather assert that these things are not covered by intellectual  
property rights. It's a language quibble, but I feel that "public  
domain" is a legal term and not a description. That may just be me.

8. Subject headings and classification notations may be considered  
creative work on the part of the cataloger. I would put them in the  
second category of data elements to which rights may apply.

9. "Sponsorship" -- is this sponsorship of the content or the  
publication? I assume that it refers to the sponsorship of research  
that is often cited.

10. This is more of a general concept, but in my  own mind I am  
unclear on the rights status of name authority data. Selecting one  
fact to represent a display of many similar facts does not seem to  
meet the creativity requirement (that US law requires). But I agree  
that it belongs in this "grey area" category in the document.

11. #3 of the recommendations should refer to ANY restrictions on the  
data, including attribution. Once we start mashing up data, anything  
but pure open use becomes impossible. So perhaps this point should be  
about ANY restrictions, of which non-commercial is one, attribution is  
another, and even share-alike is another. (Note, if W3C provenance  
work becomes a reality, we could say that people should pass on  
provenance data that is received. This wouldn't so much be for the  
rights issue, in my mind, but so that people can make selections based  
on whose data they trust most. One issue with provenance is that is  
could give people a way to attempt to control their data, and we will  
probably need to address that if it becomes a reality.)

I hope this all doesn't sound harsh -- I didn't take the time to  
soften my language :-) in my haste to get this down. I can make the  
purely editorial corrections on the Google doc if you would like. The  
other bits we may need to discuss. Another option would be that I make  
changes -- perhaps in another copy of the document? (I can't remember  
off-hand if Google docs has a "revert" function) And then we can  
discuss that version.

The "Note: The meeting didn't take place, only Jim Pitman and Adrian Pohl had a phone talk."
refers to what happened last month.

Subject: [open-bibliography] URNs for National Bib Numbers
Message-ID: <1291840126.3833.45.camel@monster>

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3188

Ross Singer just put this onto twitter a second ago and I think that
this might be an acceptable way to generate URNs for the bibliographic
data, specifically for the BNB data in my mind.

Eg as far as my understanding of the rfc goes,
http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GBA267005 would have a URN of:

urn:nbn:gb-uk2001008809279

(using British Library id, originally "(Uk)008809279" and published year
of 2001)

URNs don't resolve so how we incorporate them or even if we incorporate
them is up for discussion :)

Including a triple of <http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GBA267005>
<owl:sameAs> <urn:nbn:gb-uk2001008809279> might be a way perhaps,
replacing my ahem magicked open vocab term of 'blid' for the British
Library ID.

As to the end use, I'm not sure but this seems like it might sensible
and would trade one triple for another.

The con side to this is that it pushes a lot of meaning into the URI
format, the structure of which tells you about the source, year, and so
on without typing the property as being a british library id.

Any Ideas?

Ben

Year isn't necessary, the German guidance below doesn't use it:

And 
http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GBA267005

Right, the original RFC for NBNs is a little vague on a couple of
counts.  My interpretation of the section around that F-code is that
it's specific to the National Library of Finland and maybe its
inclusion in the RFC is to give implementers some guidance if they
have no persistent identifier scheme?  I don't really know (and
reading RFCs is akin to pouring acid in my eyes on an enjoyment
scale).

The RFC also gives the following URN template:

urn:nbn:{ISO 3166 code}-{NBN string}
or
urn:nbn:{ISO 3166 code}:{sub-namespace code}-{NBN string}

So, like Ben pointed out, I think the format for the bnb would be
something like:

urn:nbn:gb:bnb-GBA267005

although following the model that the Germans seem to use, it would
look more like:

urn:nbn:gb:bnb:GBA267005

but it's hard to tell.  Neither the National Library of Sweden nor the
National Library of Hungary appear to include their nbns in their
catalogs (so, by default, they aren't appearing in either library's
RDF).

I definitely agree with you, re: the downside of using URNs.  I wonder
if it would be worthwhile to set up a purl like:

http://purl.org/NET/nbn/gb/bnb/{id}

where "gb" could route to some nationally appropriate resolver?

Not sure.

In either case, as far as a service like Bibliographica is concerned I
would propose to take a strategy like we already do with authors and
series and suchlike, and continue to have the data in the store as it
is now, but also put

   <http://bnb.bibliographica.org/entry/GBA267005>
       owl:sameAs <urn:nbn:gb:bnb:GBA267005>.

That way statements that we have about this subject can be immediately
found through dereferencing, but we still have something IFP-like that
can be used to join across different datasets with information about
the same thing. Likewise for the BL if they put up
e.g. http://bl.uk/bnb/GBA267005. 

I favour the German approach FWIW, it looks more pleasant to my eyes,
but it's not a strong preference.

] http://purl.org/NET/nbn/gb/bnb/{id}

] where "gb" could route to some nationally appropriate resolver?

I'm down on purl.org these days because they are being very
conservative about implementing CORS. But definitely something along
these lines could be quite useful.

Well, actually, what I had in mind when I wrote my initial post was the other circumstance mentioned by the rfc, which is "when a national library may also assign a trusted organisation(s) its own sub-namespace" and how we assign BNB numbers amongst all the legal deposit libraries (including NLS and NLW), etc. etc.

In any case, I was thinking too narrowly. I don't know if NLS and NLW assign their own NBNs (I will try and find out) but in any case they could potentially do so, so I think we need to split the national namespace just in case.

What I'd like to know though is if the format Open Bibliography is choosing for the (BL) bnb will constrain the BL in the future if/when we decide to implement our NBNs as URNs. This is something we've been discussing.

What is the benefit for Open Bibliography? You've already created an identifier for the resource based on the BNB.

Thanks

I agree - they certainly publish their own bibliographies (at least

Well, certainly it could force your hand a bit, depending on the

that a de facto form could arise, if prevalent enough.

I think we're at the point where compiling all of the identifiers we
have about resources is a necessary step for disambiguation and these
identifiers are going to have to be formatted in unambiguous ways.

> What is the benefit for Open Bibliography? You've already created an identifier for the resource based on the BNB.

This is true, but it's non-standard.  So we (in this case, "we"
meaning "Talis") start using the Open Bibliography BNB URIs as the
identifiers for the BNB in Aspire or Prism (for example): is the BL
comfortable this (Open Bibliography) being the de facto identifier
assignment agency for the BNB?  If the Library of Congress were to
publish their catalog as linked data, how should they represent BNB
numbers?  What about the Open Library?  As linked library data gains
momentum, I think we're going to have to have identifiers like these
in place for people to correctly identify the resources in their
collections.

And, again, while URNs are less than ideal from a linked data
perspective, they are good for providing a consistent and unique
identifier, which is exactly what we need.

BNB data has been provided in an open structure to enable
experimentation. 

The British Library is investigating various platform options for
hosting the BNB and other datasets as Linked Open Data. Future releases
of the BNB will include persistent identifiers based on the BNB number
and we are concerned that the premature assignment of URNs may prejudice
this activity.

Apologies if my reply came across as antagonistic to BL's planning
process (it wasn't intended to be), my point was merely that the
longer there is an absence of an official policy here, the greater the
odds of a alternative solution muddying the waters.  If that
alternative gains enough momentum, I think your concerns are extremely
justified.

Hello Karen,

thanks for your valuable input. I'm commenting inline. Here is a link
to the discussed document: http://bit.ly/gIfB11

Definitely someone should align the wording as soon as we have agreed
on the content.

There is only one instance of "free", in the "preamble" bit.
Personally, I don't mind using "free" there. "Without restriction"
would be wrong (because we say attribution and share-alike are ok too)
but please change it if you've got a good better wording.

I changed it to "bibliographic description".

We have to make clear what we are talking about. I don't exactly know
what Peter actually had in mind when he proposed this definition of a
bibliographic record/description. I always thought he meant locating a
resource in the context of a journal, an edited volume etc. On the
other side locating may mean locating in a collection, indicating a
place on the shelf. Maybe you think - as well as I do - about holdings
information and call number that adress a specific book. We certainly
should make this clear in the text.

Refering to catalog entries and citation rules sounds good. It also
would shorten the text quite a bit. Would you change that bit?
Regarding the location function we must first make clear what we mean
by that (see above). I think Peter had something other in mind when he
proposed this.

The wording isn't clear but I couldn't think of anything better. It
should indicate that the ?section covers those parts of bibliographic
descriptions which are not copyrightable and thus from the point of
their creation in the public domain. Any ideas for a better wording?
Then please change it.

...on the other side we can identify print resources with URIs. I
think the text in this part is ok because of being vague enough ("can
be achieved" and now "is possible").

In the first draft tags and subject headings were in the group of
legally uncertain data as you suggest. I don't know why the act of
tagging and indexing should be creative enough to gain copyright over
taggings... But to be safe we might (again) put it into the next
section.

Hmm, I don't see this problem. We could contribute to making "public
domain" a common term. I think it is already used quite often.

See above.

You are right.

I agree that name authority data might as well be public domain.

I don't agree with this. The recommendations built on each other and
it's #4 which says what you propose for #3. So you basically are
proposing deleting #3 and - if we do so - we could also delete #1 and
#2 because anybody who complies to #4 also complies to the three
principles before that.

Everybody's free to add comments to the document and change the
content. Actually, google docs does versionizing.

It may be helpful to visualize my motivation as from a scientist who until
recently had no interaction with mainstream library practice. The motivation
springs from the fact that secondary publishers use metadata to control our
actions and also charge us money for it. We live in occupied territory.

In science the action location or condition of an artifact is irrelevant
unlike monographs and incunabula. The article is platonic and there is a
platonic abstraction of the route to find and identify it - that's what I
mean by scientific bibliography. "Current contents" (does it still exist?)
is bibliography which should be ours by right.

I think I mean something different by "location" - I mean the ability to
find any copy of the platonic article whereas for a physical book this is
different for each exemplar. That is valuable for a particularly library and
I'm happy for it to be considered but it's not part of my struggle. (BTW I
am supportive of all aspects of bibliography - I'm just keener on one part!)

that.

This is not quibbling. Failure to free bibliography costs academia hundreds
of millions of dollars a year

I am agnostic about individual catalogues so long as they are controlled by
the creators and not third parties monopolising and constricting us. The
Libray of XYZ university should hold the rights to its own catalogue of
physical holdings. The rights to bibliography of electronic artifacts should
belong to the commons

If a third party wishes to take Open (libre) bibliography and tag it and
posses the result, fine. What we have to avoid is the use of tagging to
restrict us from our common right

PD doesn't apply to - say - scholarly content because *automatically* that
carries copyright - by law. In contrast we argued that scientific data did
NOT, de facto, carry copyright. However to make this abundantly clear we
need to go through a conscious (but now simple) process of dedicating the
content to the PD - the PDDL. My guess is that this works for bibliography
as well - it is not, de facto, copyright.

Peter, not sure what you are suggesting here: that we use 'gratis' and  
'libre' or 'Open Access'?

I think I'm beginning to understand. To me "locate" isn't limited to  
physical items -- essentially Google "locates" things for you with its  
search. The OpenURL concept (used heavily for academic articles) is  
that of locating the most appropriate copy -- it recognizes that there  
is often more than one "instance" of a scientific article; some  
instances may be physical, some may be electronic; some are in the  
library, some are covered by the library's subscription. It is often  
referred to as a "locator service" (which I would feel comfortable  
using for something like Google as well).

Does your term "address" have the sense of providing one or more  
actual links? In other words, would both of these be an address?:

Right. This is also what library functions aim to do.

It wasn't clear to me the purpose of that list. Yes, if you feel that  
particular elements are public domain, it would be good to provide a  
list. For readability, it may be best included in an appendix or  
addendum. I think that lists in the middle of text tend to drive  
readers away. :-)

I think it was the "already" that threw me on this. If you want it to  
be declarative, you could say:

Bibliographic Data is Public Domain Data

If the following paragraphs are an argument for open bib data, you could say:

Well, maybe it should, but the vast majority does not, and we wouldn't  
want that data to be excluded from the discussion. Think about all of  
the citations in articles and digitized books. I wouldn't  
over-emphasize URIs. That's not really about the data but about the  
technical format, and it seems to me that we want bib data, not just

So maybe that is a good point to make: that although someone may add  
to bibliographic information, and those additions may be worthy of  
some kind of IP ownership, it should not be the case that those  
additions change the copyright status of the bib data itself. There is  
an easy analogy in this for books: publishers often take a public  
domain title, add an introduction or some other text, and then  
republish to PD book. They can copyright the introduction or other  
added text, but the original PD work remains in the public domain.  
Publishers slap copyrights on these books, but if you look at the  
small print the (c) only applies to the new part.

We should say that adding to bibliographic description does NOT change  
the public domain status of the factual part of the description; only  
the added parts *may* be covered by copyright. By saying this, a whole  
database (like EBSCO) therefore contains some copyrighted material,  
but they have not gained copyright over the names of authors or titles  
of articles, only over the part that they contributed that is creative  
in nature (well, the creative part is from US law, so we probably  
can't use that term).

I'll go along with this as long as we are very clear about what we  
mean by public domain and why certain aspects of bib data are not  
covered by copyright. Unfortunately, we haven't had a court decision  
to back us up, and so we are kind of whistling in the dark. I think it  
would make sense to say that we are declaring this to be in the public  
domain (which is a kind of challenge) rather than stating that  
"factually" it *is* in the public domain, which is not (yet) true.

I went back and read the earlier statements and it is true that they  
would all have to be removed. So I think it would be worth discussing  
this. AFter all, if we've spent the entire document saying that  
factual bib data is in the public domain, then there shouldn't be any  
need for talk about licenses. I'm now quite confused about the overall  
goals of this document.

Firstly I think the reason to talk about licenses is because some
places do not have a public domain as such, the best you can do is
release something under a license that confers the same rights that
people would have if there were a public domain.

That said, I would like to draw attention to the history of this
discourse in the free software world. Part of the root problem is the
ambiguity in the word free -- most languages have different words for
the concept of free of cost and freedom. In terms of free software it
has come to mean freedom in terms of the Four Freedoms of the Free
Software Definition, the intellectual ancestor of the Panton
Principles.

It has become the practice to refer to software whose license
incorporates a copyleft principle, that insists that derivatives must
also be free, as "free" and software that is otherwise free but
doesn't impose this requirement as "open". Until the legal loophole of
dual licensing was discovered free software was considered hostile to
venture capital investment and open software became popular in those
circles precisely because it was possible to make it proprietary.

The situation was then exascerbated by the Creative Commons promoting
intellectual property with a "chose what restrictions you wish to put
on your work" spectrum of licenses for creative works. Essentially
this popularised the restriction of others' rights where previously
only people with lawyers could do this. You could make analogy with
the state (police, military, etc.) previously being the ones entitled
to carry weapons whereas now the populace has been armed. Not
necessarily very helpful.

Now back to this thread. It is being advocated that bibliographic
information be released as if it were public domain information. The
subtle point being glossed over is that it isn't even clear that the
machinery of intellectual property can apply to this type of data (and
some pretty good arguments that it cannot) so by saying that it should
be public domain or equivalently licensed the point that it is subject
to the intellectual property regime is already being conceded.

*IF* this type of data can be intellectual property, and it should
somehow be considered part of the common stock of humanity, but work
has to be done to make it suitably available and useable, then it is
actually worth making some effort to make sure it stays that
way. Otherwise we will be encouraging people to take the open data and
add their special secret information to make proprietary data. Right
now we are going to significant effort to separate what is open from
what is proprietary. Not using copyleft terms defeats the purpose.

Cheers,

Yes - most scientists don't actually care what instance they receive. In
some subjects the "final" version matters. However the difference between
the authors' final version (e.g. Word) and the publishers' PDF is
often irrelevant - scientists don't really care about pagination within a
journal (they only need the pages to locate and identify the article. In
some cases they prefer the authors' version as it hasn't been trashed into
unprocessable PDF.

let's call that http://www.publisher.org/*journalofx/3/6/746*

There are some subtleties. Both require an address resolver. The first is
relatively useful for machines UNLESS there is something like Google. A
human may be able to solve this by going to a publisher web site and
browsing through (though some publishers websites are so awful it's
unbelievable). On many of them I can't find how to browse the archives.

The second also requires an Address resolver but it's so common you don't
think of it, yet the whole Net is built on it. It's the DNS system which
looks up all registered domain names and translates them into IP addresses.
This allows the browser or user agent to navigate to the publisher site.
Then the publisher server decodes *journalofx/3/6/746*  into the actual
place in the filestore (normally there is a close mapping). If there is a
query, then it's a database search

The universal DOI is also an address resolver. It turns unique strings into
web addresses. This is done by doi.org and publishers pay them a small fee
for each DOI minted. Again there is usually a split between top level and
publisher

The problem is that the document could be a clarifying document (in which
case fine) or it could be a declaration of independence. Unfortuantely I
think it's the latter. So it's


We hold these truths to be
self-evident<https://mail.google.com/wiki/Self-evident>,
that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their
Creator<https://mail.google.com/wiki/Creator_deity>with certain
unalienable
Rights <https://mail.google.com/wiki/Inalienable_rights>, that among these
are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of
Happiness<https://mail.google.com/wiki/Life,_liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_happiness>.



 Here "We" means the founding fathers, not the whole of humantity. They
asserted it as a political fact, not a universally held truth. I think it's
the same with bibliography.

Yes, but this often effectively removes the original from the PD because of
the lack of metadata. Uncertainty always come down on the side of the

Now back to this thread. It is being advocated that bibliographic
information be released as if it were public domain information. The
subtle point being glossed over is that it isn't even clear that the
machinery of intellectual property can apply to this type of data (and
some pretty good arguments that it cannot) so by saying that it should
be public domain or equivalently licensed the point that it is subject
to the intellectual property regime is already being conceded.
This is the key point. The problem is that others have already grabbed this
as their property. They may have no right but we have to have a mechanism
that contests this. In this area logical arguments don't work - the ground
is too shaky and lawyers aren't logicians.


*IF* this type of data can be intellectual property, and it should
somehow be considered part of the common stock of humanity, but work
has to be done to make it suitably available and useable, then it is
actually worth making some effort to make sure it stays that
way.

Agreed - we are debating the mechanism

 Otherwise we will be encouraging people to take the open data and
add their special secret information to make proprietary data.

Possibly true, but probably they need no encouragement. In practice it's
highly unlikely that corporations will look at science data and say = "oh
good, it's now Open so we can start to possess it". They will have been
possessing it anyway. They occupy land that they think they can get away
with, not that can definitively be proved to be non-owned.


 Right now we are going to significant effort to separate what is open from
what is proprietary. Not using copyleft terms defeats the purpose.
I think we are going to have to consult Jordan soon...

OCLC Research and Cambridge University collaborate on Open Metadata project - 28 Feb 2011

Library information provider OCLC Research, US, and Cambridge University have announced that both organisations will jointly conduct a six-month, JISC-funded investigation into the value of making collection metadata openly available in a sustainable manner.

The COMET (Cambridge OPen METadata) project will release a sub-set of bibliographic data from Cambridge University Library catalogues as linked data in multiple formats. This activity will test a number of technologies and methodologies for releasing open bibliographic data including XML, RDF, SPARQL, and JSON.

To enhance linking options, records will be enriched using two OCLC Research services to assign FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology) and VIAF (Virtual International Authority File) headings. This will allow for effective information retrieval and semantic interoperability.

Starting in February 2011, COMET will document the availability of metadata for the library's collections which can be released openly in machine-readable formats and the barriers which prevent other data from being exposed in this way.

It is expected that the project will bring value to the wider community by contributing substantially to the availability of open metadata. Linking to FAST and VIAF headings will demonstrate the potential usefulness of a structured semantic approach to data. The project will also look at the value data enrichment offers for resource discovery.

1. ACCESS
The work shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge.

Mendeley has declined repeated requests to provide a complete database dump.

I also have problems with CC-BY for biblio data, especially when the BY is from a secondary 
indexer, not even the original publisher, and we are talking about public domain metadata 
in the first place.  What is the effect of the BY clause on biblio metadata?  I think almost 
nothing, because of the clause in CC-BY that the status of public  elements is in no way 
affected by the license.  Still, the BY clause has a chilling effect on the kind of 
"frictionless sharing" of biblio data which I think we should be promoting.
(Thanks to Facebook for this notion in another context.) 
In particular, I strongly dislike the display requirements  
http://dev.mendeley.com/docs/display-guidelines/

-- Any content obtained from Mendeley must include proper attribution as such. Mendeley brand elements should be placed within close proximity to the content, so that the users can easily understand the source. For those wishing to brand the content as their own, please contact trademarks at mendeley.com with the subject line "SELF BRANDING."

I do not think this community should encourage or condone this sort of commercialization of
biblio data. I would rather see promotion of ideas of provenance of biblio data, enforced by
open community norms, rather than legal attribution requirements. I would rather see us promote
non-commercial alternatives, and create bibliographic stores unencumbered with BY requirements,
but including provenenance assertions whenever possible.

If I pick up a bib record from Mendeley, and personally check that its data agrees with
whatever other data I may have from other sources, why should I  be legally obliged to 
credit Mendeley as the source. Or even am I obliged at all? If I have some repututation as 
a maintainer of high quality bibliographies, it is probably more important to further users of 
the data that that I have checked it than that I copied it from Mendeley.

I am not offering a solution to the provenance issue for biblio data. 
But I think CC-BY licenses are not the way to solve it.
And that this community should think about what alternative standards might be promoted.

Another embedding I have used extensively is

links = {http://...  anchor 1
	http://...  anchor 2
         .....  },

which contains the same info except for the "rel" and other attributes of the link.
A third option would be 

link_1_html = {... },
link_2_html = {... },

where the ... is a plain html rep of the link e.g. <a href="$url$" rel = "$rel$" title = "$title$" .... >$anchor$</a>
It is a general question for this group to consider:
How best to choose and promote such simple ad hoc extensions of common standards which can be
round-tripped to BibJSON without loss of information? 
Promotion of such extensions could play a big role in adoption/expansion of BibJSON/BibServer.

4. Absence of Technological Restriction

The work must be provided in such a form that there are no technological
obstacles to the performance of the above activities. This can be achieved
by the provision of the work in an open data format, i.e. one whose
specification is publicly and freely available and which places no
restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use.
I am not familiar with the details of what OCLC is releasing but it I would
have thought the provider had a duty to make it possible to access all the
content in some way (dumps and iterators are the two things that come to
mind). Do OCLC give an indication of how to get all the data? Because
simply saying "our data is Open but you can't get it" isn't really Open.

I have some sympathy for data providers as I have had to create a set of
crawlers to download Open Data that I have collected. It's a non-trivial
problem.

want "crowdcrafting" all the people participating in the project will build
this project because it is important to them.

In any case, maybe you will have to involve people in the later stages of
your project for validating some data, so if you want, you could use
PyBossa to do this. If you need more info about the project, let me know it=
.

Cheers,

Daniel

Hi,<br><br>I think that Peter has raised several good points about human va=
lidation and how they should not be treated like &quot;monkeys&quot; workin=
g for the project :-)<br><br>From CCC we love to say that instead of crowds=
ourcing a project what we want &quot;crowdcrafting&quot; all the people par=
ticipating in the project will build this project because it is important t=
o them.<br>

<br>In any case, maybe you will have to involve people in the later stages =
of your project for validating some data, so if you want, you could use PyB=
ossa to do this. If you need more info about the project, let me know it.<b=
r>

<br>Cheers,<br><br>Daniel<br><br><div class=3D"gmail_quote">On Sat, Aug 18,=
