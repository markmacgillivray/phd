Thank you for this Peter! Very interesting. I only wish the Public
Catalogue Foundation would use an open license for (at least some of)
their data. I wrote to them about this several years ago, but there
was no response. Seems to be an especially pertinent issue given that
they are expecting the public to contribute to their data ? and surely
the public should be at least permitted to reuse portions of the data
contributed by the public?

Does anyone have a contact at the PCF?

I would be glad to contribute to such efforts.

Open Library is a significant start for books.
Connotea, CiteUlike, BibSonomy, Mendeley, Zotero, Sciplore, ....  are starts in the journal article space. But sofar these are
competing rather then cooperating with each other, and unlike OL the article collections are not available in bulk with suitable
licenses for aggregations to form.

Finding and gaining widespread adoption of a license suitable for bulk exchange and republishing of article metadata seems
like a precondition for the next big step in the article space. With the right license, smaller publishers should
be glad to release their metadata directly to an open aggregation. As this collection grew, some benefits of crowdsourced
cataloging might emerge.  

Another way to start would be to demonstrate the crowdsourced cataloging on currently open data, 
e.g. what can be gained via OAI-PMH. Possibly BASE  http://base.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/en/index.php could play a role in this.
Which makes me wonder, is the BASE metadata collection available in bulk? If so with what license? I could not see quickly from
the site.

  No.  I have a part of the data in 3lib. That part is updated by
  them. But I have not updated in the recent past because of technical
  issues on my side, for which I apologize. I hope to be getting to
  fix this soon, it is second on my agenda list. I hope to be
  able, as a result of changes to publish an catalog per
  data series of what I have.

Interesting idea from a drunken conversation last night; Given a 
bibliography containing (maybe) metadata, and (maybe) URIs/URLs  you 
could build a tool to do a best effort conversion to Endnote, BibTex or 
"bibo/dc" etc. Using a whole bunch of strategies, from basic looking at 
the metadata, to, for example  looking up the URL 
<http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21605/>, seeing it's got
<link rel="alternate" 
href="http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/export/eprint/21605/EndNote/ecs-eprint-21605.enw" 
type="text/plain; charset=utf-8" title="EndNote" />
and using that to get the endnote version. Rather than just  generic 
rules; you could add rules for major websites and tools.

I've got no time to do this, but it sounds like a useful web service and 
a really fun open ended project.

I agree.
There are some existing web services which can be leveraged for this purpose (BibSonomy, CiteULike, CiteSeer, Google Scholar, ...),
and also  many subject-specific services.
Participants in the BKN project (url below) have written many python scripts for tasks like this. 
Mostly they are not yet adequately supported for widespread use, but I will be glad to share code and continue development with others. 
IP issues arise if the scripts are applied to proprietary or licensed sources.
I'd love to see someone with the necessary programming expertize and management capability initiate an open source effort or manage a webservice.  
OKFN could provide the umbrella system support for this, which could be done as part of some continuation of the BKN effort. 
OKFN or some participant in this group could try to get funding for this.  I would be glad to contribute to a proposal effort,
but do not want to take the lead.
What I think we need to see is volunteers developing code modules for various tasks, and at least a part time manager to 
oversee the codebase and installation and maintenance as a well-documented system of webservices over that codebase.
The critical component is that manager, who is needed for an ongoing commitment of time and effort, not just initial development.

True. But the article metadata in 3lib.org is mostly incomplete (e.g. missing volume and page numbers) 
so typically inferior to what is available from the sources it harvests.
What we need to generate is higher quality metadata, at least bibtex quality,
on a scale comparable scale to 3lib.
Here we run into IP issues. Many of the data providers for  3lib are unwilling to
release their complete metadata with a suitable license. But there are workarounds, e.g.
by crowdsourcing the upgrading process, and provision of generic webservices for matching 
and cleaning article records using metadata from various sources.

  It could be added from the sources that it uses. But it does
  not need that for AuthorClaim. That's why I have not added
  it.

  But harvesting will not do that. What need are stable identifiers
  so that we can feed value added services based on identifiers.
  All other information can be gotten from Google.

  No, this is not the issue. We don't have any data covering many
  fields, that's the issue.

We already have plans and (some) software for this in #jiscopenbib. I

These services scrape the scientific literature for bibliographic entries
(the metadata for a paper) and citations. [I omit citations as these are
more variable and less clear IP. Dave Shotton has a project #jiscopencite].

It is not too difficult to extract bibliography systematically and our
Crystaleye project (http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/crystaleye/summary/index.html
.does this. Its  pub-crawler software  systematically visits publisher sites
(http://bitbucket.org/ned24/pub-crawler ). We believe that publishers'
bibliographic information (journal/papewr/pages/authors is formally free of
IP restrictions - i.e.if we were taken to court we would win.). However the
actual practice is unclear and I don't particularly wish to go to court at
this moment.

pub-crawler (Java) is well-developed (it has run nightly for 4 years) and is
- of course - F/OSS. In general the crawlers only need to be per-publisher
as they generally use the same metadata for all their pubs. (This may not be
true for publishers which run services  for learned socs or who acquire
otehr publishers, e.g. Blackwell, Springer, Wiley
scientific-industrial-publisher complex)

I think there is a clear route for volunteer effort which would scale
horizontally - i.e. the management effort for a new publisher is very small.

I don't think we can look more than a year ahead but for the immediate
future we have some support resources. I also don't think we should plan too
deeply before we know what the earky results will look like.

Do you have a serials publisher that you would like to extract the
bibliographic metadata from? We could start with DOAJ since these are by
definition free of IP restrictions.

For the publishers - even closed access ones there are many advantages:#
* we are creating a unified approach to serials bibliography - i.e. all the
bibliographic data from a publisher can be held in our system. That doesn't
mean that we normalize it but we provide a basis on which it could be
normalized. (e.g. we extract dc:creator and provide a framework in which
people can decide whether it's the same as someone else's).
* we assume that we will create an Open, comprehensive and up-to-date
bibliography. There will be great value for any publisher in being included
and significant downside in being omitted.
* there will be a stunning range of new applications based on
bibliography-in-RDF. Trust us

As an example Ben has taken the exposed HTML bibliographic entries from Acta
Crystallographica E (ca 10,000) and I am taking the results to International
Union of Crystallography (the Acta C publisher) tomorrow. We will have some
exciting applications based on their (very good) metadata

So I am very optimistic that we can create a fully Open (i.e. not licensed
from elsewhere) Serials Bibliography that scales.

  But the title / authors / url information should be freely
  usable. Do you have data from that project available?

  I'd be happy to take part in this too by using the data 
  in AuthorClaim and providing data from author back. 
  But I have yet to see data from these projects.

  I'd be happy to see that. As far as I understand the larger
  sources are already on the OKFN sponsored 3lib.org.

I agree, but that doesn't stop publishers insisting it is theirs. We have to
change the culture so they agree it is Open.

We also plan to work with Biomed Central (Open Access), PLoS, and the

  The first version of what? I understood you have 10000
  records of very good metadata. Do you transform these somehow?

  All of which are probably in PubMed. Have you ever tried lobbying
  the NIH to make PubMed more widely available?

  On http://3lib.org/ you also find the following datasets in 
  original form

    *   Agris, a database about agricultural research documents from Food and Argiculture Organization  of the United Nations.
    * Current Index of Statistics data, a dump of the Current Index of Statistics in 2008?09.
    * CiteSeerX OAI_DC data, from their OAI-PMH interface, incomplete.
    * DRIVER/D-NET Metadata. This is an OAI_DC dataset collected at Bielefeld University, from the EU-funded Driver project.
    * OAI_DC data that come from OAI-PHM. The data about the archives comes from OpenDOAR. There is converter that relates the OpenDOAR records to directories with contents from the archives.

  These datasets are many times the size of the ones you plan to
  look at and they are available right now.

Pubmed has - I think - 37 million bibliographic entries. The Open subset is
considerably smaller. These will carry fully Open licences

  No, but you can ask the institutions that have provided them.
  I can help with contacts. But I don't want to do the negociations
  as I consider them a waste of effort. Once you have a service that
  is used people will be happy to give you their data for free without 
  licensing worries. That is what the experience from RePEc shows.
  As you can imagine, economists are the hardest people to get
  something for free from. 

  BTW the RePEc data is also freely available. I have not 
  copied it to 3lib because I don't think I have enough
  disk space there.

I do not regard these as negotiations. If a publishers states that there
bibliography is OKD-compliant then we record it using the IsItOpen service.
If they say no, we concentrate on others

I agree. That's why we are starting with the positive ones.

Hopefully that's got people thinking. Like I said, it's a really neat 
idea, but I've got a stack of neat ideas to work on already so have no 
time to offer to this one, except to say that we'd want to make sure 
EPrints could smoothly integrate with such a system.... although I think 
it probably could out of the box.

Hello,

tomorrow from 16:00 to 17:00 BST the working group's fourth virtual meeting will be taking place. I already collected some points to discuss, see http://okfnpad.org/4th-open-bibliography-meeting. Feel free to add end edit.

I added one point which hasn't yet been adressed: This working group's web presence. Connected to this are suggestions for collecting information about running projects and possible open data sources to be approached. I started an etherpad addressing questions like: What are the problems with the current wiki page? What text should be on the group's main wiki page? Which additional pages should be created and curated? The etherpad can be found here: http://okfnpad.org/openbiblio-group-on-the-web I'd be very happy if you could contribute - in the meeting or on this list - critique, wishes, suggestions etc.

All the best
Adrian

	CC-0
Message-ID: <4CAA00B002000014000385E1@agrippa.hbz-nrw.de>

Hello,
 
Mathias Schindler today tweeted [1] that the University Library Konstanz eventually published its data under CC-0. This is the first library outside the hbz library network to publish its data under an open license! At first they went with CC-BY-NC-SA - as Mathias already mentioned on this list [2] -  but were prompted by several people - amongst others on Germany's biggest mailing list for librarians Inetbib - to use Open Knowledge Definition compatible license.

Obviously they now have changed the licensing terms, see http://wiki.bsz-bw.de/doku.php?id=v-team:daten:openaccess:knub 
 
What might interest you even more: It's MARC data!

Cheers
Adrian

The etherpad is very confusing.
The html <title> is "4th-open-bibliography-meeting"
The first words  in the pad are "3rd virtual meeting"
then

Is it today (October 4 i.e. about now?) or tomorrow (October 5)?

I will try to participate by skype if I can manage the time.

Oups,
 
I am very sorry for that. Obviously, I was quite careless yesterday. (I copied and pasted that and then forgot to change the dates.) As it seems, you momentarily can't access the okfnpads. As soon as I can I will correct that.

> Is it today (October 4 i.e. about now?) or tomorrow (October 5)?

The meeting is today (October 5), 16:00 BST.

> I do not know what is an IRC channel or how to use it.

The instructions are here: http://okfn.org/contact/ (It's easiest to login via Mibbit.) If few people are attending we will change to skype anyway.

>> What are the problems with the current wiki page?

http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography The group got started with this wiki page but by now its content should be improved. I collected some suggestions for improvement on another etherpad (which also can't be accessed now): http://okfnpad.org/openbiblio-group-on-the-web

I have got an important publisher on board who is happy to make all their
bibliography Open. I'd like to see if we can come up with a set of
guidelines - that we agree. It's a bit rushed. I don't want to announce
names till we have agreed.  Here is my suggested starting point - it's based
towards science publishing and online material


individual works (articles, monographs, etc.) are described by a
**bibliographic entry**. This is a necessary and unique collection of
information that allows:
    - addressing (how do I find the work)
    - identification (what is the work that I have found)
If the resources are electronic then the address can be a URL and the
identification a URI (possibly based on one ore more identifier systems)

There are conventional many (semi-standard) metadata fields which describe
the work and are useful for bother discovery and identification. They
include:
* title of work
* authors, possibly including addresses and other contact details
* publisher
* dates
* title and identification of enclosing work (e.g. a journal)
* format of work (language, mimetype, document structure (number of words,
number of images, number of tables), manifest of associated files)
* rights associated with work
* abstract (usually a paragraph describing the contents of the work)
* sponsorship (e.g. funding)

We assert that this information associated with an indivdual work is in the
public domain and is compliant with the Open Knowledge Definition. To
protect its nature we wish to apply a licence asserting this nature, such as
PDDL or CC0. It follows that an indivdiual bibliographic entry derived from
the work itself is free of restrictive rights. This information can be
derived either by copying it from the pysical work itself or by visiting the
manifestation of the work on the Internet.

We agree that collections of bibliographic entries may have property rights
associated with them, but that individual entries derived from the works or
from an Open collection do not carry these restrictions.

We would include some community norms. These are not covered by the licence
but are aspirations that the community holds and which might be invoked to
restrict certain types of usage:
* a re-publisher of bibliographic information should make best-endeavour to
ensure its correctness.
* large-scale robotic collection of information may need to be agreed with
the publisher to avoid load on server
* re-publishers should avoid asserting any non-explicit  endorsement from
the publisher

Note that this assertion about the bibliographic entry for a work makes no
statement about the rights (if any associated with):
* a list of citations or a bibliography in the work
* content of text other than the abstract and fields above
* content of tables
* content of images
* content of associated files

and we believe they should be covered by separate protocols.

=================
There are many benefits to a completely Open scientific bibliography:
* discovery of works is made easier (especially through new technology).
This enhances the visibility of works
* identification of works is improved, leading to fewer mistakes in
recording bibliography.
* tools and resources can be created for scientists to speed up and enhance
quality in authoring
* bibliography can be made part of the Linked Open Data vision for the Web
* new analysis tools can be created for analysing patterns of research and
publication.


------------------------------------

They are happy for their abstracts to be in the public domain - this is a
major win. If we can get the rubric right and agreed it is a major spearhead
to get other publishers on board. If we can win ones such as nature then I
think most of the rest will follow.

P.

YES - and it maps onto the idea for (?panton) Principles for Bibliography.

I am not sure why you would want to make any such concession about property rights to collections
of biblio entries. But if you must, let me urge you to replace "collections" by "some collections" and "may" by "might".
This is going to be very dependent on local laws, and likely a difficult legal tangle.
It is important to develop best practices around ownership/control of biblio collections as well as individual records.

Great strategy, I strongly support, and will be glad to negotiate with those publishers where I have some
influence.

We would like to bring your attention to a post on the JISC Open
Bibliography project blog:

http://openbiblio.net/2010/10/05/jisc-openbibliography-cul-data-release/

In which we are very happy to announce the release of a dataset from
Cambridge University Library under PDDL licence. This dataset contains
approx. 180000 records of MARC data.

The details are on the post, including links to a CKAN package and the
raw data (one file, zipped), and we hope to announce further
developments in the near future.

ORCID, Inc. is a recently constituted non-profit organization dedicated to solving the name
ambiguity problem in scholarly research. See http://www.orcid.org/board-directors
for its board of directors and a link to the press release about its formation.

ORCID has recently polled its participants with a survey intended to gather stakeholder views on its development.
Halina Suwalowska of the Wellcome Trust <h.suwalowska at wellcome.ac.uk> is overseeing the survey, 
and encouraged me to forward to this list an invitation to participate.

I think it important for ORCID directors to hear from as many open-biblio supporters as
possible, to balance the views of those who may favor a more closed system of greater benefit to
commercial partners.
If you are willing to fill out the survey, (it only takes about 10 minutes) please email Halina to obtain a copy.
Note the deadline is just a few days away: Thursday October 14.
Let me also encourage you to register with ORCID some organization you are associated with, for similar reasons.  

I append FYI my response to the final question appealing for further comments.
I point out some issues with the survey, the existence of this group, and what I expect might
be the collective attitude of this group on these issues. 
If you wish to comment on this assessement, please do so with cc to Halina.

many thanks

----------------------------------------------------
FINAL QUESTION ON THE ORCID SURVEY:

Are any further comments you would like to give?
--------------------------------------------
Response by Jim Pitman:

Several of the questions asked me to respond as a member of a community. I belong to many communities: department, university, probability/statistics/mathematics/biblio_data subject communities. Some of my answers would be different according to community, and other considerations. e.g.
The question of whether any of these communities is willing to pay for ORCID service? Not if it is a closed membership community with closed data. Possibly if its open data, open API. Publishers already impose  a huge tax on the academic community. They could easily support a modest form of ORCID, and then license higher quality info services back to the academic community as a result. So why should the academic community pay directly for something publishers already see some benefit in?
 If its a closed membership club like Xref, count on me and others in the open biblio community 
http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography
to create and maintain a competing and I expect ultimately more successful distributed system for purposes of academic research, based on open data principles.

On the question of what data I think ORCID should keep. As long as it is open, then as much as possible, subject only to privacy and copyright laws and data quality considerations. If ORCID is a closed system, largely controlled by publishers, it should be allowed to acquire as
little data as possible to serve the function of author identification.  Authors would then
be  well advised to shun making contributions to the ORCID system, and instead maintain
their bibliographies on whatever alternative system could be developed with open data
standards. This can easily be done on university controlled web servers, using e.g.  Open Scholar software http://openscholar.harvard.edu/home to locally 
manage the data, OAI-PMH harvesting to provide aggregated views, and Google to take care of search.

This is a critical phenomenon. If ORCID is made too closed, it will fail to achieve much, and be a lose/lose for publishers and the academic community. 
If it is created according to open data principles, it has the potential to be a win/win

  For it to be open data, you need to be able to get a copy

  I am already maintaining AuthorClaim as a free system for
  authors claiming papers. Close to 100,000,000 authorships
  can be claimed there.

  In AuthorClaim, that is only the password of a user
  for the system, and the email address. The author may
  decide to make her email public, but private is the
  default setting.

  As far as I am concerned yes. There are two issues one
  should be aware of. 

  First RePEc is an aggregate of over 1200 repositories that put data
  into RePEc. None of have formally agreed to a permissions statement
  for the data. Drafting one may be difficult, adoption one surely
  would be.

  Second, an old permissions statement (I forgot where it originated
  from) prohibits the inclusion of RePEc data into products for
  sale. But actually, RePEc is included in at least one product for
  sale. And further, the statement is not likely to be worth the disk
  space it is written on since there is no legal personality or
  organization of RePEc and so nobody can really prohibit or allow
  things for that and other matters. I have tried to conceive a
  governance for RePEc. This has been in place since the beginning for
  the month, see http://governance.repec.org. I want the newly created
  board to look at the IP issues of RePEc. I expect that to happen
  soon. I hope to be able to achieve that RePEc makes no claim on
  aggregate RePEc contents. But I can't promise I can get something
  like this through the board. And the highly sophisticated nature of
  RePEc data complicates matters.

  I am the principal creator of RePEc. But I built it in such a
  non-proprietary way that I can't really influence it. And it is old
  and big so things are not changing fast.

Not true. Users of the data do not want to deal with a file containing 100M or more authorship events.
They want to have search and browse facilities over the data. If ORCID does not provide an API, then some
other agent or agents will have to. And what is the business  model to support the activity of those agents for
the benefit of the community? ORCID will be perfectly positioned to support an API, and if well constituted policitally it 
should be able to provide a good open one. That would be by far the best outcome. If we dont push for it, we wont get it.

Right. This is a foundation of what the open biblio community  could support, but we need much more than that: there needs to be an incentive
for authors to participate. Possibly if these 100,000,000 authorships were embedded in ORCID data and accessible via API, then
the incentive would be there for authors to curate their bibliographies by claiming items and upgrading the data in those items to a point
where it was useful to them e.g. in compiling CVs, displaying their data on the web, etc.

It is a vexing issue who or what agent is responsible for security of a massive system of user/passwds and email addresses. I think this
should not be entrusted to a central agent. Rather we should leverage the existing system of trusted agents for holding user/passwd info, let this be a 
distributed system, one node for each ORCID participant, and then let these particiants exchange and match data through public identity assertions, each 
with an owner  (Agent A asserts person A:1234 is sameAs B:3456 ). Let the chips fall where they may with regard to the accuracy of the assertions. 
It should be fairly easy for interested agents to detect inconsistencies and dubious assertions, and suggest corrections.  
This may not be perfect, neither is democracy, but its better than a dictatorship.

My comments on the Copyright calculator: please skype if you want more
plus:
* well made, especially visual
* good subtitles
* good range of nationalities and affiliations

downsides:
* couldn't hear some of speech very well
* WHY do we need the calculator? If you are already clued up about
copyright, would the video be interesting?
* no actual snapshots of the calculator. A flowchart is not a calculator in
most people's minds

My sugesstions for such videos is that you tell more of a story. Something
like:
* new musician wants to include a mix of performace X - can they do that in
country Y?
* lecturer wants notes with excerpts from Ulysses - is that allowed

This could show them operating the calculator and getting plus and minus
reponses.

But overall a very good start.

P.

Having looked at the UK flowchart, I wouldn't yet be comfortable 
recommending it to anyone. It might serve as a reminder to someone who 
already understood it, but for me it raises more questions than it answers.

    * What is an "unoriginal film" or database?
    * What is a "substantial change" to a database?
    * What does "fixation" mean?
    * I'm guessing EEA is European Economic Area but I'm not sure, and
      don't know how to check what that actually is. Is it different
      from the European Union?
    * What is a treaty country? Where do I find a list?
    * Why is the last bit surrounded by dashed lines?
    * Why is the very last block yellow?
    * What's a typographic arrangement?
    * When did someone last confirm that this chart was accurate? What
      was their qualification, if I'm to use it for the basis of a legal
      decision?

Other notes;

    * The use of max(a,b) and min(a,b) is going to be confusing for
      people. At least write "maximum of" and "minimum of"
    * max (term of protection in country origin) < 70 -- this is rather
      confusing. I don't understand it.
    * Also, there's a typo in "min (50 years from publication, 125 years
      from creatuion"
    * http://wiki.okfn.org/PublicDomianCalculators (linked in the PDF)
      doesn't exist!
    * Making it a PDF is a baffling roadblock for what is, essentially
      an image. PDF might be better for printing, but that's all.
    * "Microshort" looks very like "Microsoft" when you have not yet had
      coffee.

That said, there's certainly a point in collecting these various charts 
and keeping them up-to-date, but the user interface needs some thought. 
As they seem to all be multiple choice trees, it would lend itself well 
to an HTML quiz like interface. You could standardise on a simple data 
format for these;

what is it?
|-literaray, dramatic, artistic work.
| |-who is the author?
| | |-at least one known author.
| | | |-is at least one of them a EEA national or resident?
| | | | |-yes
| | | | | |-public domain 70 years after death of longest living author.
| | | | |-no
| | | | | |-work first published in European Economic Area? (add link)
| | | | | | |-yes
| | | | | | | |-public domain 70 years after death of longest living author.
| | | | | | |-no
| | | | | | | |-is one of the authors citizen of a treaty country? (add 
link)
| | | | | | | | |-yes
| | | | | | | | | |-is max (term of protection in country origin) < 70 
(I don't understand this)
| | | | | | | | | | |-no
| | | | | | | | | | | |-public domain 70 years after death of longest 
living author.
| | | | | | | | | | |-yes
| | | | | | | | | | | |-life of the longest living author plus max (term 
of protection in country of origin)
| | | | | | | | |-no
| | | | | | | | | |-public domain
| | |-anonymous or legal entity
| | | |- 70 years from (publication or creation) (whichever is greater)
| | |-a computer
| | | |- 50 years from creation
| | |-the governement: crown copyright
| | | |-published?
| | | | |-no (not commercially)
| | | | | |-125 years from creation
| | | | |-yes (commercially)
| | | | | |-50 years from publication or 125 years from creation 
(whichever is less)
|-sound recording, broadcast, performance, unoriginal film
| |-50 years from the greater of broadcast, fixing, publication.
|-unoriginal database
| |-15 years from last substantial change
|-typographic arrangements
  |-25 years from publication

Or maybe XML or some other machine readable format. That way you could 
overhaul the entire user interface without having to rebuild many random 
documents. Any 3rd year computer science student should be able to write 
some PHP to create you a choose-your-own-adventure given the above data.

However, better than all of these would be using a simple RDF/XML scheme 
as you could include multiple answers which led to the same bit of the tree;

<Question id='top'>
   <text>What type is it</text>
   <hasOption>
      <Option>
        <answer>literaray, dramatic, artistic work.</answer>
        <hasQuestion rdf:resource='#author'>
      </Option>
      <Option>
        <answer>Sound recording, broadcast, unoriginal film</answer>
        <hasResult>50 years from the greater of broadcast, fixing, 
publication.</hasResult>
      </Option>
   </hasOption>
</Question>
<Question id='author'>
  <text>who is the author?</text>
   ...etc...
</Question>

          
While this format would be better to work with, it may scare off 
contributors.

Just to reiterate that the bibliographic world is rife with true  
unknowns, so any system will have to be able to deal with incomplete  
and conflicting data because there is incompleteness and conflict in  
the real world that the metadata describes.

In case people aren't aware of it, there is a "public domain analysis"  
chart done by Peter Hirtle for the US:

http://copyright.cornell.edu/resources/publicdomain.cfm

It assumes some commonality of knowledge (e.g. "unpublished" isn't  
defined, but many users would probably understand its meaning), but I  
find the descriptions to be clear.

Quite. It can be tough for public institutions to find sufficient
funding whether for preservation of digitization.

Just to clarify :) I'm not suggesting that it is 'wrong' that the
FreeBMD data (or any other genealogical data) not be open. Only that:

a) share-alike licenses could guard against the kind of
'misappropriation' by commercial concerns that Tom cites as an issue
possibly preventing opening up of data

b) as it stands (and for reasons that may well be outside freebmd's
control), the current freebmd data is not 'open' in the sense of
<http://opendefinition.org/> (which doesn't mean it isn't still
useful!)

In the absence of another answer (as far as I can see), here's a late
one: while some co-ops claim to be non-profit and I think OCLC does
that, cooperatives are necessarily commercial.

Member economic participation is the third principle agreed by the
International Co-operative Alliance. http://www.software.coop/info/coopdev.html
http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html#3

Previously, it was more obvious, with much more talk about trading
in the Rochdale system.  http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles-revisions.html

Personally, I feel that this combines with the cooperative value of
solidarity and the sixth principle of cooperation among cooperatives,
to mean that OCLC is not a very well-behaved co-op today!  It does
seem quite enclosing and OCLC "encourages and supports the widespread,
non-commercial use of WorldCat Records" despite NC clauses hindering 
development of other co-ops.

That's something their members should correct, but I'm not sure how
OCLC helps its members to understand co-op values and principles.
http://www.oclc.org/worldcat/catalog/principles/default.htm seems a
pale parody of http://www.ica.coop/coop/principles.html

Hope that helps,

Just to clarify further, I wasn't suggesting that the current situation
isn't completely insane - dozens of people repeatedly transcribing the
same stuff  then squirreling it away in half-hidden places.. All I meant
to say was that people have got used to this mad situation, and even
find justifications for it. It would be good to have an argument that
takes on those justifications.

There is also an insidious overuse of copyright by people who should
know better - this summer I was asked to sign a form recognising an
archive's copyright over a document from 1670, when I wanted to take a
photo of it (there are several perfectly valid reasons for not allowing
photos to be made but copyright really isn't one). Many people in
genealogy, and even some archivists, have come to believe that copyright
law is something it really isn't.

Agreed. And it would be good to come up with an approach which would
enable making a much wider ranger of genealogical data free in the full
sense.

Note that this statement was most likely written many years prior to
any UK open gov/open data initiatives being a glimmer in anyone's eye.
 Anyone writing in the same time period would likely have said it
would be a cold day in hell before any government collected geo data
was freely available.

The social/cultural uniqueness of the genealogical community is still
relevant, but it could well be that if you convinced the FreeBMD
leadership of the merit of asking, they'd be able to get the
government to change the terms of the agreement without as much
difficulty as was historically believed to be true.

The counter argument to this is that increased availability and
awareness of the documents generates a larger number advocates (and
voters) to lobby for continued or increasing funding.  People don't
like paying for dusty old documents that sit neglected in a vault, but
it can be quite a different story for things which are used on a daily
basis by thousands of passionate voting lobbyists.

Not all of this is intentional.  Some is just a lack of knowledge.  I
still see people hand transcribing pages from local history/genealogy
books even when those same pages are available in Google Books.
Cemetery transcriptions may still be done in Word rather than Excel
or, shock, horror, a real database just because that's what's most
accessible and familiar.

Having said that, there's is a significant undercurrent of people not
wanting their data "stolen" by others -- and not just commercial
interests.  Troll any genealogy forum and there are always complaints
of some ancestor or other stealing "their" data.  I think the solution
to this is part technological, part social.  If there was a strong
culture of attribution and the technical underpinnings to make it
easy, I think an education campaign could be mounted to get people to
publish early so that they get credit for their work.

Absolutely, but I'm not saying to not try or that it's not a
worthwhile goal.  I'm happy to help anyone who wants to work in this
space.

Are you sure the archive was asserting copyright?  It's not uncommon
for libraries and archives to make stipulations like this in their
membership or reader card/researcher agreements.  It has nothing to do
with copyright and under the guise of contract law, they can basically
make whatever demands they want in return for permission to research
in the archives.  You have the choice of agreeing to the conditions
(and being bound by them) or finding a different place to research.  I
think it sucks too, but it's certainly well within the bounds of the
law (as I understand it, not being a lawyer).

If your "non-other" (to coin a word) government is the U.S.
government, my understanding is that works produced by their employees
are in the public domain *in the U.S.* and that they may be subject to
copyright in other jurisdictions.  I suspect that, like non-commercial
and share-alike clauses, this can complicate the task of reusing and
remixing the data in non-obvious ways downstream.

"Noncommercial" is hard to define and AFAIK it doesn't have an
established legal definition.  The article linked from the following
page might be useful to someone who wants to dive deeper:

   http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Defining_Noncommercial

In the case of OCLC (and similar nonprofits such as W3C, Crossref, and
CAS) the question is whether the nonprofit is using the work for
financial gain. I can't predict what a court would say.

I don't monitor this list regularly. If in the future you have
Creative Commons related questions you might want to cc: me (so to
speak) or email me directly.

Message-ID: <AANLkTikouGB4zrgQVBZ-zjcxObyXKWUDCqvmYm-K8SKA@mail.gmail.com>

I have been asked to do a plenary session at this meeting on
"Democratisation of Knowledge". I've called it something like:
"Open Bibliography - a practical session in JISC-OKF Democratisation of
Knowledge"
The idea (which any of you are welcome to refine) is that we shall start now
and set some sort of target for the meeting - e.g. writing letters to
publishers asking them to read and hopefully sign the Open Bibliography
Principles. I'd also like to see how far we can crowdsource creation of
resources for automatic extraction of serial bibliographic data - nothing
illegal of course.

Current ideas are based on the event that JISC and I ran at the BL
http://scienceonlinelondon.wikidot.com/topics:green-chain-reaction
where we had a wiki and an OKFPad. In many ways simply exposing our current
open-bibliography discussions and progress will be valuable

And of course this is communal and global - I hope this catalyses other
ideas.

Talis Prism 3 is a next-generation OPAC/search and discovery interface. We need to offer a rich interface to surface the large volume of content available in libraries. Browsing by entities such as author, subject and series is important, as is the reliable extraction of data from MARC 21 into a linked data model.

In some existing systems, the data is handled as literal text with no notion of concrete entities such as a particular author, their relation to other authors (e.g. pseudonyms), or their actual contribution (e.g. editor, illustrator etc.).

> === Goal ===
>
> Two short statements stating (1) what is achieved in the scenario

> technology to achieve this goal.

1. A rich search and discovery interface for libraries
2. Prism 3 is powered by the Talis Platform, a hosted linked data service which offers both SPARQL querying and powerful full text search capabilities. We?ve made certain parts of the bibliographic data first class entities (author, but soon to include title and subject); this will allow us to offer multiple entry points into the data, either by search and faceting, or browsing through author and subject indexes. By making title and author first class entities we can also identify alternate versions of resources and allow that information to be discovered, e.g. finding all editions of a book or finding all versions of a work (book, film, theatrical adaptation etc.). We are also looking to link to data from external resources such as dbpedia for author/person biographies and MusicBrainz for track listings/artist information.

Public and academic libraries and their users.

Users can:

? Search for books/resources by simple keyword, targeted index (author, ISBN, title etc) or a combination of both; Boolean operators and groupings are also supported
? Refine their results using facets
? View item level details
? Expand their search by browsing to subjects/authors contained in those records, e.g. find all other books written or contributed to by this author, find all books that are about this author, find all books about World War 2 etc.
? Enjoy serendipitous discovery of other items they may not have been searching for, but would find interesting nonetheless
? Experience intelligent suggestions to broad searches, e.g. searching for Shakespeare should offer a link to a biographical page about him, as well as returning lists of books that satisfy the query.

We also want to enable developers to build applications and mashups on top of the bibliographic data.

By promoting as many parts of the record as possible to first class entities, opening up a browsable interface becomes much easier. Describing all resources attached to another one is very powerful and provides far better results than by using full text searching alone. It also allows richer integration with other data sources.

Some other OPAC?s appear to use full text search features to power a browsing interface, e.g. synonym searching for lists of related items/terms. Many traditional systems also use relational databases as their underlying data storage layer.

FOAF - basic person (author/character) information
Bibliontology - bulk of the bibliographic record
Dublin Core - more general bibliographic elements (title, creator etc.) as well as medium/format
BIO - biographical information about people (birth/death date)
Music Ontology - audio/musical catalogue items
Organizational Ontology - corporate authorship

The linked-data aspect of the project is allowing us great flexibility - there have been a few cases where finding the correct ontology/class/property to use has been problematic, but this can be overcome either by working with the ontology creators to broaden an existing one, or by defining our own.

The biggest technical challenge has been with extracting information from MARC 21 records, as much of the content is comprised of literals. Promoting authors to first class objects requires the use of external data sources such as authority files (which we?ve also modelled as linked data). The same hurdles will need to be overcome when we start dealing with subjects as entities.

There is also the problem of augmenting the data we already have: one example is birth/death information for authors, which isn't always catalogued in a MARC 21 record; this necessitates the use of other resources that can fill in missing details. With current systems, keeping this external data alongside the catalogue data in a single store is important for quick responses to queries and robust continuation of service, so we have to deal with the issue of keeping this data current - if an author dies we need to track this event and update our store, preferably in an automated fashion.

We have made a conscious decision to include a Linked Data API in Talis Prism 3, scheduled for release early next year. By surfacing the linked-data in a machine readable way through this interface we?re hoping to enable unanticipated uses as developers harness the data in other applications.

Some example use cases may include:

? Surfacing library data in a mobile application
? Allowing aggregation many institution's holdings into a shared union catalogue
? Enabling resource/reading list systems to automatically harvest information to populate their interfaces (one example would be Talis Aspire, a linked data resource list management system)

If I understand "soft law" I assume I would favour it. The problem is that
it isn't a defence against hard law. And at present we are paralysed by the
fear of hard law in many areas.

So if soft law is a mechanism to persuade the IPR community that
bibliography should be public, great.

Also if the PSI is releasing bibliography, that that could be useful.

I can't imagine anyone not answering  this as "Yes" other than people who
make money out of walled gardens.

My question is - if you anser "yes" to this what action are you going to
take :-)

W3C Library Linked Data Incubator Group -
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/

Call for Use Cases: Library Linked Data

Are you currently using linked data technology [1] for library-related
data, or
considering doing it in the near future? If so, please tell us more by
filling
in the questionnaire below and sending it back to us or to
public-lld at w3.org <mailto:public-lld at w3.org>,
preferably before October 15th, 2010.

The information you provide will be influential in guiding the
activities the
Library Linked Data Incubator Group will undertake to help increase global
interoperability of library data on the Web. The information you provide
will
be curated and published on the group wikispace at [3].

We understand that your time is precious, so please don't feel you have to
answer every question. Some sections of the templates are clearly marked as
optional. However, the more information you can provide, the easier it
will be
for the Incubator Group to understand your case. And, of course, please
do not
hesitate to contact us if you have any trouble answering our questions.
Editorial guidance on specific points is provided at [2], and examples are
available at [3].

We are particularly interested in use cases describing the use of library
linked data for end-user oriented applications. However, we're not ruling
anything out at this stage, and the Incubator Group will carefully consider
all submissions we receive.

On behalf of the Incubator Group, thanks in advance for your time,

================================================================
================================================================

=== Name ===

A short name by which we can refer to the use case in discussions.

=== Owner ===

The contact person for this use case.

=== Background and Current Practice ===

Where this use case takes place in a specific domain, and so requires
some prior
information to understand, this section is used to describe that domain.
As far
as possible, please put explanation of the domain in here, to keep the
scenario
as short as possible. If this scenario is best illustrated by showing
how applying
technology could replace current existing practice, then this section
can be used
to describe the current practice. Often, the key to why a use case is
important
also lies in what problem would occur if it was not achieved, or what
problem
means it is hard to achieve.

=== Goal ===

Two short statements stating (1) what is achieved in the scenario without
reference to linked data, and (2) how we use linked data technology to
achieve
this goal.

=== Target Audience ===

The main audience of your case. For example scholars, the general
public, service
providers, archivists, computer programs...

=== Use Case Scenario ===

The use case scenario itself, described as a story in which actors
interact with
systems. This section should focus on the user needs in this scenario.
Do not
mention technical aspects and/or the use of linked data.

=== Application of linked data for the given use case ===

This section describes how linked data technology could be used to
support the
use case above. Try to focus on linked data on an abstract level, without
mentioning concrete applications and/or vocabularies. Hint: Nothing library
domain specific.

=== Existing Work (optional) ===

This section is used to refer to existing technologies or approaches
which achieve
the use case (Hint: Specific approaches in the library domain). It may
especially
refer to running prototypes or applications.

=== Related Vocabularies (optional) ===

Here you can list and clarify the use of vocabularies (element sets and
value
vocabularies) which can be helpful and applied within this context.

=== Problems and Limitations (optional) ===

This section lists reasons why this scenario is or may be difficult to
achieve,
including pre-requisites which may not be met, technological obstacles
etc. Please
explicitly list here the technical challenges made apparent by this use
case. This
will aid in creating a roadmap to overcome those challenges.

=== Related Use Cases and Unanticipated Uses (optional) ===

The scenario above describes a particular case of using linked data.
However, by
allowing this scenario to take place, the likely solution allows for
other use
cases. This section captures unanticipated uses of the same system
apparent in the
use case scenario.

=== References (optional) ===

This section is used to refer to cited literature and quoted websites.

We?ve made certain parts of the bibliographic data first class entities (author, but soon to include title and subject); this will allow us to offer multiple entry points into the data, either by search and faceting, or browsing through author and subject indexes. By making title and author first class entities we can also identify alternate versions of resources and allow that information to be discovered, e.g. finding all editions of a book or finding all versions of a work (book, film, theatrical adaptation etc.). We are also looking to link to data from external resources such as dbpedia for author/person biographies and MusicBrainz for track listings/artist information.

Hello,

until now there's no concrete feedback yet to the principle draft but
there have been some retweets on twitter [1]. A tweet by John Dupuis
[2] pointed out that the Openbiblio blog was lacking licensing
information.

I now licensed the blog under a CC-BY-license. I believe everyone
agrees on a CC-BY-Llicencse as for other OKFN related content [3]. I
first had doubts to license the whole blog all by myself and thought
about asking permission as there are other people who provided the
main part of the content. But at last I thought in the OKFN context it
is clear that the content is open. I hope nobody has any problems with
this approach.

Anyone fancy responding to this? ;-)

"Ideally, I?d like a site that is an open commons, maintained by an
institution that has some legs. It should present my biblio in
standard readable and re-citable forms, but should also treat it as
data in a database so that it can be refactored. I?d love for it to
have LibraryThing?s social functionality. And in a perfect world, it?d
let me enter just some key data, look it up, and fill in the rest in
perfectly formatted form. (Again, LibraryThing does cool stuff in this

Subject: [open-bibliography] Open Bibliography,
	the Democratisation of Knowledge at RLUK 2010 in Edinburgh
Message-ID: <AANLkTinLOD4AZdabe9oocwSzFVzck15--egc55nvYgY8@mail.gmail.com>

I have been invited to run a session at this meeting - see  Open
Bibliography, the Democratisation of Knowledge and the Scottish
Enlightenment at RLUK
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2645

This is a wonderful opportunity for the OKF to make a major public
contribution to Open Bibliography. I am suggesting:

   - Participants to get at least one signature from their institution
   supporting the OKF Open Bibliography Principles. (If these are new to you,
   read the last week on this blog and also http://openbiblio.net/ ). All it
   does is ask you to agree that Open Bibliography is a Good Thing. If you can
   get a vice-chancellor or a head librarian that?s great. But if not, just
   sign it yourself. [OKF ? TODO we need a signup list]. This can, of course,
   be done worldwide
   - It would be really great to get a Scottish commitment to Open
   Bibliography. Scotland has recently prided itself (rightly) on adopting
   Openness more rapidly than England, and I think this could be done. I can?t
   tell you how to do it, but if it seems achievable, please have a go.
   - Each participant should write to one primary publisher asking for their
   commitment to Open Bibliography. Again the OKF has pioneered this type of
   request mechanism with its IsItOpen(Data) for asking about the Openness of
   scientific information. We?d hope to develop this during the month. In
   principle (since Bibliography is de facto Open) every publisher should be
   glad to sign up as it would mean more exposure for their publications. But
   we shall suggest you choose the most favourable first
   - [UPDATE ? how could I have failed to think of this] A communally
   produced Open Bibliography on the Democratisation of Knowledge.

If we are successful ? and we shall be since it depends on YOU ? we shall
then have:

   - A large and compelling list of institutions worldwide which are
   committed to (or have at least employees committed to) Open Bibliography
   - A united stance from Scotland
   - A growing list of publishers who have asserted that their bibliography
   is Open.
   - A world-class Open Bibliography on the Democratisation of Knowledge

I'm optimistic we can make this happen. A month is long enough.

I have asked that OKF'ers in Edinburgh be able to physically participate in
the session. Though it's not essential - I always plan for levels of success
- it would be great to have a small group of identifiable warm bodies.

There is a commitment for the OKF in general. I think this is manageable but
includes:

   - Etherpads (almost trivial as we do it all the time)
   - Wiki/blog/Trac (we have most of this in generic form). Exactly which
   will be used we don't know
   - IsItOpenBibliography. A tool to ask publishers to assert that their
   bibliography is open. This is probably the hardest and shouldn't be required
   if the cost in effort is too great. OTOH volunteers would be great
   - A signup list for supporting the Open Bibliographic principles
   - A weekly skypecon

The benefits are potentially large. Assuming we manage to generate
significant core resources then OKF Open Bibliography could become an
important tool in world scholarship.

Comments and suggestions - particularly EARLY ones - will be very valuable.
And of course you don't have to be physically in Edinburgh.

Yes, completely agree with CC-by, I'd also suggest that we should link to:

<http://okfn.org/ip-policy/>

As it makes clear e.g. what the email address is for take-down for
infringing content (should that ever be an issue!)

=== name ===

Community Information Service

=== Owner ===

Jim Pitman
http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~pitman/

=== Background and Current Practice ===

Academic organizations of varying sizes (research groups, university departments,
universities, university consortia, subject specific communities such as scholarly societies and special interest groups) 
have a strong interest in maintaining awareness and quality of information in their domain, and in openly publishing this
information to the broader academic community and to the general public.
A significant component of this information is bibliographic metadata available from library resources, 
especially information about books and articles published in a particular field, or associated with a particular
institution.
Current practice varies greatly.  Many publishers and scholarly societies offer subscription-based A&I services which are paid
for by libraries. Typical license agreements limit these services to "individual" use.
This inhibits creative selection, remixing  and republication  of bibliographic metadata by interested individuals and organizations.
Another service is provided by Google Scholar.  But again, selective harvesting and reuse of the data is inhibited by terms of use.

Most university departments and universities are unable to extract from their university library catalogs a list of all publications
of their own faculty. Even if they could, they are typically not be allowed to publish it without renegotiating license agreements with
bibliographic metadata suppliers.
A typical subject-specific interest group may be able to extract subject-specific bibliographic metadata from a variety of sources.
But again, there is a high barrier to cross before the group can obtain clear rights to republish or remix such material.
Essentially, the group has to acquire some legal identity, capable of making licensing agreements, before it can do so legally.
Then the group has to find a business model capable of supporting some individual whose job it is to manage such agreements.
This organizational overhead is unnecessary in a universe of linked data. 

=== Goal ===

Make libary catalog and other publisher-genetated bibliographic metadata freely available to community data curators so it is easily filtered by 
author/affiliation/subject/... to allow large numbers of small to medium sized academic communities to easily extract what data is of particular interest to them, 
with minimal technical and legal overhead, and to openly republish that data in ways they find worthwhile. For example, by selecting, ranking or 
classifying the data, and providing simple searches and faceted displays over bibliographic collections of special interest to the community.

How to use linked data technology to achieve this goal: provide the data with an open license which allows its reuse for such purposes,
and support the APIs, data standards and client software to lower the barrier to participation in information curation and sharing.

=== Target Audience ===

Scholars as service providers: all those who edit, curate and arrange scholarly information for the purpose of making it openly
accessible to a wide audience.
Indirectly, the general public which may find subject-specific resources curated by scholars more informative 
than generic search services or Wikipedia.
Computer programs, inasmuch as these may be used for tasks of filtering, deduplication,  selection, ... to save the time of expert curators.

=== Use Case Scenario ===

Curator of a community information service selects data from input sources to determine what books, articles, photographs, videos, .... 
 were published recently which would be of interest to the community. 
Curator has input data available in such a way that they can easily control what is piped through to their information service.

=== Application of linked data for the given use case ===

Make it easy for data providers (publishers, libraries, other aggregators) to provide linked data with suitable API and client software 
for community data curators to use.
Curators should expect that bibliographic records come equipped with identifiers for all entities
(editions, people, subjects, journals, publishers, .... ) and that this information is easily loaded into some
community managed CMS to allow remixing with whatever ranking/selection/faceting/... the community service may wish to provide.

=== Existing Work (optional) ===

Most A&I services maintain some data ingest systems for these purposes. But they are usually proprietary, and not readily available for use by smaller agents with 
interests in biblio data curation.  These mostly rely on converting raw publisher data into proprietary biblio formats for internal use, and licensing 
data to libraries in degraded formats for use by supplicant scholars.  These services add no value to the universe of linked data, but rather compete with it.
Some examples of software systems for open display of community curated bibliographic collections are
BibSonomy, BibServer, BibApp, Open Scholar. All of these systems would benefit from easy
availability of comprehensive linked library and publisher data via  API.
An example of a typical community website which would benefit greatly from integration with linked data is the Probability Web. 
See especially the lists of Books, People, and the link to the Probability Abstract Service, all of which could be
recreated to both import and export linked data.
There are more advanced services in other fields, especially RePEc (laudably open, but with large amounts of data whose license status is indeterminate)
and SSRN (free but not open to reuse). Such large community services are typically built with an architecture that is difficult to replicate. 
What is needed is a simple and easily replicable architecture for community data curation services of various sizes to develop and interoperate.
BKNpeople and VIVO  are starts in this direction at the level of identifying people and their interests. Integation of
such systems with the ORCID initiative will be important. See also the BKN Project.

=== Related Vocabularies ===

BIBO, CiTO, ... 

=== Problems and Limitations ===

Reasons why this scenario is or may be difficult to achieve:

Social/Economic/Legal
-- vested interests in A&I services
-- lack of suitably licensed metadata
-- commercial publishers, universities and conservative scholarly societies  refusing to release their metadata with an open license

Technical obstacles:
Lack of convergence towards a simple widely adopted standard for exchange of bibliographic metadata suitable for the community
information service use case.
The necessary data fields are little more than traditional bibtex fields, plus some conventions for handling entity identifiers and links.
BibJSON is an attempt at an adequate lightweight data exchange standard, compatible with linked data principles,
and influenced by the success of BibTeX and RePEc's Academic Metadata Format.
This standard is easily managed and understood by typical community data service managers, even without advanced software tools.
Providing and managing/adapting/maintaining good UIs for non-technical curators to manage BibJSON or similar record structures is the biggest technical challenge.
Also, supporting the necessary CMS over which these UIs can operate.
Needlebase shows promise of providing an adequate UI over a graphical datastore.
This is proprietary software, but it should be configurable to import and export linked data. Such systems for managing simple editorial
workflows over linked data are greatly needed.

=== Related Use Cases and Unanticipated Uses ===

If simple and easily affordable editorial systems are developed for managing collections of biblio data, it is hard to anticipate

Thomas sent us two use cases back in September; his New Economic Papers use case is already linked on the wiki and discussed on the topics list. I've just added the AuthorClaim use case, as well:
http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/wiki/Use_Case_AuthorClaim

Thanks for your use cases, Thomas, and especially for making sure we didn't forget this one!

Hi Jim,

This looks like a mail hiccup, resending the use case recently posted:

If not, please let us know!

Here are some more technical observations:

http://ckan.net/package/jiscopenbib-cul-1 links to http://openbiblio.net/2010/10/04/jisc-openbibliography-cul-data-release which gives a 404.

Also wget doesn't like the http://storage.ckan.net/openbiblio/CUL_dataset1-20100705 URL.

It gives me this error:

wget works when --no-check-certificate is used.

Can someone please provide a description of this dataset? Some idea
of what range of years and subjects? Or how this dataset was collected or conceived?
Of course its nice to see any dataset in PDDL. But it is not much of a service to
release hundreds of thousands of records with no indications of what's in there. 

Is it expected that everyone on the list is going to jump in and see if there's anything there 
they care about?  I'd like to see a higher standard of dataset description before dataset release 
announcments on this list.

Or maybe we need some preliminary stage inviting volunteers to provide dataset descriptions if
dataset providers are unwilling or unable to do so.

many thanks

Jim,
I think this is typical of many projects where data is released into the
Open. The key thing is that it has been Opened and that can never be undone.

As an example if March the UK released a lot of Open data RDF under
data.gov.uk.  There was a competition to see who could build the best
mashup. Jim Downing put all his skills - not just in RDF but also in working
with government and could find almost nothing that made immediate sense. We
managed to work out there were 4218.657 cows in Northumberland. We never
found out where the 0.43 cow went.

Effectively the RDF was a dump of database tables without the schemas.

In the following case the key thing is that the data have been released. Ben
O'Steen will be able to give you a better idea as he is both an expert in
RDF and also in bibliography. But my guess is that it's a dump of part of a
proprietary library management system which is impenetrable and probably
designed to create lockin. I also guess that they have done a dump and have
relatively little control over what comes out. Also they have to make sure
that the data is Open.

we should be able to determine what it is by the content. I am increasingly
uncovinced of the value of human cataloguing - machines do as good a job.

I'd be delighted to see this. It would be wornderful. And if we are really
really focussed we cvould report the preliminary results at RLUK2010 in a
month

That's neither fair nor possible. The data have been produced by CUL as a
gift to the project. They have no dedicated finance for this and their work
to extract and liberate the data is much appreciated .  The alternative
would be to:
* prepare a case for support for a 2-year release proposal.
* get funded (improbable but who knows)
* wait two years.

So we are two years ahead. We can either regard this dataset as imperfect or
we can exult at having got such a lot to work with. I take the latter view.
If you don't feel happy looking at imperfect data, shut your eyes for a few
months and see what we come up with.

Please don't say "unwilling". They're not. They just don't have any spare
resource.

I think that volunteers are absolutely the key.  I think that if we create
the right types of volunteer community then we can make the world's
biblographic information Open within 2 years maximum.

We would be delighted for you to be involved. But the mental approach has
elements of uncovering an archeological site. Not completely, but my guess
is that the library management systems are closed books and we have to
decipher what comes out.

And, in any case, suppose the collection was ALL the books in the library.
Wouldn't that be a complete description.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Changes on openbiblio wiki
Message-ID: <AANLkTinNMLiHHdZSp97iUkogNpiSqcbXk7NrVrfjQD=O@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

having some time to think about the ongoing developments and
activities led me to do two things:

1. I wrote a blog post (in German) about Open Bibliographic Data in
2010: http://www.uebertext.org/2010/10/2010-das-open-bibliographic-data-jahr.html

2. I rearranged the Working Group's web presence a bit.

About the group's wiki:

* The main page is now filled with less information and better to
oversee: http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography
* I added a paragraph "Activities" to the main page which mentions
some of the group's activities.
* I moved several content to new wiki pages:
  ** An overview over the group's members and associated persons:
http://wiki.okfn.org/Openbiblio%20Members
  ** A list of etherpads the group has created:
http://wiki.okfn.org/List%20of%20Openbiblio%20etherpads
  ** A list projects and services in the realm of Open Bibliographic
Data: http://wiki.okfn.org/relevant%20projects Please add missing
projects and services.

What do you think about the changes? Is this web presence readable for
people who have no clue what the group is doing but who are vaguely
interested in the group's work?

What is missing?/To Do
- I think we need a short text describing what the group's purpose is
and what it does. But for now, the three bullet points on the main
page do the job...
- The paragraph "Research" on the main page has to be moved to a seperate page.

Ciao
Adrian

Adrian,
I think this is a good improvement. I know how hard one has to work.

It's a good resource for those involved in the project(s) and that's
imporrtant. I can now find the Etherpads, etc. For example I need to know
whether I have a skypecon this afternoon and when. A list of these would be
useful

Fo newcomers we have two sorts:
* those who know what bibliography is and are probably involved elsewhere
* those that don't (they may even think it's biography)

For those I'd suggest a pointer to a new page entitiled something like:
"Why is Bibliography Important and what are we doing about it"

and then list on that some of the challenges we are tackling and some of the
star progress.

P.

I think this is a secondary audience at this time. The primary audience should be those on this list who
are already committed to openbiblio activities, as a means of sharing information, raising awareness
of each others efforts and projects, avoiding duplication of effort, and encouraging productive collaborations
to form. 

> What is missing?/To Do
Here are some suggestions.

Those interested in bibliographic data management and cleaning workflows need a list of available software tools,
data sources and webservices. I am thinking especially about article metadata, which is very different to book metadata from
a socio-economic perspective.
For the tools, comments on their purpose, usability, flexibility, ...... Whether they are
proprietary or open source, well maintained, ....

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software

is a great start, and we should not duplicate this. I would suggest rather scripting the data out of those tables 
and supplementing with our own notes.
We especially need some commentary on the suitability of some these software systems 
e.g. JabRef, Zotero, BibSonomy, Mendeley, .....  for openbiblio purposes. The perspective of the wikipedia article
is that of the individual user. What is missing is the perspective of the bibliographer who wishes to use such
tools to publish bibliographies back to the web.  So there is the question of what formats are available as machine export,
what license restrictions there might be imposed on the export by the sytem, etc.

We also need information about more advanced tools and services like reference parsing software, e.g. ParsCit, ...

For projects, I'd like to see for each project a few sentences of roadmap, what its goals are, extent of support,
number of FTE committed to the project, timeframe, ....

For publishers and A&I services, I'd like to see something like http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/ for metadata policies.
Is their metadata open? If so in exactly what legal sense and in what format? How to get in bulk? How to get by webservice? .....
Does the service permit users to publish selected data  back to the web in open formats?

Possibly this could be done as an OKFN project under the SHERPA umbrella.
The number of non OA publishers with certifiably open metadata is so small at this time that the challenge is just to get the first entries on the list.  
For OA publishers, the issue is how to get at the data easily. Even a list of aggregators of OA materials which provided good machine access
to biblio data would be useful.

more than enough suggestions for one email!
cheers

Unfortunately, the main description and grouping of this dataset is
simply "the metadata records that Cambridge University Library feel that
haven't been copied or combined with data from OCLC and other suppliers"

As such, it typically refers to items that are peculiar to Cambridge's
collection, varying from maps to manuscripts. As I've stated, the rhyme
and reason of this collection has nothing to do with the content - the
aggregation is due solely to licence considerations made by CUL.

Not much of a theme, but such is the data. This package is purely the
source material we received from CUL - nothing has been done to it, but
it is published as this is the key data that any subsequent set relies
on, and it is the package that defines the base licence of any
subsequent curated sets.

So, yes, it's not that interesting and it is very ill-defined from a
content POV, but it needs to exist so we can indicate provenance of data
and licence. Without which, any questionable assertion, bias, encoding,
ontological choice or assumption I make in creating a more 'reusable' or
curated version of it, cannot be checked against the original matter.
(Especially with regards to CUL's interpretation of MARC fields and the
way they have extended it over the years - which is a issue that is not
just found with CUL data of course.)

I would very much favour a wiki or similar for CKAN packages, where data
triage and characterisation can be discussed on a per-package basis.

Thanks Ben, it  would be very useful if that description could be
posted in the OKFN record for the dataset.
A general question with all these library releases, is what is the increment
in value over the OL dataset which already has a nice API?
What agent is willing to track the deltas as new datasets come online?
Another question is the extent to which OL data qualifies according to the 
OKFN's open data criteria. I find the OL terms of use statement http://www.archive.org/about/terms.php
fairly opaque. OL used to have a statement that they regarded their data as public
domain, but  this seems to have been withdrawn. Maybe Karen could comment on this?

My strong support for this. 
To avoid duplication of effort it is important to have a central place where agents planning or 
conducting data triage and characterisations can report their plans and activities. Then we should 
try to encourage a culture in this group to post to that place, and to look there before embarking 
on such efforts.

I also strongly agree with Peter that we should encourage dumps of open data first, and
ask questions about quantity and quality later. The rate of dumps of library data is currently
exceeding the capacity of this community to process them into usable forms. But that should not slow 
down the open dumping.  I think that the process of data cleaning and enhancement by agents with 
domain-specific interests would be accelerated if some agents could do preliminary triage and 
characterisations and report on the results. Then other agents might be motivated to step in and 
improve the data further.

I agree with Jim that a small amount of information would make  
datasets like this more useful. It's like we need a "dublin core for  
data sets." I happen to be at this year's DC meeting, which starts  
tomorrow, and I know that there are folks here who are interested in  
metadata for data sets. I'll keep an ear to that ground to see if I  
can find out who is in that conversation.

The other thing that concerns me is updating of data sets. Some data  
is useful even without updates (especially if more data may come from  
different sources), but some data really needs to be updated to be  
useful (e.g. price data, ownership data, rights data). That gets us  
into the 'provenance' question that w3c is looking at, but also into  
versioning of data (so you know if it's from yesterday or 5 years ago).

This doesn't mean that it's not a good idea for people to put their  
data out there even if these details haven't been worked out. We need  
large amounts of data to experiment with this whole linked open data  
concept. Soon, though, I hope we'll get far enough along that we will  
want to resolve some of these other issues that will make the data  
even more useful. We can have the discussion today even if we can't  
resolve the issues for a while.

I don't know why the terms of use was changed, but it's clear that the  
Internet Archive's terms come out of the mouths of lawyers whose job  
is the keep the IA out of trouble (or at least to make sure the  
trouble doesn't stick -- the Archive has been through a number of  
significant lawsuits). However, note that when you manually edit a  
record, you see this:

"By saving a change to this wiki, you agree that your contribution is  
given freely to the world under CC0. Yippee!"

Any site where data is compiled from a number of sources is going to  
find it difficult to make statements about licensing or public domain  
-- if you aren't the creator of the data, it is very unclear what  
rights you can assert. The long terms of use on the IA page is really  
saying: "It's not our stuff, so we have nothing to say about its  
rights." In essence, OL could say the same -- they have simply  
gathered data from a number of sources, some of which did not give  
explicit permission.

This means that data sets like CUL have an advantage over OL because  
the library is able to make assertions about rights for records it  
created, purchased, or significantly modified.

And, BTW, it's actually a Good Thing that the CUL dataset has mainly  
records for odd-ball things that only they own -- these records are  
less likely to overlap with other datasets, and more likely to provide  
new data. We've got enough metadata for Harry Potter books; we should  
encourage libraries to contribute to the very long tail of published  
works.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Open Bibliography and RLUK
Message-ID: <AANLkTinzKcuMGViToG_FB-omp4EQXmXf9mpASYqPPZ+_@mail.gmail.com>

Ben and I spoke today and we think it's feasible to launch a citizen project
for exploring the BL catalugue in the 3 weeks before RLUK in Edinburgh where
I will run a session on our results. The goals are flexible, but a simple
start would be to ask people to search the BL catalogue for books they have.
There could be incentives to see who gets the most new hits, other other
games.

In any case it will be really important and great to get involvement and
encouragement from this list. We can do a great deal if we get enough
volunteers . So we need to think of a range of simple tools.

See:
http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2658

I shall defer to Ben on most matters.

Thanks to all who make this list exciting

P.

At CARET we're looking into reference managers from a slightly different point of view - just to learn more about which are used at Cambridge and for what purposes, mostly (as part of a different JISC project - ConnectedWorks).  I think we could add some questions for our survey/interviews/etc around open bibliography; I know there are already concerns in some areas of the campus around tool sustainability just for academic use (and open source plays a role here) and so this might be fruitful.  It would be interesting to both raise awareness of openbiblio as a possibility as well as finding out whether our academics have an appetite for it. 

Best regards, 

Laura

First of all, just to make sure people have heard of voID 
http://semanticweb.org/wiki/VoiD ((from "Vocabulary of Interlinked 
Datasets") is an RDF based schema to describe linked datasets.) It 
sounds like it has a heavy overlap with dcat.

Secondly, unless I've missed it there's something missing from both and 
I don't think it can be usefully dealt with by schema, but rather 
requires convention.

That is to tell people what they can expect to get back if they resolve 
the URI of the dataset, or the URIs of elements within the dataset. What 
I'm proposing is that people should mint RDF classes which describe a 
certain pattern or structure. If that pattern is not specific to their 
archive, they should ideally use a neutral domain for it so that it can 
be reused by other orgs. without stigma.

I plan to write a blog post on this soon, but by way of example, here's 
the basic ontology for an EPrints repository:  
http://www.eprints.org/ontology/ -- you'll see that I indicate what 
you'll get back if you resolve a URI of class EPrint or Repository. This 
is slightly semantically shonky as it describes a property of the URI 
and not the concept represented by the URI. sameAs does not apply in 
this case!

While some datasets may be global, and worth the time and effort to 
build custom interfaces for, others are not. For smaller and local 
datasets, such as a bibliography, its better to indicate what standard 
pattern you are using.

A) For example, the most simple would be (I'm guessing) a pattern where 
the bibliography is a single RDF+XML document containing an unordered 
collection of records containing flat dublin-core metadata.

B) The other simple one is a URI which, if resolved, will return an 
RDF+XML document containing a bunch of triples relating that URI to a 
set of bibligraphic records held on other systems, simple dublin core 
may be included, but should not be relied on. rdf:type may be available 
to indicate what the records may be, or the pattern(s) they fulfill, but 
again optionally.

Basically, it would be really useful for a consuming application to know 
if you're dealing with an (A) or (B). If (B) then you probably need to 
resolve all the URIs, in the case of A this is pointless. This may not 
be a big deal on a single list of 10 items, but machine readable cues 
about the value of resolving linked data URIs will be important as 
systems scale.

Hello,

we have already experimented with dcat at the hbz. This might be of
interest to Christopher and others thinking about describing open data
sets, see my post to this list several weeks ago:[1]

<quote>
I have finally documented in English our experiences with the Data
Catalog Vocabulary for describing open bibliographic data sets at
https://wiki1.hbz-nrw.de/display/SEM/Using+dcat+for+Open+Bibliographic+Data.
On this page you'll find some description examples, a documentation of
our general problems and our specific problems with dcat as well as
suggestions how to improve dcat.

These experiments were part of some thinking about the
conceptualization of an open bibliographic data infrastructure. Felix
and I published a paper on this some weeks ago, which unfortunately
only exists in German, see
http://www.hbz-nrw.de/dokumentencenter/produkte/lod/aktuell/pohl_ostrowski_2010_open-data-infrastruktur.pdf.
For now our work on this will stop. As soon as more libraries publish
their data under an open license we certainly will pick up these
thoughts...
</quote>

In my perception the work on the Data Catalog Vocabulary seems to
stand still for some time now which is a pity. There are people on
this list (Ed Summers and William Waites) who are involved in the work
on dcat: Do you share this perception? Perhaps we can stimulate a
reuptake of the work on dcat. I think a proper RDF vocabulary for
describing data sets is crucial for the development of Open Data.

Since publishing this another possible problem with dcat came up to
me: I wonder whether it is good that dcat primarily describes
_catatalogs_ as aggregation of records which describe data sets. I
believe that an approach which focuses on a vocabulary for describing
data sets in the first place would be better. Such a vocabulary is
easier to build, to understand and use and individual descriptions
could be aggregated ex post to build catalogs.

BTW, I am very much favouring an approach of describing decentralizied
entities - like data sets or organisations - in a DECENTRAL manner,
which means: I would like to describe the Open Data from the hbz at
ONE place on our web site, enrich it with RDFa and then provide
central registries like CKAN with the URL where they can harvest this
information. It is very uncomfortable and unneccessary in times of
Linked Data having to describe the same resources in different places.
E.g., momentarily I describe hbz Open Data in our wiki[2] and in CKAN
[3] and I was asked to describe the data in offenedaten.de[4] -  a
German CKAN installation - as well. (I was told that different CKAN
installations can't interchange data yet so that I'd have to provide
both installations with the same descriptions.) I don't want to do
this. I don't want to describe the same thing multiple times in
different places. I want to describe the data sets one-time, at best
on my web page and enable anybody else - by using RDFa - to harvest
it... As far as I know it was Mark Birbeck who was the first to choose
this approach for solving the problem he put as follows: "[H]ow could
they create a centralised web-site of information that the public
could search and access, when the source of that information could be
any government department database or any public sector web-site?"[5]

There's another project which should be taken into account in this
discussion which also develops a vocabulary for data sets - mainly
research data: DataCite[6].

<quote>
DataCite is an international consortium to
- establish easier access to scientific research data on the Internet
- increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable
contributions to the scientific record, and to
- support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and
re-purposed for future study.[7]
</quote>

In September they released the datacite metadata kernel - a set of 18
metadata elements for describing research data sets - and asked for
review.[8] I haven't had time to take a deeper look at it yet but I
believe that the different vocabularies for describing data sets
should be harmonized somehow.

In short, I think it is vital to develop vocabularies for describing
data sets which can be used in CKAN as well as on individual
institutional web sites. And I think that it is one of the greater
problems with CKAN that there is now standard way of describing a
dataset in a more granular manner than now. Thus I think it is vital
to develop vocabularies for describing data sets which can be used in
CKAN as well as in other registries or on one's web site. dcat and
datacite seem to be a good start, they just has to be taken to a
usable level...

As ever these all seem to come from the "what shall we provide?" school 
of thinking, rather than "what do people need?"

I really don't know what metadata would make a dataset easier to use, 
and repository managers are the wrong people to ask.

Who's consuming this data? Or not consuming it due to inadequate metadata?

Hello!

The Guardian just announced that they added ISBNs and Musicbrainz
GUIDs to their API:

http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/linked-data-open-platform
http://www.guardian.co.uk/open-platform/blog/references-in-api

Nice feature enabling Linked Data apps (BBC Music?) to draw in
Guardian content very easily. It is also a first step in the Linked
Data world from the Guardian, which is very good!

Best,
y

  You should look. I have not looked either because it's not an
  essential concern, but rumour has it that they require a DDC subject
  number and a DOI for every record. Neither of these technologies is
  free. We should resist this.

This is really great Adrian. Couple of minor suggestions:

1. Avoid putting explicit spaces in page names as they render as %20.
Suggest using '_' instead. E.g.

"Relevant_projects" rather than "Relevant projects" (which becomes
"Relevant%20projects"

2. Put wg related pages 'under' the wg/bibliography page (examples below)

I'd suggest these go under the wg page i.e. at:

http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography/members

I note a rename in moinmoin is very easy so we can almost do this is
one click if you're happy with this.

Ditto, ie. suggest

<http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography/etherpads>

I think this is great. Also feel free to add pages to openbiblio.net
for items that are less wiki-like and more 'website-like'.

Ok, I will do that in the future.

Ok, I didn't know how to do that (now I know). It is true that this
gives the wiki some structure. (So, MoinMoin can be used as kind of a
hierarchical wiki...)

I couldn't find out how to do the renaming. If you could do this, it
would be great. If it is possible for any user to rename I would be
happy to learn how it works.

Just did this:

Adrian: FYI you have to login then click 'rename' on right hand side.

Looks much better -- the page was getting pretty big before! ;-)

Message-ID: <CB73EF01104E804DADA257E0355FBD530EFE4B3334@shakespearenew.britac.ac.uk>

Announcing the launch of the NEW biab online service from the CBA!

http://www.biab.ac.uk

biab online - the primary research resource for British & Irish archaeology - has now launched a fully upgraded service. The underlying datamodel has been redesigned to bring the dataset more in line with FRBR and developing online bibliographic standards such as RDA.

This free online service now contains c.200,000 records on a huge range of subjects from Palaeolithic DNA to post-medieval housing, and from sources as wide-ranging as published books, journals and post-graduate theses. Powerful new search and browse facilities mean that the dataset can be interrogated far more closely - plus users can now create their own accounts and store their searches and retrieved results, building a reference bibliography as their research takes shape. The launch of the new service also brings with it an astonishing c.60,000 new references with the addition of not only over 5,000 new publication references but also over 55,000 grey literature references from England's Archaeological Investigations Project (AIP), including technical reports deposited by archaeological contractors in Historic Environment Records.

A new and improved interface means that users can search for the references they need, in many cases read abstracts that summarize the content and, where the publication is available online, click through to the source.

biab online is an essential tool for anybody carrying out archaeological research from:

- undergraduate essays to postdoctoral work
- HERs to archaeological contractors
- television screenwriters to archaeological scientists
- national organizations to local societies

biab online is a free service provided by the Council for British Archaeology and funded by all major heritage agencies in Britain and Ireland.


We are looking to frame terms of reference for open data status given that we are an abstracts & indexing service - if anyone has any advice on this please email me direct or to the list. Also, we are looking as a matter of urgency to implement DOI resolver facilities in some form for our users - again all advice extremely welcome!

Kind regards

This could be sensational. They do ISBNs. So far a few thousand. But with
the Guardian's help we could get a citizen bibliography off the ground.

*** Could we get an article in the Guardian outlining how it will work with
the Guardian and BL material? ***

I don't know the Guardian people well - I know there are people who do. It
would be great to get something going before RLUK.

Hi Peter,

I just checked. When a comment is made, the person that published the
article gets an email about it. The comment then has to be approved
before it is published. So for example, I just got an email because
your test comment was to an article I published.

Mark

Peter Murray-Rust <pm286 at cam.ac.uk> wrote in his blog http://wwmm.ch.cam.ac.uk/blogs/murrayrust/?p=2668 :

"Bibliography is the soul of scholarship. I thought that by collecting bibliography and turning it into an intelligent semantic resource then we would start a new era in the library."

Me too.  Its disappointing but understandable that many librarians dont want to assist the transition.
Perhaps someone on this list could suggest how to get the library community more engaged in this effort?

To pick another point from Peter's BLOG.  Peter quoted a correspondent who wrote:

"And just for the record,  distributed security in REST  is not trivial nor simple at all ... there are no well accepted solutions currently.
This might be the major obstacle in front of any REST approach aiming at distributed services, rather than single REST site, as most 
major commercial REST services these days. ....
Just sharing what we are struggling with for two years already, having tens of distributed REST services over Europe , 5 independent implementations in two languages, covering at least half of the functionality listed in your email."

What exactly is the "distributed security" problem here?
The BKN idea is to have a large number of distributed REST biblio sites,
each running an open webservice, each managing its own security, responsible for its own backups, and each offering open reusable biblio 
data with local write and world read.
Aggregator sites may develop, and these would have to manage their own security concerns, picking and choosing data from whatever 
data providers.  But the security issues involved in such a network seem local to me,  not distributed.  
Is there a distributed security problem with this model?   
Or only with a model which supposes some more complex interactions between webservices?
Peter, perhaps you could forward question to your correspondent?

Jim, this work is underway, at least on two fronts. One is that the  
W3C has an incubator group for linked library data [1] that will make  
some specific recommendations for how to move this forward. The other  
is that some of us in library-land have been writing, speaking, and  
doing. There are RDF representations for a number of library  
vocabularies [2] [3], I published two guides for the US library  
association [4] [5] (and will be speaking next month in Germany and  
England on the topic, as well as in Norway in January), and this week  
is the first of a series of 3 webinars done by the library association  
to provide continuing education in this area. We also did a one-day  
training session on linked data at the main US library meeting and  
will have an ongoing group meeting about linked data in libraries at  
those conferences twice a year. There are numerous efforts outside of  
the US which I am not as well versed in, but Germany has a Semantic  
Web in Libraries conference that is now an annual event, as I  
understand it. And, as you've seen, some libraries are beginning to  
publish their data in a linked data format.

So, what else should we be doing? :-)

What we lack at this point is applications, but of course they are  
harder to create than the data. Also, we depend on vendors to provide  
the applications that allow libraries to create data and provide user  
services. Analogous to other complex software, like word processing,  
this isn't something that you can just whip up but something you need  
to buy. And, guess what! the economy is in the toilet and no one has  
any money to buy new software. So that part is being slow, but I think  
we'll get there.

Creating Open Data. Nothing else works. Without Openness you are linked into
unmanageable contractual agreements

I am not sure that is true. Of course it depends what the applications are.
Software to manage a process - especially with security - is harder than
sofware than manages Open semantic web objects.

And that's a major part of the problem. The vendors control the users.
That's why we are creating an infrastructure of Open Source and Open Data
tools in chemistry - the Blue Obelisk.

I am not saying it's easy but until we reclaim our independence from vendors
we shall have second class solutions

It certianly can't be whipped up but it can be created outside the
commercial sector. Of course management has costs and management of
resources needs supported. But there is no reason why the world's libraries
shouldn't be based on open Source and it's actually one of the potentially
best areas to do so.

And, guess what! the economy is in the toilet and no one has any money to

So that's the best time to think about doing it a different way. We are
building the computational chemistry "library" of the future out of Open
Source and it could be done for other sectors as well.

I think Ross makes a really good point here. We're past the stage of the 
early adopters who will do it because it's a neat idea. One of the big 
ongoing issues of linked data is that it's always 'sold' to people in 
one of two ways;

1. It really benefits the rest of the community (why should I bother 
doing work for people beyond our own library, I'm already overworked and 
underpaid!)

2. Someone above you paygrade has decreed it thus (in which case what's 
the minimum I need to do to comply)

I think that take up could be improved if there were some (more, clear) 
benefits directly to the library & the library staff. What might be 
useful to gain uptake:

1. define some recommended patterns for how a library should publish 
semantic data so that it's more a case of filling in the blanks than 
training in a new field.

2. provide some excellent tools (for scholars, students, mobile devices, 
facet based searching, library management etc.) which can work with one 
or more of these standard patterns. Include open licenses and URI 
structures as part of these patterns.

At which point the community gets open, semantic data which is of value 
to all, but the local users & staff have got an immediate return on 
investment.

I'm attempting this strategy with my programme ontology -- for 
conferences & arts festivals. My goal is to get them all publishing RDF 
programmes and lists of speakers/acts etc and my plan is to provide a 
very simple XML file they can copy (eg. 
http://programme.ecs.soton.ac.uk/1.0/examples/overlaps.rdf ) which can 
be turned into slick HTML and iCal by free tools; 
http://programme.ecs.soton.ac.uk/tool.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Fprogramme.ecs.soton.ac.uk%2F1.0%2Fexamples%2Foverlaps.rdf 
it's slow work as it's unfunded and mostly done in my spare time, but 
it's beginning to get a little traction but the tools are still not 
killer apps. Yet.

The hardest part of all this is the 'Linked' in Linked Data. There's a 
whole bunch of entities which could be linked between bibliographies; 
people, publishers, aspects of a FRBR model (which I'm not convinced 
works with digital materials), events, places of publication, licensing, 
genres, formats, etc. In EPrints we go as far as 'minting' resolvable 
URIs for people, organisations, events, places, journals but makes no 
attempt to link them to items in the rest of the semantic web,  beyond 
the use of urn:issn:xxx and urn:isbn:xxx. Local administrators can 
modify the logic used to generate these URIs or even add triples (eg. on 
http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/cgi/export/eprint/18176/RDFN3/ecs-eprint-18176.n3?mimetype=text/plain 
notice the owl:sameAs attached to the author). I think linking these may 
be a job beyond the remit of most libraries and more likely to be 
handled by online services who analyse many sites and work out which 
entities are (probably) the same...

The real point about this discussion is whether we wish Bibliography and
related content, metacontent , services to be Open or vendor-controlled. The
analogy is between Ordnance Survey and OpenStreetMap. OS sells and rents
content and services. THEY control what is done. Library vendors sell and
rent content and services. They control what we can do. The open
semantification of bibliography is about freedom, noit technology. It's
clrear from these and other discussions that libraries and librarians don't
care about freedom of books, etc. and are more oriented towards reader
services supplied by vendors. (This is all academic anyway as shortly
vendors will be selling directly to students - we've seen the first signs of
this in tha last few days. There will be no need for libraries to negotiate
terms - all we require is purchasing officers).

I had hoped to find some feeling among libraraians that they cared about
this but I haven't seen any - I've blogged, tweeted, etc. and I know these
get around.

I have a lot of good things to say about Talis, but Talis represents the
vendors, not the readers or the public. Talis's role is selling systems to
libraries. There is no guarantee that any vendor will protect fundamental
rights. That's what the OKF is about.

That's what Open Bibliography is about. The way we are developing it anyone

No, the hardest is when the word OPEN is omitted. Because then you have to

I feel as a librarian that I have to reply to this discussion. However, I 
follow this list as an extremely interested observer and cannot claim to 
fully understand everything that is discussed here.

There *is* interest within the library community (as recent releases of 
data have demonstrated I think) but there is perhaps a lack of 
understanding. I believe that librarians do care enormously about freedom 
of information, freedom of books, that is my experience across the range of 
libraries and professional activity. So perhaps what it needs is a clear, 
basic (really basic) explanation of what is being asked and how librarians 
can get involved (in a blog post somewhere perhaps?) which I would then be 
more than happy to promote, re-tweet and talk about to the many librarians 
I know. I don't feel in a knowledgable enough position just now to do this 
myself. I'm already awaiting more details of the open bibliography 
community involvement project that Peter has already talked about and 
which, again, I'd be happy to promote (just wanted to see what it would 
involve before doing so).

I will return to interested lurking...

OK. Open is very important, but most people won't do extra work for the 
common good. I prefer carrots to sticks, but maybe appealing to 
librarians isn't the only approach...

It may be that individual libraries don't feel they will see the return 
on investment of the training in new techniques, retooling of data and 
risk of changing their licenses.

Someone pays for libraries, right? Mostly not the users.

Is it possible to come up with a simple and clear story to lobby with, 
lobby people much higher up the structure. Getting funding councils to 
require Open Access publication of work they fund was a great idea. Can 
something similar happen with libraries?

Excuse a rather naive question; but what types of libraries exist in the 
world? Each major type may require a different approach. I can think of;

Public Lending Libraries
National Archive Libraries
Personal Libraries (my bookshelf & harddrive)
University Libraries

Are archives of data (Flickr, Youtube) libraries?

</snip>

My own opinion is that most libraries are extremely bureaucratic places, and that the very concept of "time" in a library environment is much more akin to geologic eons ("You can't change that! That precise matter was discussed at a meeting between the Head of the Library and the Dean of the Faculty in 1965, and it was decided that...."). Comparing this attitude to our normal idea of time, and especially to the hyper-fast idea of time on the world wide web, where anything from 2 years ago (or less) may as well have come from the Assyrians, we can begin to understand the problems.

Also, I believe that matters have changed so much for libraries since the WWW, and that reference questions have declined drastically; libraries have already lost the science, technology and mathematics people, the social sciences are leaving, all that is left is the humanities, and now with the budget cuts, I don't know if the problem is that librarians don't care or if they are just terribly depressed, feel they have no control over anything, and prefer to look away.

I was personally hoping that open source and the entire open movement would be the key to excite the field of librarianship again, since I personally believe the open movement is exactly where librarianship belongs, but it hasn't seemed to happen. Libraries (as opposed to individual librarians) are highly conservative and consequently very slow to change. It seems that in the present time of decreasing budgets, even more conservative movements and a real retrenchment may be what is in store for us. I can only hope not.

Yet, if the field of librarianship were to get behind the open movement (and some libraries and librarians are, to be fair), it would be a tremendous advance. I guess this is a rather abstract statement though, and what is needed are some real prototypes where administrators can see the possibilities.

Hi Jonathan

this is very much what we're looking to do - the copyright is a legacy feature that will stay until we sort out exactly how to progress this for us. Which is why I asked in my original email if anyone had any advice for abstracts & indexing services re open data issues (if any). Library holdings are qualitatively different I think - and we had been moving forward with the understanding that online production for a&i followed the same principles of copyright/`ownership' as hard-copy production (ie the level of information we extract and produce doesn't infringe anything). I would just like to clarify the situation and get precedent if possible before we draft our statement. Otherwise, we're good to go with this I think

anybody know of any existing a&i services who have been through this already?

cheers

Isabel

So do I believe that. BUT they have to speak. This is an opportunity.

I have been involved in work with the library community and - despite my
somewhat abrasive approach - get asked to speak to library meetings from
time to time.

What is at issue is who is in charge of making content available - the
community (in which I see librarians playing an important role) or the
vendors. I won't name the vendors as they'll probably try to sue me.  But
vendors who supply content, who supply catalogues, library management
systems, ebooks, etc.). Here are some of the freedoms we have lost:
* freedom from DRMs (the BL DRMs all its interlibrary loans)
* freedom from renting. The libraries rent scholarly articles rather than
owning them
* freedom for fair use. We are besotted with copyright fud.
* freedom to use bibliography without infringing someone's claimed rights

We've lost our fundamental freedoms. Every time someone brings out a new
ebook we lose more freedoms.

I'm presenting a session to RLUK next month about "Democratization of
Knowledge" . I wanted this to be an interactive session based on the fact
that 3 million records from the BL are now Open. I think this is a wonderful
step forward. When I blog this, tweet it, etc I get silence. When I mention
this to librarians they think I'm wierd - why would anyone want open
bibliography. Why would anyone want the catalogue of the national library.

I am now unclear what I should say in this session. I'd like positive help.

One idea is that you and your colleagues meet with us physically and we
address the issues. If you can find 4 or 5 other like-minded souls we'll
meet in a pub and thrash the issues out. But I'd like the world to know what
our views are...

There are 250,000 people making open maps and a similar number cataloguing
galaxies. There's zillions of people who love books. If we can reach them we
can truly create Open Bibliography. (And, unfortunately, Open Library isn't
Open by OKF standards, so we have to start from near zero). The BL's data is
a tremndous place to start from.

I wasn't actually asking librarians to do extra work for the common good. I
was under the mistaken impression that there were interested in bibliography
and would show a professional effort which could be helpful to us.

No - some of it comes out of my grants. I don't begrudge this, but it would
be nice to see engagament.

I'm not a politician. I *am* trying this with UKPMC where I encounter
serious FUD. But I think there is so much experience in web democracy that
we can build this ourselves.
Example:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geograph has 10,000 members in UK and has taken
2 million photos of the country and meticulaously recorded these. That's an
average of 200 photos per member.

Analogue:
Open Bibliography could have 10,000 members and record - from the books -
the bibliography and produce 3 million records for the BL data. That's 300
books each. I expect you could photograph the NON_COPYRIGHT metadata with an
iPhone. Then I suspect it's a few minutes to enter each book. We'll produce
the tools.

Geograph took 5 years and is 78% complete. I suspect Open bibliography could
do the same in less. it's an ideal thing for people to do at home from their
own book collection.

I tried to get feedback from the librray community before the meeting - it's
all on my blog. Almost no feedback.

Silent interest is little use today.

Some hurried thought from the bus: 

Perhaps it would be interesting & useful to describe the role of the librarian in a future where bibliographic data is crowd-sourced from enthusiast volunteers. Sometimes it does seem as though we ask librarians to collude in the demise of their profession. This may not be the case, but it can appear so - after all, cataloguing is a large part of librarianship.

Peter: I think it's disingenuous to suggest librarians are disinterested in this issue. I realise you are trying to provoke a response - but by your own admission this does not seem to be working. Perhaps a different approach is required if we want librarians to engage. But, as you sometimes seem to hint, perhaps we really don't need them to....?

This comes down to a organisation/individual issue - if the bureaucratic
caution or pace is not supported by the action or inaction of
individuals within an organisation, then what causes it? Is it a few
members of higher rank putting on the brakes? Is it a general acceptance
by too many that this "is just how things are" rather than "this is how
things should be"?

Regardless, it is still not entirely accurate to lay the blame at the
feet of individuals - libraries act with an emergent behaviour dependant
on all the people who work within and alongside them. It's is not fair
to blame librarians, but it is fair to blame all librarians,
accountants, bureaucrats, lawyers, and academics for the actions of the
libraries.

I think that this has great validity as this skips over the one main
misunderstandings of open metadata - we wish to be legally free to
collaborate and share on a large scale, and the copynorms that the vast
majority of people operate under are legally debatable and would likely
be targetted if attempted at scale. (I won't say illegal as I feel
deeply that this information is simply that - just information.)

I think all this list knows of the oft cited reports on how open access
increases usage/citation (Tim Brody's and others) and it is easy to
theorise that increasing the discoverability of accessible material
should do the same. Google and other 'cross-domain' search engines being
a valid example of this - it is easy to forget how hard search was in
the past.

So what can we do? What can a service that held and worked on open
metadata look like?

There are two tested policies for hosting user-submitted content:
moderation and the YouTube-style 'takedowns'. With (human) moderation of
any kind, *you* are liable for any aberrant/illegal content. With a
permissive, reactive policy, the user is liable as long as you respond
to take-down notices and pick the battles you wish to fight.

I have seen that much of OpenLibrary's content mirrors Amazon metadata
for a given item - given the APIs that were available for both, I am not
surprised. Why Nielson (who supply most of the MD to Amazon for a fee)
hasn't pursued this, I can only theorise.

Does this imply that we are being too cautious? Maybe.

So why provide it as linked data? I don't think there is much of an
argument to provide it as linked data to a typical end-user, at least in
terms of the majority that libraries deal with day-in, day-out. They
lack the tools, the software and most importantly, don't care.

However, I think it is far easier to sell the idea of inter- and
intra-library 'authority services' in the manner that Jim's BKN and
other projects suggest. Linked data is fantastic for linking around
entities - people, publishers and so on.

However, it is a double-edged sword - it cuts through technical issues
of sharing this data, but can also cut through ego's just as fast as it
is also fantastic at showing the true quality of the data. (IMO There
seems also to be a reticence in the existing LoD community to encode
murky data - that is, potentially false, duplicate, biased or
conflicting data. I would argue that bias is present anytime anyone
chooses how to use a predicate or creates yet-another-new-class when an
existing one isn't felt to be quite right.)





So, if the above was tl;dr - I think that (per-organisation) authority
lists is a great first argument for linked data in libraries and
achievable as long as we don't forget the human dimension of the ego and
how to support it when messy data is inevitably published.

Sidestepping all of the sanctimonious patronizing towards libraries
(chemistry is not much of a high horse to look down from), to answer
Peter's original question about getting the data: DSpace has ways to
get data out.  Every DSpace instance has an OAI-PMH provider:

https://spectradspace.lib.imperial.ac.uk:8443/dspace-oai/request?verb=Identify

it's just that Imperial's seems to be broken.

DSpace also has an SRU plugin:

http://code.google.com/p/oclcsrwdspacelucene/

But that doesn't mean Imperial has installed it.

Maybe if they had a vendor to call for support...

But, seriously, it's disingenuous to brand me (Talis is a slightly
more complicated entity than you are painting) as a "representative of
the vendors".

It's not a zero-sum game:  you can have open source, open data and
commerce in the same conversation.  I am hardly a corporate shill, but
a diverse ecosystem would most likely be the most profitable for
everybody.

With my previous suggestion of providing great tools as a way of

a license...

My colleague Celine has summed up brilliantly the point of view of the 
average Librarian on this, some are potentially very interested in 
contributing to Open bibliography (besides the large chunks of data we've 
already spent a lot of effort creating) but still unsure as to what and how 
we can do, given the other constraints on our time. A few personal 
observations on why you may not get the response you want:

1) Some library workers will sadly be very suspicious of this effort, 
mainly because they see it as an encroachment upon their professional work. 
Would you ask a plumber to fix your pipes in his spare time? Would you even 
feel cheeky asking for his advice?

However many people get by very well doing their own plumbing. 

Given the advantages of presenting library data freely and outside of the 
catalogue interface this 'we know best' attitude is a real shame. The 
latest version of the Cambridge collective catalogue now has a crude 
tagging mechanism, importing data from LibraryThing. Even in its non-open 
imperfect form, the benefits it brings in extra access points and thus 
extra value are clearly a good thing. But some do not see this.

2) Librarians as a personality type are not generally known for being 
out-going and engaging folk. This is a horrible crass generalisation on my 
part, but may count for something here.

We exist in large beaurcaracies and have multiple competing voices to 
listen to, most often our direct employers. As I have said before here, we 
do not operate with the same freedoms as academics. (I'm currently on a 
fellowship programme so can actually put some time aside to even write this 
email).

Furthermore, it really is just a 9-5 day job for many people in the role, 
(especially those cataloguing, actually sometimes a hum-drum job imho) so 
out-of-work or even out-of-workflow interest will be more limited.

Many will not be able to see that by opening up some aspects of 
bibliographic work, they could perhaps find other more useful and helpful 
things to do with their time (and Peters' money). I would personally agree 
that there is something of a head-in-the-sand attitude at work here.

3) I'll echo Celines' point again, wider engagement from both sides between 
OKFN and libraries is needed on this issue, to highlight its importance and 
what is involved if we want to get our hands dirty. Rufus gave an excellent 
talk at the UL fairly recently on the benefits of open data. The recent 
video on Copyright Calculation is a great mechanism for this type of 
outreach.

It would be great to see an OKFN presence at one of the UK Mashed Libraries 
events:

http://www.mashedlibrary.com/

You will reach a very different type of Librarian there, and also have fun. 
Open mapping in particular has been very well covered in the past. 
Ultimately, however, if Librarians do not want to contribute, it is as has 
been siad not stricly required.

4) Many Librarians are slowly trying to chip away at their own instituions 
attitudes from within regarding this. In the interests of professionalism, 
they will be doing it quietly, internally and within the rules, mechanisms 
and command structure of their institution.

If it works, it will not happen as quickly or as effectively as you would 
like. James Weinheimer's description of the general attitude to change is 
spot-on.

There is still unquestionably a vast gulf between what we can offer and 
what you would like. For traditional academic libraries to move 
institutionally in the direction you want, a lot of effort and grit would 
be required.

5) Sadly, Librarians may not be the best people to even do this, or at 
least the more technical aspects. As a whole, the professions' skill-set 
has not generally kept apace with the networked environment. I've written 
more on it here (http://communities.cilip.org.uk/forums/t/11967.aspx). 
Selling even the idea of Linked Data is frankly a challenge. To perform the 
potential roles we could in supporting research, a different type of 
individual may be required.


Meanwhile, to bring it home, here is another freedom we are loosing:

So no real answers.

However, a service like this doesn't mean that you can reuse it for
anything other than personal use. I am part of a ongoing conversation
with UKPMC where they stated that they could not openly allow large
scale reuse of their OAIPMH provided metadata. They said they could for
their 'OA subset', but not for any of the others as they have
contractual obligations to their metadata suppliers.

Firstly many thanks for this discussion (I have changed the title) - I shall
take a sort of back seat. When there is no discussion it can be easy to
offend and I don't wish to set off flame wars here. I would hope that out of
this might come some concrete suggestions for community action. I appreciate
the sensitivities but the world is running out of time.

The difference between something like OL and BL is that OL doesn't own  
the data it hosts, and therefore can only be silent on rights. (AFter  
all of the lawyerly gobbledy-gook, that's what the Archive's terms of  
use basically says.) This will be the case for anyone who harvests and  
combines data. It's a dilemma, but I don't know of a solution (beyond  
carrying rights data in every record, which of course then brings up  
the provenance-at-the-element-level problem). What this means is that  
when OL ingests the BL data, that data's rights are still defined by  
BL, not by OL, which has no right to declare rights over BL data. The  
same will be true when the BL data joins the linked data cloud -- it  
becomes open by a kind of default, but mainly because the cloud  
doesn't have a way to recognize rights. OL data is also in the cloud  
under that same status.

That said, OL does not accept metadata from anyone who wishes to  
assert any restrictions on use -- this is both a philosophical and a  
practical issue: OL has no way to convey nor enforce any kind of  
restriction, and Brewster is totally dedicated to openness.

The only reason I mentioned OL was that we in OKF cannot take data from OL
and pronounce it OKD-Open.

Which comes down to the academics signing less restrictive licenses on
their content.  Of course, the metadata should still be open (shy of
abstract, perhaps) for harvesting: no publisher has the rights to the
citation data.

I understand your licensing poison pill problem.  It's a mess.  What I
don't feel is legitimate is holding the library as scapegoat and
responsible for "fixing" the problem.  There are lots of actors in
this ensemble piece and it will take all of them working in concert to
fix it, because without buy-in from all the parties involved, we have
to work in vacuums.

UKOLN (my organisation) is organising the next Mashed Library event which happens to be this week (Oct 29th)

http://blogs.ukoln.ac.uk/mashspa/2010/08/17/theevent/

I'm not sure I understand the reference to "a very different type of Librarian" but there certainly will be some excellent librarian folk, mixing with developers who are interested in developing with library services and data. I recommend these events highly - there are a couple of places left for Friday although the signup sheet seems to have been taken down - if anyone else wants to come just email Julian Cheal at UKOLN (j.cheal at ukoln.ac.uk).

> 5) Sadly, Librarians may not be the best people to even do this, or at least the more technical aspects. As a whole, the professions' skill-set has not generally kept apace with the networked environment. I've written more on it here (http://communities.cilip.org.uk/forums/t/11967.aspx). Selling even the idea of Linked Data is frankly a challenge. To perform the potential roles we could in supporting research, a different type of individual may be required.

I plan to blog about this in more detail shortly, but I thought I's mention that I have just got back from a week away devoted to discussions about metadata at DCMI's annual conference and a meeting of the W3C incubator group on library linked data.

The DCMI conference was somewhat different than some previous conferences in that a significant proportion of delegates were both new to this 'community' and were 'practitioners'. They had come to the conference, drawn by the promise of a chance to learn, especially, about the application of LD to metadata.

I spent a whole day before the DCMI conference sitting in on four excellent tutorials, aimed at information professionals who wanted to get a handle on linked-data. In all four tutorials I noticed a tendency to (reasonably enough in this case) skip over the 'why' of linked data, and to jump to the 'how'. The 'why', whenever it was discussed, was generally of the usual 'just look at how brilliant this could be if everyone did it' variety. This is the sort of approach which nearly landed TBL et. al. huge investment from the previous government - but it can often lack persuasion for individual practitioners. Frankly, there is much in the rhetoric of linked data which leaves me unpersuaded, but I'm happily in a position where I have a remit to takes chances on things. This latter point is really important. I'm afraid that I just don't buy into any of the attempts to characterise librarians as being different to people in other professions. Librarians are professionals and I'm glad that they generally act professionally. Those of us who are not professional librarians have more freedom to take chances on promising technologies and approaches. Another way of putting it might be to say that the fact that academics/researchers appear to be able to think and act more freely than librarians is a feature of our society, not a bug.

What this means is that your definition of OKD-Open requires you to  
only take in data directly from the rights owner. In a data cloud  
environment, I'm not sure that this is sustainable. Provenance is  
going to break down very quickly, especially when we deal in  
"statements" rather than "records". This is, of course, why there is a  
W3C group looking at provenance.

I don't know how we solve this dilemma, but to me this puts OKD-Open  
in a "pre-cloud" position -- which is not a bad thing. Essentially a  
set of self-declared open data that people can select from. In the  
strict definition of that, very little of the data in OL comes from  
such a pre-cloud repository with rights attached, and therefore rights  
are mostly undeclared.  It's more of a "free the data" approach, as  
opposed to "this data is free/open."

Is there any chance of having bibligraphic metadata being explicitly 
legally declared as always fair use? If you do that the problem goes away...

In the US that can only be the result of a court case -- a long,  
expensive court case. That's because of the particular mechanism of  
the US "fair use" provision. For countries with "fair dealing" and  
other more explicit declarations, I presume it is a legislative  
matter. It would be great if something could happen at an EU level,  
but I can't imagine the effort that would take.

I do agree - my personal opinion is that copyright law doesn't apply to
the simple identifying fields in the PubMed metadata. (Abstracts, etc
are arguably covered under fair dealing, and there is a norm around
indexing them anyhow) However, the only lawsuits I know of are those of
the search engine reuse, and they are typically ruled on with US law.

eg http://news.cnet.com/2100-1030_3-6041724.html 

(Also, forgot to link to Google's Safe harbour defence for YouTube
earlier, is worth reading, if only for what constitutes a 'Safe
Harbour'd service provider... in the US at least.
http://www.google.com/press/pdf/msj_decision.pdf [30pg PDF])

The next bogeyman is the sui generis database law - which I really don't
think applies to the dataset that strongly either but unfortunately, I
do think there is a case here because some agent, somewhere, decides
which journals are aggregated in PubMed and which aren't. This is why we
were pursuing UKPMC to sign off on this or at least get a letter of
agreement that they won't 'protect' their database rights.

I wouldn't say that this puts the OKD effort on a timeline, from legacy
to 'cloud' - we are looking for datasets that have yet to publish
openly. 

I don't think that per-triple provenance solves current problems - there
are many much much bigger fish to fry. The problem it would solve is to
ascertain provenance for triples from joined datasets. A quad store (or
greater) index would let you straightforwardly query this information
out. 

We can certainly attribute, provide provenance and characterise the
named graphs, the 'documents' that contain the data and a quad store
would provide the additional SPARQL keywords of FROM and GRAPH with
which to augment the queries.

The bigger problem is getting data as PDDL, CC0 or similar licence so
that you can merge datasets for more than just personal inspection - at
least in the EU.

Sorry; that was unclear. I meant positionally/structurally, not

That's correct. The other critical thing is that the data gets stamped as
open. Then the Open licence travels down the chain.

I am less hung up about the provenance explosion than some people. In
bioscience there is no explicit licence on the genome, structome, etc but
it's all used as if it were Open and everyone knows this. It works. The
community norm is that biodata on the data sites is effectively open. The
only thing that they worry about is DOS.

When we work with early adopter publishers - such as BMC - then the approach
is to label the data as Open. I agree that someone may take these pixels
from a frog image and overlay them on this gel and annotate them with that
graph. The original authors will not chase the community through the chain
and claim owenership of the frog's nose. If the data are used to make a
scientific claim and they are seminal to the paper then they will need to be
included.

the risks of being sued for re-using a scientists work without cascading
attribution are minimal compared to the risk of being killed by
beta-naphthylamine, retroviruses, etc.

People use my data. If it matters to their argument they quote me. If it's
in a myriad of places they don't and I don't expect it. If I use an Open
bibliography I'll probbaly quote it generally - e.g. references were
obtained from Wikipedia... etc.

Just a heads-up that openbiblio.net started to get battered by spammers
last night, and so this morning I've switched on the reCaptcha plugin to
attempt to stem the flow of spam comments.

Great! We should also *definitely* retheme the blog at some point! ;-)

Sorry to hear that, but I doubt it was disabled users, so don't give
them all the blowback.  As soon as possible, please switch to other
tools which don't insult and discriminate against disabled humans.
The "re" in "reCaptcha" should be taken as short for "replace ASAP"!

I find blogspam.net, shared blacklisting and collaborative moderation
works well to stop most comment spam, but the exact mix/methods vary
from site to site.

Hope you get it under control soon,

Just to follow this up: it would be *amazing* if LT would be willing
to release a dump of its data under CC-BY or equivalent (e.g. ODC
Attribution license for data [1])!

What do you think?

Excellent news! ;-)

So I guess this could be broken down into two parts:

  (i) What rights do you hold? (rights clearance / provenance tracking
for data from third parties)
  (ii) How do you license the material that you have rights in (or
that you have clearance to license)?

It would be great to from others involved in indexing any experiences
in relation to (i).

In relation to (ii) the main thing is to use an open license:

This is really exciting -- please keep us posted on what happens!

All the best,

Jonathan

Which is why I asked in my original email if anyone had any advice for abstracts & indexing services re open data issues (if any). Library holdings are qualitatively different I think - and we had been moving forward with the understanding that online production for a&i followed the same principles of copyright/`ownership' as hard-copy production (ie the level of information we extract and produce doesn't infringe anything). I would just like to clarify the situation and get precedent if possible before we draft our statement. Otherwise, we're good to go with this I think

Amazing! Thanks Tim! Do you have URLs for the last 3? We'd love to add
them to CKAN, e.g. at:

Thanks for the post, Tim. Such news are always good since until now we
are often asked: "Why release MARC or MAB which nobody can't really
use?"[1]
