Hello,

the virtual meeting should happen today as it's the first Tuesday of
the month. But as I haven't sent out a reminder early enough and will
also have problems to host the meeting today, I propose postponing it
to next week (Tuesday , March 12th, 16:00 UTC). Anybody who is willing
to attend, please add your name to the etherpad along with topics
you'd like to discuss:

 @Karen: Will you be around to describe the initial efforts at Open
Library to build a community around OL?

All the best
Adrian

Message-ID: <CAJr+OEyVqqy5_xCiMXkyd9Pvk_ZLOk+xn2v0H=3PtxZkBiGYzg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear lists,

The Open Knowledge Foundation is organising a special Crowdcrafting Hackday
at the Centre for Creative Collaboration in London on Saturday 16th March
from 10:00 to 17:00 (GMT) in collaboration with the Citizen Cyberscience
Center and Citizen Cyberlab.

The overall aim will be to develop micro-tasking apps for Science &
Humanities applications. We will have several experts there on the day
representing http://www.epicollect.net/ (Imperial College London) as well
as the lead developer of Crowdcrafting.org himself - Daniel Lombra?a
Gonz?lez (Citizen Cyberscience Center). An opportunity not to be missed!

Participants are welcome to either join-in with a project development on
the day, or bring their own app idea/proposal (but if the latter please do
get in contact with us beforehand so we can better accommodate this).

More info here: http://okfn.org/events/science-hackday-march-2013/

Event sign-up (required) here:

	2013
Message-ID: <20130306101627.GA21074@openlib.org>


  OAI8, the 8th Workshop on Innovations in Scholarly Communication will
  be held in Geneva, Switzerland, from Wednesday 19th to Friday 21st
  June 2013. Program details, registration and the call for posters are
  now available at https://indico.cern.ch/event/oai8. It is
  possible to register for a part or all of the programme.
  
  You are invited to submit a description in the form of a short
  abstract if you wish to bring a poster to the workshop giving
  details of your project. The poster should be of interest to OAI8
  participants and directly related to the general themes of the
  workshop.
  
  Posters will be displayed in the Uni Mail main hall and an extended
  coffee break will take place on Thursday 20 June 2013. This will
  give attendees the chance to view these and discuss them with the
  author. Attendees will also have the opportunity to vote for the
  poster which delivers the most impact. Posters should be A0 in size
  (841 x 1189 mm) for portrait or A1 (594 x 841 mm) for landscape.
  Any special equipment requests should be addressed to the workshop
  organisers when a poster has been accepted.
  
  If your poster is accepted you should still register for the
  workshop as normal and you will be expected to pay your own
  expenses. Owing to the large demand on accommodation, we advise you
  to register early - you may cancel your registration later if your
  submission is not successful.
  
  Poster abstracts can be submitted until 1 April 2013 after a quick
  registration process (different from the conference
  registration). Decisions will be made on an ongoing basis (and no
  later than the end April) and communicated to the submitters.
  
  The poster submission form is available at
  https://indico.cern.ch/abstractSubmission.py?confId=211600
  
  The committee looks forward to welcoming you to Geneva.

  For the OAI8 Organising Committee with cheers,

	deadline and student funding
Message-ID: <CAFvquW_56nOeQYkx3LFxHeqm6XkvYcZPmG7x=mMtFZ_ho4pA-A@mail.gmail.com>

Apologies for cross-posting

We are pleased to announce that a small amount of money for student travel
is available for the meeting, which will be held on April 11th in the
Informatics Forum, University of Edinburgh.

We also ask anyone intending to attend the meeting to register by *March
31st*, to allow us to finalise catering.

Registration and information about applying for student funding can be
found on the event website: http://dream.inf.ed.ac.uk
/events/ukont-13/2013_workshop_program.html.

The theme of this meeting is *to understand how ontology development and
application are being used to address problems* in the UK. Amongst other
areas of interest, there will be a particular focus on creating and using *open
data*. The program and audience is intentionally very diverse; the aim is
to cover areas from many disciplines. We are particularly interested in
bringing together those creating and developing the technology with those
using the technology in industry, government and public organisations.

There will be 18 short talks from leading academics, and practitioners from
major organisations and government, as well as a demo session and a
networking session.  The programme is given below.

We hope to see many of you in Edinburgh in April.  Please forward this
email to any individuals and mailing lists you think it might be of
interest to.

Many thanks,
Fiona

	March 2013)
Message-ID: <CAP884ExQjuYdX1UZzebkvJeB7kXt1P+HJx=7Nvu2eSY9UZPPYw@mail.gmail.com>

**** Excuse the cross-posting ****

Dear Colleagues:

This is a final reminder that the deadline to submit your paper, project
report, or poster for DC-2013 in Lisbon in rapidly approaching -- 29 March
2013.

======================================================
Call for Papers: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2013/cfp
Conference Website: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2013
Conference Dates: 2-6 September 2013
======================================================

The DC-2013 conference theme is "Linking to the Future":

"DC-2013 will explore questions regarding the persistence, maintenance, and
preservation of metadata and descriptive vocabularies. The need for stable
representations and descriptions spans all sectors including cultural
heritage and scientific data, eGovernment, finance and commerce. Thus, the
maintenance and management of metadata is essential to address the long
term availability of information of legal, cultural and economic value.  On
the web, data -- and especially descriptive vocabularies -- can change or
vanish from one moment to the next. Nonetheless, the web increasingly forms
the ecosystem for our vocabularies and our data. DC-2013 will bring
together in Lisbon the community of metadata scholars and practitioners to
engage in the exchange of knowledge and best practices in developing a
sustainable metadata ecosystem."

Beyond the conference theme, DCMI welcomes submissions of papers, project
reports and posters addressing the broad array of topics impacting metadata
research, design, and practice in domain and cross-domain contexts. Such
contexts include, but are not limited to, corporations, cultural memory
institutions, education, government, scientific fields, recordkeeping,
preservation, curation, institutional repositories, and publishing.

======================================================
DC-2013 in Lisbon will be collocated, and run simultaneously with,
iPRES-2013 offering delegates the opportunity to attend sessions of both
conferences and to build bridges between these synergistic groups.
 "Linking to the Future" demands attention to preservation and linkages to
the past.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Call for Comments: Mapping from Dublin Core to
	W3C PROV ontology
Message-ID: <CAP884ExtO++YMw91t5TBb2XAqYjju1Og9C-kQ8Ei83Tevch+2A@mail.gmail.com>

The DCMI Metadata Provenance Task Group [1] is collaborating with the W3C
Provenance Working Group [2] on a mapping from Dublin Core terms to the PROV
provenance ontology [3], currently a W3C Proposed Recommendation.  More
precisely, the document describes a partial mapping from DCMI Metadata Terms
[4] to the PROV-O OWL2 ontology [5] -- a set of classes and properties
usable
for representing and interchanging information about provenance. Numerous
terms
in the DCMI vocabulary provide information about the provenance of a
resource.
Translating these terms into PROV relates this information explicitly to the
W3C provenance model.

The mapping is currently a W3C Working Draft. The final state of the
document
will be that of a W3C Note, to be published as part of a suite of documents
in
support of a W3C Recommendation for provenance interchange [6].

DCMI would like to point to the W3C Note as a DCMI Recommended Resource and
therefore encourages the Dublin Core community to provide feedback and take
part in the finalization of the mapping.

The deadline for all comments is 7 April 2013.  We recommend that comments
be
provided directly to the public W3C list for comments:
public-prov-comments at w3.org [7], ideally with a Cc: to DCMI's dc-provenance
list [8].  Comments sent only to the dc-provenance list will be summarized
on
the W3C list and addressed, and discussions on the W3C list will be
summarized
back on the dc-provenance list when appropriate.

	education
Message-ID: <CAN+1nMwhYr=P0DshcnALRo-S5D+ttLN3Cnp_EGyVevORmxsXfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

The LinkedUp project is very pleased to announce the launch of the
LinkedUp challenge [1]. This is a series of three competitions (Veni,
Vidi, and Vici) promoting the innovative use of linked and open data
in an educational context.

The LinkedUp team invites anyone, from researchers and students, to
developers and businesses, to join the first 'Veni' competition [2].
You can participate by building prototypes, demos and innovative tools
that exploit, use, integrate or analyse large scale web data for
educational use.

Some very attractive prizes are only one reason to join and
participate [3] in the challenge. It is also a great opportunity to
work with a large, documented repository of linked datasets [4] that
the LinkedUp team is putting together. The consortium is also able to
offer dedicated access to so far non-public resources. The challenge
allows participants to showcase their ideas and solutions to a wide
community of researchers and practitioners. For businesses as well as
researchers, this will be a great opportunity to present their company
and enhance their network. For people working in academia, the
challenge will provide a wealth of material and opportunities for
experiments and publications.

While the LinkedUp team already identified and connected many
educational and non-educational resources to work with, participants
can also use and connect their own material or other data sources.
Anyone is free to showcase their creativity and solutions as long as
the application is relevant to education in the broadest sense of the
word. There are also some high profile use cases of established
organisations made available [5] that can serve as inspiration for
innovative applications. Join today!

Message-ID: <CAJjMrEPG8Zs9K5-mn0G6Of2u4pneyvBr0Uc2J6JWs++wk+K6nQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What is a good property to use for linking a resource to web pages
related to it?

In this case [a resource == a digital object repository object] but a
similar property may also be useful for bibliographic descriptions,
authority records, etc.

The property would be very generic as there's almost no "semantics" /
restriction on what the object of this relation can be.

Best candidates so far:
a) rdfs:seeAlso
b) foaf:page

What would you suggest?

Thanks,
Uldis

foaf:page or foaf:homepage (depending upon the relationship) are commonly used.

rdfs:seeAlso (and similarly foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf) should IM(NS)O really only be used for URLs where you can get more RDF back.

Can you explain the reasoning?  foaf:page, foaf:homepage, and
foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf all have identical ranges.

*************

*Joint OpenAIRE/LIBER Workshop : ?Dealing with Data: What?s the Role for
the Library?. 28 May, Gent, Belgium* Registration now open. This is a
pre-ELAG workshop.**

In the same week that the Research Data Alliance Plenary identified that
skill-sets for research data management are in short supply, it seems
timely to announce a workshop to explore where the library and research
institution sit in relation to supporting research data management, and
what future expectations for libraries might be.****

The library and research institution are having to understand their role
within this changing environment, and define the necessary support
mechanisms. OpenAIRE supports a range of stakeholders, namely librarians
and researchers in depositing, searching as well as linking research
output. LIBER supports libraries in making the transformation and acquiring
an active role in evolving areas such as research data management and
scientific information infrastructures.****

Expert speakers will cover issues such as the data life-cycle, data
citation, data publication, tools, and how research institutions can
support their researchers in data management. In addition, a number of
scientists will present their views on how  they  use, share, and link
research data within different domains. The day will close with a panel
session, supported by members of the LIBER Steering Committee ?Scholarly
Communication and Research Infrastructure? which will explore future
skill-sets for librarians.****

	2013 for DC-2013 in Lisbon
Message-ID: <CAP884Ey6k-Jr=PyoEQK4vMNXgdYkaH9+SCj_TDef_XrWHVvR_Q@mail.gmail.com>

**** Excuse the cross-posting ****

Dear Colleagues:

The submission deadline has been EXTENDED TO 5 APRIL 2013 for papers,
project reports, and posters for DC-2013 in Lisbon.

======================================================
Call for Papers: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2013/cfp
Conference Website: http://purl.org/dcevents/dc-2013
Conference Dates: 2-6 September 2013
======================================================

The DC-2013 conference theme is "Linking to the Future":

"DC-2013 will explore questions regarding the persistence, maintenance, and
preservation of metadata and descriptive vocabularies. The need for stable
representations and descriptions spans all sectors including cultural
heritage and scientific data, eGovernment, finance and commerce. Thus, the
maintenance and management of metadata is essential to address the long
term availability of information of legal, cultural and economic value.  On
the web, data -- and especially descriptive vocabularies -- can change or
vanish from one moment to the next. Nonetheless, the web increasingly forms
the ecosystem for our vocabularies and our data. DC-2013 will bring
together in Lisbon the community of metadata scholars and practitioners to
engage in the exchange of knowledge and best practices in developing a
sustainable metadata ecosystem."

Beyond the conference theme, DCMI welcomes submissions of papers, project
reports and posters addressing the broad array of topics impacting metadata
research, design, and practice in domain and cross-domain contexts. Such
contexts include, but are not limited to, corporations, cultural memory
institutions, education, government, scientific fields, recordkeeping,
preservation, curation, institutional repositories, and publishing.

======================================================
DC-2013 in Lisbon will be collocated, and run simultaneously with,
iPRES-2013 offering delegates the opportunity to attend sessions of both
conferences and to build bridges between these synergistic groups.
 "Linking to the Future" demands attention to preservation and linkages to
the past.

Thanks to everyone for suggestions!

One of the FOAF properties (foaf:page, foaf:focus,
foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf) it is then.

I was hoping to find a matching property in ontologies for
representing bibliographic data (bibo, DC, EDM, ...) but no success
there. Also considered rdfs:seeAlso, but it is mostly used for linking
to related RDF data.

Hi Uldis,

A bit late, but if you're mentioning EDM....

In fact EDM has a generic property called edm:hasView that can be used to relate a cultural object to any web resource that can be considered to offer some representation of it (a landing HTML page, a jpg, etc).
But the link would be indirect: there must be an ORE aggregation standing between the object and the web resource:

:anAggregation edm:aggregatedCHO [Your object] ;
                edm:hasView [Your page].

Perhaps that's not what you're after.

Best,

Antoine
