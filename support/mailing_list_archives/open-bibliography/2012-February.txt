This is brilliant Adrian -- and big well done to BNE!

We should boot a dataset on the DataHub for this and add to the
Biblographic data group <http://thedatahub.org/group/bibliographic>

That's awesome, Adrian.  I don't suppose that there's any English
language documentation on the DNB data model?  Sadly, my German is
pretty much non-existent.

For example, the "related persons" to Bertolt Brecht
http://d-nb.info/gnd/118514768/about/html appear to be encoded with a
rich set of relationships (gnd:functionOfThePerson) including not only
1st wife, 2nd wife, son, etc, but also long-term mistress, lover, etc.
 Is there a standard list somewhere that this set of relationship
roles is drawn from is it just free form text entered by the
cataloger?

It's really great to see the national libraries of the world coming on
board with support of open data.  Keep up the great work!

Message-ID: <CAE9vqEHeB0p9PUAC8tKGByoy10F9X0AXR8kq2qVjk6Z6Rh8rRw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to wrap my head around how BibSoup/BibServer works in the
greater ecosystem of bibliographic data.

In my perfect world, I'd never have to enter any information which is
not unique to me.  Books, authors, journals, articles, author
affiliations would all be magically known to the system and all I'd
need to add would be my own special value.  Reading list?  Just pick
the books to be included on the list.  Annotated bibliography?  Pick
the journal articles and add my comments or category tags of whatever
other type of annotation I like.  Reference list? Pick any CSL
template and book list and get my reference list generated in the
appropriate format to include in my publication.

Recognizing that this nirvana is a long way off and being willing to
help get there, I realize that I'm going to have to enter the data if
someone else hasn't already, but I'd like others to benefit from that
work and, conversely, be able to reuse the work that they've done to
save myself effort.  I know that some of my "data entry" will actually
be converting existing resources that I have into a usable form rather
than sitting down at the keyboard and retyping things.

Control of my work is important, so I'd like to be able to choose how
much, if any, of my annotations, lists, data entry, etc gets shared
(or is visible) to others.

What space, if any, does BibSoup/BibServer occupy in this world?  If
Jim Pitman has a public reading list and I have a reading list, can I
easily create a merged reading list with the books from both?  If
Jim's bibliography and my bibliography have a different list of
authors for a journal article, is there a collaboration mechanism
other than email for coming to agreement, if we both desire, on the
correct set of authors and updating the bibliographic database with
the results of that agreement?

Perhaps it would be illustrative to compare and contrast with other
existing widely known services and tools such as Zotero, Mendeley,
CiteUlike, and the venerable emacs/Bibtex/LaTex.  What is better,
worse, or just different?  Which sets of things are alternatives to
each other and which complement each other?  What are the things which
make BibSoup/BibServer unique?

Of course, if this is already laid out in detail somewhere on a web
page, just point me there.

There's already a DataHub package for this, see
<http://thedatahub.org/dataset/datos-bne-es>. The package is already
added to the bibliography and the lld group.

There doesn't seem to be a data dump available yet. I've asked about
it but haven't gotten an answer. Perhaps it's best people ask again
when they want to do something with the data (add it to BibServer
etc.).

All the best

Lots of important questions here. Following is my take on these issues.
Little of this is laid out in detail anywhere on a web page. But Naomi
has recently started work on pulling these sorts of materials together.

My long term goal also.

Also my view.

Yes.  Delicious manages this issue well. You can bookmark and annotate
a website, and then make this public or private. But delicious has only a
few fields: url/title/notes/tags. A lot can be done just with these fields.
If you replace the notes field by something comparable to a bibtex entry,
and have slightly more structured tags then something that incorporated the
best features of delicious and current bibsoup should serve these requirements.
I have been working on components of this, managing the bookmarking and tagging,
but the permissions/privacy issue remains challenging. I think the right data model
is something like the current BibJSON model for a record, with a record-specific  or in some 
cases field-specific tag which indicates the level of privacy.
I dont think it is useful fo have privacy indicators for basic public domain metadata.
I do think it is useful fo have privacy indicators at the record level, and within records
for some annotation fields. This is a feature request for BibJSON/BibServer.

> What space, if any, does BibSoup/BibServer occupy in this world?  

I think they are a major step towards realizing the goals indicated above.

I can, currently, with simple python code operating over BibJSON lists. This is not
yet available as a feature in BibServer, but it could fairly easily be.
Another feature request.

This is a mixed socio/technical question.
I have dealt with this issue for many thousands of instance records  by now, and have a 
fairly clear view of how it should be handled, at least technically, and some idea of the 
social side.
You have your record in BibJSON, I have mine. They differ. Simple python code allows the
two records to be compared. Trivial differences can be ignored, according to some normalization
convention. Substantial differences can be  treated field by field.
For quick applications, a hybrid record is machine-created by indicating in a config file for each
field what source is to be preferred, and ignoring the other field.
For more serious applications, like creation of an authoritative personal bibliography of a
deceased author, an editor looks at the two fields and makes a judgement, to take one or the other or do a hand-edited merge. I have primitive code and UIs for all these tasks.
Simple merging code is easy. Providing adequate UIs is hard. This sort of task can also potentially be crowdsourced, but the programming for that is beyond my current capabilities.
Now, when the merged record is created, there is the question of who owns or controls it,
committing it back to a database, etc. My view is that various biblio agents should be responsible for the cleanliness of their own biblio stores, hence responsible for what they write to those
stores. If you create a hybrid record and include it in your collection, that is up to you.
The hybrid record can also be created on the fly, stored in an index, and that could be done
by any particular BibServer instance, according to editorial policy governing that instance.
I dont think we know the answer to how best to manage the governance and quality control of
such operations. But we do now have at least primitive tools to perform them.

Excellent suggestion, and I would be glad to contribute to a wiki or other 
collaborative document space to respond to this. Naomi or Mark, could you
suggest how to organize a community response to these questions?
My own way would be to start in a Google Doc, which I would be glad to initiate,
but before doing that let us see what Naomi and Mark suggest.

Many thanks for the questions/suggestions.

Regarding person relationships see page 19 of the documentation. The
RDF data certainly is less specific than the the underlying data.
Family relationships seem to be explicitely encoded but for other
kinds of relationships only the general rdaRelGr2:relatedPersonPerson
is used.

To get a feeling for the underlying data take a look at
<http://gso.gbv.de/DB=2.1/PPNSET?PPN=133840107/SET=6/TTL=1/PRS=PP/NXT>
(That's the corresponding authority record in the GBV union catalog in
Pica+ format.)

I don't know whether there is a controlled vocabulary behind this
practice of typing a relationship but I guess there isn't. (Any people
familiar with German cataloging on this list?) But there will at least
be a common practice for this.

All the best
Adrian

Based on Tom's "Perfect World"... Medeley fulfills a large part of his wish
list already:

1. Has iPhone and iPad support. A Desktop version. A Web version.
2. Their Web importer already supports importing citations from just about
EVERYONE already...see here: http://www.mendeley.com/import/ as well as
COinS and metatags.
3. Sharing of annotations.
4. Group collaboration. (the level of collaboration differs between Paid
and Free however, I think.)
5. An Open Web API (just like Zotero has).
6. Soon to have Library Systems support for the major systems used
http://www.mendeley.com/blog/academic-features/announcing-the-mendeley-institutional-edition-powered-by-swets/#more-43450
7. Also soon to have Federated searching across external databases,
including those endorsing universities http://www.mendeley.com/endorsements/
7. It's FREE for up to 1GB for your own papers storage.

Some people care about the difference between a print version of a
scientific paper and the electronic. Others regard them as the same object.
But given that, Tom's vision is close to mine

we can reasonably envision services that provide much of this. So (real
examples)
* I want to find all the details of my Penguin books. Penguin is a British
company so I expect to find them in the OKD-compliant British National
Bibliography. Mark is getting this installed RSN. Then I can simply search
for publisher=penguin, title="heavy weather" author="wodehouse". As all the
national bibliographies come on line this will be a fantastic resource
* I want to find all papers on malaria. I search medline with all the
keywords (malaria, plasmodium, etc.) Medline has 70,000. Mark/.we are
setting up a bibserver/bibsoup for the OKF open-access group. There are 50
papers per week which the malaria community captures. We can update the
bibserver weekly

The areas that will be more difficult are:
* journal articles outside the mainstream of biomedical , maths, stats,
compsci, physics, economics
* books predating the national bibliographies (I think BNB goes back about
60 years??)
* grey literature (magazines, newspapers, reports, etc.)
* theses (some countries are good, others are not good)

I am also guessing that major providers like Google/Microsoft/Mendeley will
see the value of providing Bibserver-compatible APIs.

Any system that helps authors and readers has the opportunity to extract
bibliography in a transparent manner. That's how mendeley get their content
- readers read stuff and provide the metadata

User access/rights can be complex. If you are prepared to do this at a
per-server level then you can use general web technology (login to a site)
without any further work. If you want differential access to records in a
Bibserver I think that's hard, expensive and not worth it at this stage

The problem with this is "sameAs" and deduplication. And this may depend
on what the purpose is. If I am worried (say) about different editions then
I need to make the entries distinct. If I don't care then I try to merge
them. This may not be trivial. Identifier systems are very useful here but
not a panacea .

We are starting to get new deployments almost daily and I think we shall
soon see an O(N^2) level of interest.

Hi Adrian, all

Yes, there will be data dumps available very soon, probably tomorrow. I
will post the details (URL mainly) here as soon as I have them and update
the DataHub entry accordingly. I just wanted to state that both BNE and my
research group (OEG) understand the need for such data dumps, is just that
we did not find the time to make them available.

Thanks again,

Daniel

Doh !  (Homer Simpson style)  this is the __OPEN__ Bibliographic Data list
after all.  So Mendeley has a different idea of OPENness than what this
working group is driving for.  They have an OPEN API that does not require
authentication, only a consumer key after registration.  They also do not
provide an OPEN dump of all the bib data.

If the main complaint their license ? http://dev.mendeley.com/docs/license All
data from the Mendeley API is made available under a Creative Commons
Attribution 3.0 Unported License for commercial and non-commercial
derivations.
If that is the main complaint... then would changing Mendeley's license on
the data to CC0 make it approved according to your principles ?

It's great that this is already cataloged.  I've got a question about
the entry.  It's got the tag "no-license-metadata" but I can't tell by
looking at the universe of things which are tagged with it what it
means.

More generally, can tags have descriptions or is it up to the creator
to choose a name which is descriptive enough on its own?

On a related note, how do I get CKAN/TheDataHub to give me a list of
all openly licensed bibliographic data dumps?  Is there a way to
select multiple tags to filter on at the same time?

Tom

I thought CC-BY met the OKFN definition of "open data."  Is that
incorrect? Where does Mendeley fall short?

We worked hard on this and recommended that licences should be CC0. We
realised that attribution was not appropriate for bibliographic data ,
which we see as FACTUAL data and therefore effectively in the public domain.

(I hadn't seen the Mendeley "requirement" for "attribution". This is
extremely similar to claiming database rights and IMO has no place. )

There is a COST to collecting facts, however.  Each one of us on this list
gets PAID for our time by our employers collecting various facts and even
maintaining them.  Someone has to bear the cost of collecting and
maintaining public facts, and others will want to form a business model in
maintaining and improving the collection of those public facts.  I agree
that Mendeley is not a public institution, and I also agree that Mendeley
with good technological resources and ideas is allowed to form that
business model.

Kudos to Adrian and team for continuing to collect the facts and open them
up from the public sources, just as Mendeley does themselves, but perhaps
sometimes Mendeley does this with more "flair" and "excitement" because of
a polished user interface that had a COST to build.

Also agreed. However, I think we should preferentially assist those who develop business 
models for truly open data, such as MusicBrainz  from which we find:
http://musicbrainz.org/doc/About_MusicBrainz/Data_License
"The core data of the MusicBrainz dataset is placed into the Public Domain, which means that anyone can download and use the core data in any way they see fit."
while at the same time:
"MusicBrainz users give the MetaBrainz Foundation the right to license this data for commercial 
use. The income from these licenses keeps MusicBrainz running and covers the paychecks of paid MusicBrainz developers."
It takes some imagination to develop a business model for collecting and maintaining public facts without unnecessary licensing restrictions, but it can be done, and OKF should encourage those efforts.

The difference between those and bibserver is that bibserver is for
displaying your collection. You get it on a nice searchable web page with
faceting, and you can embed via Javascript on other pages.

We are currently writing a blog post about bibsoup that will include this
distinction. The place for such information is the openbiblio.net blog,
with discussion on open bibliography and open biblio dev mailing lists.

Sure, some person or business may incur costs whilst developing a service,
and may justifiably want to recoup that cost and turn a profit. This is
typical business practice - find a way to add value, and find customers
willing to pay for it.

But doing so by placing restrictions on subsequent reuse of some coincident
resource - in this case bibliographic metadata - is not finding that way;
rather, it is an obfuscation. Risk and effort involved in the process of
adding value are being mitigated by making simultaneous claims to ownership
of the resource around which value is being added.

of course, this is a great business plan; reduce risk and effort by owning
more things. These claims to ownership will be accepted unless they are
contested.

So the question is, should we contest such claims, or are they reasonable
claims to make?

I find it unreasonable that someone be allowed to pollute a resource during
the process of their attempting to exploit it for profit; there is no
reason why their attempts should restrict my desire to utilise said
resource.

this is doubly true in the contexts of service delivery and intellectual
property.

The bibliographic data group on the Data Hub is a good starting point but
there are still not-openly licensed datasets in it: <
http://thedatahub.org/group/bibliographic>. While updating this group a few
days ago I thought about omitting al the data sets which aren't openly
licensed. In the end I didn't. I think we discussed earlier that it might
be useful to see the not-yet-open datasets to be able to easily contact the
maintainers and ask about opening up the data.

By now, I think we could really make the group an "Open Bibligoraphic Data"
group and remove the not-open data sets. What do others think?

All the best
Adrian

Definitely could be worth doing given how easy it is to create a group.

That said you can already see things which are not openly licensed
because of the big "Not Openly Licensed" button and one should also be
able to construct a search query to do this (the issue is one needs to
have an OR query on the set of open licenses -- let me look into
this).

As soon as we have a webpage describing them in more detail I will send the

This is exactly what we are tackling on OKF-open-access where we are
looking at inclusive universal access to (scholarly) info. Open
Bibliography is central to the effort (we are creating an OKD-Open resource
for malaria and basing that on an Open Bibliography core.

We are hoping to create an approach where OKD-Openness is so fundamental
that people naturaly get drawn into using it. We want to avoid early
clashes with those who use "Open" in a less-than OKD manner. Initially
simply by omitting them from the resources.

And can I again thank Adrian for all his work on this. Without the
Principles of Open Bibliography our job would be much harder. And, of
course, the datasets that he is alerting us to.

And also thank Ross Mounce for having tabulated Open bibliographic datasets
as well tackling the problems of non-Open in hybrid journals.

This is really useful info Adrian. Please do add it to the DataHub entry:

<http://thedatahub.org/dataset/deutsche-nationalbibliografie-dnb>

(And ditto for anyone else with useful links or info -- all you need
to do is registerd and then go edit that dataset's notes).

I don't have much experience of bibliographic data munging.

Could anyone suggest ready-made tools with which I could easily
convert the British Library's
"Basic RDF/XML" format to either Bibtex or RIS format?

further details of this format for journal articles are provided here:
http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datasamples.html
and an example file here:
http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/pdfs/journal_article_rdfxml.zip


I basically want the data in a format I can use with Gephi
(http://gephi.org/) for co-authorship exploration analyses. Although
suggestions for other co-authorship analysis tools are also welcome.

(thanks to Guo Xu for the Gephi tip)

Hi Ross,

I am currently converting the BNB into bibjson and uploading it to a
bibserver. Perhaps this may be of help to you. Also, I could share the
scripts I wrote that parse the BNB files and spit out the bibjson - a
quick conversion of those could enable you to get bibtex or something
else into a file.

yes, I think that sounds like something that would be useful. Although
I may have to ask the same type of question again:

How to get from bibjson -> bibtex  (or RIS)

Thanks,

Ross

We have nothing that goes in that direction yet. Would be happy to
share code with you and help work out the problem though. I don't know
much about gephi - would it import JSON? If so, perhaps you could skip
the additional conversion.

I have working code for bibjson -> bibtex though it may be lossy in some cases.
There are issues of how to embed lists of objects in BibTeX, espcially links. I suggest using e.g.

link_1_url = { ... },
link_1_anchor = {... },
link_1_rel = {... },
link_2_url = {... },
link_2_anchor = {... },

Of all the things that are difficult to squash into bibtex, links are by far the most important.

Google Refine's templated exporter could probably get you from BibJSON
to RIS pretty easily (not sure about BibTex's LaTeX encoding of
multinational characters).

Having said that, surely Gephi doesn't take either of these as a
native import format.  Don't you just want clusters of authors (and
other associated metadata) in some tractable format?

> In the Principles of Open Bibliography we declared that a Bibliographic
Entry was not copyrightable. In making this assertion we have the explicit
or implicit agreement of many bodies (for example I obtained a public
statement from the STM publishers). While these opinions do not have the
force of law (and law depends on the domain), they have not been challenged
during the last year.

So it is reasonable to work on the basis that a single bibliographic entry
is not protectable by copyright. [Note that in some domains collections of
factual data (including bibliographic entries) may be protectable by
copyright].
That is why we in POB strongly urge that bibliographic data be placed in
the public domain.

Because bibliographic data is factual there is often no latitude in its
content. The title of a book is a fact, not an opinion. The publisher is a
fact. The number of pages is a fact.

The Mendeley condition appears to be an implicit contract. That if you use
Mendeley you are required to attach Mendeley's trademark to the
bibliographic data that you extract. We contend that the data is
necessarily in the public domain whereas the entry with the Mendeley
trademark is no longer in the public domain. The removal of data from the
public domain is often called Copyfraud (
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyfraud ).

Let us assume that a very large number of people used Mendeley's service
and so the normal expression of a bibliographic entry because in a Mendeley
wrapper. This could lead to (a) people being unaware that bibliographic
data should be PD and (b) the possible accusation that someone publishing
bibliographic data without the Mendeley trademark could be accused of
having misappropriated it from a Mendeley source. Both of these work
against the intention of Open Bibliography and its Principles.

Unfortunately it is difficult to stamp a digital object as being in the
public domain because (a) there is no easy mechanism and (b) it is legal to
take the object and create a derivative work that is legally protectable.

Yeah, refine might be a good option, or some scripts from Jim.

Having had a very cursory look at the front page of gephi, I imagine
this to be the case; why would a vis tool care about bibtex? If so,
you could probably just pull these sorts of lists directly out of the
bibjson.

with a fixed vocabulary and no namespaces. There is likely to be semantic
and content loss. For example the "RIS-like" fields in NIH-RIS do not all
map onto the fields in RIS (or if they do - e.g. "note" or "id" they lose
semantics.

People often try to "mend" this by adding more fields and clever syntax.
This is doomed to failure - it simply breaks software written to the main
standard.

And that's a primary reason why we developed BibJSON. It can hold anything
we want. In summary:

Legacy => BibJSON (no semantic loss, though possibly a need to write more
vocabulary)
BibJSON => Legacy (non-zero probability of semantic loss and content loss)

There is another option, which many systems use:
Rather than merge the records (and risk losing data), the records are 
held in a cluster. For basic displays, one record in the cluster is 
selected (so that you don't get two titles, two journals, etc.), but at 
any point someone using the database can select their preferred citation 
to download or use.

Sometimes the members of the cluster are stored in a somewhat "offline" 
fashion so they don't increase the size of the database for storage and 
retrieval, but there are pointers to the original records.

If you merge and select fields, you cannot easily correct merging 
errors. Keeping all of the incoming records is the only way to re-run 
clustering over time.

Graphml is an easy to hack format for Gephi, especially if you are using
python to hack with - you might find the following code helpful:

https://github.com/benosteen/PubMed-OA-network-analysis-scripts/blob/master/create_network.py

eg

import networkx as nx
from graphml import write_graphml

# the graphml.py in that repo is an improved version of the one in networkx)

g = nx.DiGraph() #directed graph (useful for citations)

g.add_node(node_id, **params) # params is key: value pairs, keys should be
present for all nodes if used.

# for example, params could be
# params = {'title': 'foo',
#                 'author':....  etc
#                 }

g.add_edge(from_node_id, to_node_id) # the edge can also have params

write_graphml(g, open("output.graphml", "w"))


And then just open the graphml in Gephi

New version of BibTeX supports utf-8 encoding. I suugest limiting the export to that,
and advising users how to include utf-8 support in their latex files.

We are going to keep records separate - one record per collection. So
each person will maintain their own record. However, all records can
be searched across a bibsoup, so I am thinking of adding a simple
dropdown to the front end that shows "more like this". So you could
see similar records and probably choose to copy them and so on. In
addition to this, we will probably implement a "parent/slave/sameas"
sort of relationship so a record can be copied from another and know
its provenance, and whether or not to track changes.

These will be on the upcoming sprint plans,

Mark

I am extremely impressed by what Mark and the team have developed. It is
not necessarily inferior to Mendeley. [I do not know the guts of that
system]. Our main feature is that the design has been built by the
community for the community and that the community can control where we
steer it. It gives a very rapid development cycle.

The design is very clean. For me I can see the following use cases which
are potentially quite distinct from Mendeley:
* management of non-traditional objects. This can include datasets,
publishers (as first-class objects). One immediate application is to manage
Ross Mounce's list of licences in hybrid journals. That's a day or two to
create. Another is to manage post-publication commentary on objects such as
through the blogosphere
* community annotation as in the malaria project
* crawling the Open web and making collections of objects for
re-dissemination and algorithmic re-use. In my case it's crystal structures.
* working with organizations such as Wikipedia, public libraries, etc,

I see Bibserver/BibJSON as a set of well-engineered components. Engines,
gearboxes, differentials, etc. You can build something WITH them. The
toolset isn't quite complete but it's not far off and there is enough today
to do valuable stuff.

It's not easy selling tools. I've been trying to do this for 20 years in
chemistry. We are just now starting to get appreciation. of the value of
tools against "applications". The area where it works well is ICT - the
UNIX tools were (and are) one of the great intellectual creations of the
last decades.  I'm literally today stripping my chemical software library
back to the commandline. It's the honest, efficient, clean way to build
systems.

If you want an analogy think of Wikipedia. Bibserver/BibJSON could create a
new way of community thinking about bibliography. That's my vision at least.

Is this parser located some place other than:

https://github.com/okfn/bibserver/tree/master/bibserver/parsers

A quick grep of the tree doesn't seem to show any RDF stuff.

I would agree with this. I don't see any reason to support other encodings
and we have all seen masses of corruption caused by systems that were badly
written in this respect. In other projects I'm in/run we limit encoding to
UTF-8

If I understand the rest it's that we shouldn't output BibTeX escaped
characters (e.g. with backslashes). Again I would agree (I have written
libraries to do this in the past and hated it). We can hope that the world
will continue to move towards universal UTF-8 support.

Holding 2 different representations means that there are continual calls to
normalize(), etc.

If people absolutely require classical BibTeX characters are there services
or programs that will do the conversion?

For the long term, agreed. However, short term fixes can be useful.  We still do not yet
have adequate tools for editing BibJSON, and there are such tools for other formats. I used 
extended BibTeX for many years as a proxy for what has become BibJSON. It is possible and
may be useful for communication to roundtrip even quite complex BibJSON to BibTeX or
other key-value formats. 
I am dealing with a developer who understands BibTeX and doesnt want to deal with BibJSON.
So fine, I can provide a crosswalk. But as you say, any such crosswalk is likely to break
with someone else's BibTeX extension.

Exactly.

This stuff is not in the repo at all. It is stuff I wrote in the last
2 days whilst parsing the BNB dataset. The stuff in the repo is more
for pointing at source files online and parsing on the fly, whereas
what I am doing here is writing a script to parse this particular
file.

However we are also going to separate out the parse functionality so
that parsers can more easily be run separately. If you do want to use
the built-in parsers directly for now, go to bibsoup.net/parse

re. the scripts I offered to share, I will probably just put them up
in a gist rather than in the repo. I have not done it yet because I am
actually still in the process of using them right now.

Yes. The dictionary in the current BibTeX parser can easily be inverted to map a limited set of
utf-8 chars to  their BibTeX/ascii equivalents.  The only problem would be if the utf-8 contains something that is not
in the range of the dictionary. Then some improvisation is required.

Here is the BNB-RDF to JSON script that we started on at the BibServ
sprint last month.
https://gist.github.com/1634031

Mark has been improving it and using that to import over the past few days.
It reads a BNB RDF file as specified as the first parameter, and
prints out a JSON version.

Thanks Etienne. Please can you provide pointer to the wiki space for parser dev planning
which you mentioned on the call on Wednesday? I'd like to take a look and contribute,
and others on the list may also be interested.
many thanks

Thanks Etienne.  Is there a reason it's not in the git repository with
the rest of the parsers?  RDF to BibJSON seems like a generally useful
tool.  I know that everyone's flavor of bibliographic RDF is going to
be different for the moment, but a BNB parser could form the basis of
a DNB parser and, over time, a more generalized RDF parser.

Thanks very much Adrian.  Perhaps your blog post
(http://openbiblio.net/2012/01/26/german-national-library-goes-lod-publishes-national-bibliography/)
could be edited so that the documentation link in your translated
version of the release goes to the English language documentation (or
the summary page that has both sets of info available).

I have updated the previous gist so that the writing of the bibjson
records to elasticsearch is done by stream.

Hi guys,

Sorry for getting back to this discussion so late, but travels/work
did not allow to go through all of it with the attention I woul like.
Nonetheless, now that I did, bibserver/soup looks great! I think this
is an important piece in the puzzle to develop open/free tools for
bibliographic data.

I created an account on bibsoup.net:
http://bibsoup.net/kml/library
and I am now looking at the bibserver code and thinking about putting up
a server of my own in the coming weeks.

I have a couple of questions, whose answers are not obvious to me:
1) Having a personal bibtex file I want to publish (the file itself
contains a PDDL license), how do I annotate the derived bibsoup data
with the corespoding license? Do I need to at all?
2) There was mention of adding an appropriate field to EACH bibtex
entry with the relevant license information. Is this in fact desirable,
or overkill, and why?
3) I have some scripts I use to manage my biblio data, which I keep
track of on github along with the files. What license is appropriate
for these files? A data-centered license, or a code-centered license?
4) I'd like to operate a bibserver/bibsoup instance on my own machine
and push any updates I make locally to this server, triggered by
a git commit or similar action. Is this easily achievable at present?

Thanks for all the great work!
Karol

You can put license information into your bibjson, but there is not a
corresponding field in bibtex that I know of, so it could not go in
there. You would therefore have to write the bibjson manually and push
from there. We will be adding edit soon though, so you could add
license info then.

You could put it on the record or on the collection if you want to.

Not sure about that, if you have two different types of thing. One for each?

You could run your own bibserver and from there you could ingest your
collections to bibsoup.net. There is no built-in trigger for that, but
you could certainly script it. Just curl the JSON from your collection
(add .json to the collection URL), then curl it to your bibsoup.net
account using your API KEY.

Thanks!

Sure it can. BibTeX is extensible, and you just add a licence field or fields.
This reminds me of a question I have about  http://bibjson.org/
In the proposed licence BibJSON

{
    "license": [
        {
            "type": "copyheart",
            "url": "http://copyheart.org/manifesto/",
            "description": "A great license",
            "jurisdiction": "universal"
        }
    ]
}
is it intended that this is the license of the document that the record is about, or the
license of the record itself? This is not obvious without some documentation/convention. 
Now that Mendeley and others are slapping licenses on biblio records, this is a serious issue.

> You would therefore have to write the bibjson manually and push from there. We will be adding edit soon though, so you could add

I think we should tolerate obvious BibTeX equivalents of the above JSON like

license_type = copyheart,
license_url = http://copyheart.org/manifesto/,
...

or to be more pedantic e.g.

license_type = ....
license_url = ....

for the  original doc and

self_license_type = ....
self_license_url = ....

for the biblio record itself. We need some such convention in the BibJSON too.

I think a one-line indication of license just pointing to a license url in each record would be good. 
Could OKF support suitable stable urls with PD license assertions for biblio data, both records and collections?

Yes, but our parser does not read for that.

Given that we wrote the principles last year and link to them from the
front, our entire point is that bib metadata are facts. If we stick
licenses on them, they will appear licensable. so the license is about
whatever the record is about.


> I think we should tolerate obvious BibTeX equivalents of the above JSON like

This would require ongoing maintenance of the bibtex parser. We are
supposed to be trying to move away from bibtex, not support it
indefintely.

Are you saying we should change bibjson so that license is just a string then?

We cannot expect all BibJSON users to follow this chain of reasoning. We must be explicit about it in the spec.

Right. But if we have users who are stuck using BibTeX or other tools to maintain their collections, we will need to
support their practices until good JSON management tools are available, and they are not yet.

Just a url, yes, for the license assertion on the biblio record, that might be useful.
Biblio records may carry baggage with them which is licensable or copyrightable even if the basic metadata are not.
Especially, I think we should consider a practice of attaching abstracts and keywords or subject tags, even if taken from
a publisher's site, with a claim of "fair use" by US copyright doctrine.
This may be something for the broader list, not just the dev list.

So we should put a line on bibjson.org that says biblio metadata are facts.

license may as well be a list of objects, because there are licenses
without URLs. Even if someone like the OKF maintained a list, there
would be a time where there was a license not on that list. Making it
an object saves anyone maintaining a list.

If you want to apply a license to the metadata record itself, then you
will need a separate key for that.

There are the following problems:
* it is technically not easy to add a complete licence (CF CC licences in
RDF for adding to HTML pages)
* We don't think licences are the right way to go about asserting Open
Bibliography.

However I think it highly useful to have a single non-legal field such as
    "rights" : http://openbiblio.net/principles/
This ;points the users to our site, costs little real estate and is
educative

the problem with this though is that there will be some records where
this is added because people know to add it, but others where it is
not. Same is true if we apply from the backend - do we do so only when

comes from a parser outwith our control? If we put anything like this

Hello,

the next virtual meeting of the openbiblio working group will be on
Tuesday, February, 7th 2012, 16:00 GMT.

See the etherpad at http://okfnpad.org/18th-open-bibliography-meeting

Feel free to add agenda points. I believe that there are some things
to report on the JISC OpenBib 2 project so it would be nice if someone
could report on this.

@Naomi: It might make sense if you added an agenda point for the
question you mailed me. It's probably best to clarify in the skype
meeting...


All the best
Adrian

Fwd: from Open Hum list. Any ideas?

...

Hi all,

Wondered if anyone knows anything about the possibility of getting
structured data from Wikisource bibliography pages? And/or whether the
new Wikimedia Deutschland data pilot [1] involves bibliographic
information on Wikisource?

It would be good to build on, and contribute back to things like:
http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Friedrich_Nietzsche

I'm particularly interested in the possibility of using/building on
these bibliographies for OpenPhilosophy.org [2].

Also interested in whether there are any ideas about mapping the
titles in different languages. E.g. latin title, German translation of
title and English translation of title all refer to different
manifestations of same underlying work (or whatever other data
model...).

All the best,

Jonathan

Thanks Sam for pushing this to the openbiblio lists. Two important issues
here.

1) We should look into creating/maintaining a converter to BibJSON from Wikisource bibliography pages , also approaching Wikimedia about possibility of BibJSON export. Volunteers for either task?

2)  We should give BibJSON capability of indicating title of work in 
different languages. Same for abstract and possibly other fields like keywords.
There are some subtleties.  A title or abstract or keywords may be translated, 
even if the work is not. It should then be indicated which is the original 
field, in which language, and which fields are are translations.

Another thing I have wondered about in BibJSON is subtitles.
Are there standards we could easily borrow from, for either translations or subtitles?

for our union catalogue at the university of Cologne (Germany) I've
already integrated bibliographic data of the german wikisource
xml-dump and blogged about it (in german):

http://blog.openbib.org/2009/08/08/integration-von-wikisource-in-den-kug/

and

http://blog.openbib.org/2009/08/21/dfg-viewer-fur-wikisource-im-kug/

At that time (2009) the set of bibliographic categories of the german
wikisource was much richer than eg. the english or french ones.

Apart from the integration in our main discovery interface at

http://kug.ub.uni-koeln.de/

with around 11.500.000 Titles in 193 separate (local) databases, we
also offer a dedicated search interface only for wikisource at:

http://wikisource.ub.uni-koeln.de/

alongside our other "special collections" (at the central university
library):

http://blog.openbib.org/2011/11/09/sammlungen-revisited/

A converted title from the german wikisource looks like this:

http://kug.ub.uni-koeln.de/portal/connector/permalink/wikisource_de/26797/1/wikisource/index.html

Please do add your comments and populate the different examples, and add
sites not mentioned below. I may well have paraphrased incorrectly, so
please do edit away.

I have also blogged about it here

Following are some reactions, some of which could  be incorporated in this wiki, but others
seem better discussed first on the list as they concern the structure and purpose of the wiki and related systematic
efforts by this WG rather than the proposed wiki content.

There should be a link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software

I think it should be emphasised more that BibServer/BibSoup is not competing in the
domain of reference management. Rather, BibServer/BibSoup facilitates publication, display and sharing
of bibliographic data collected by whatever means. It seems critical to me for early success in expanding
interest and support for BibJSON/BibServer/BibSoup that we emphasise and facilitate the interoperability aspect:
that BibJSON is a rich enough format that it can embed the structure of most data in other standard bibliographic formats,
and that it should be possible to create and maintain an open source community of coders with a shared interest in frictionless
sharing of bibliographic data maintained with whatever management tools.  We should aim to facilitate import and export of biblio
data to/from any of the systems listed in the wikipedia page, and develop a community of coders with an interest in supporting
this activity.  These ref man systems naturally compete with each other for users and developers, largely for commercial reasons.
We are offering a different product in this space, which aims to open up the data presently managed in these systems, and
to make it much more freely available and reusable. I think we should use pages like the wiki to to convey some of the excitement of 
this effort, to generate interest in the commuity, and get coders to spend their time writing converters and apps based on BibJSON/BibSoup 
rather than submitting entries to offensive competitions run by proprietary bib management systems which end up owning the code and exploiting
it for their own commercial purposes.

About "please keep bias to a minimum, we want facts not opinions!".
I dont think NPoV is the way to go.  We already have the Wikipedia page for the facts. I see little point in replicating the wikipedia table
unless we can make it more accessible or better organized or machine-readable. But just copying from one wiki to another wont achieve any of those things.

I would rather see a table of progress of integration between BibJSON/BibServer/BibSoup and each of the systems listed in the wikipedia table.
That seems to me what is special which this community can provide: guidance with code and exemplar datasets for how to get data in and out of these management
systems and to exchange it into the public domain with tools and services this community is supporting.
We would prefer the big biblio management systems to cooperate with us by providing BibJSON exports with an open licence, rather than for us to have to  maintain a large number of converters
and risk legal issues if we are too aggressive in claiming data for the public domain. I see the same issue in dealing with all of
Mendeley, Microsoft, Google Scholar, Zotero, BibSonomy, .... The risks and rewards vary from provider to provider.

How to kick start that community development process, to get some momentum going in supporting interoperability between BibJSON/BibServer/BibSoup and the dominant
reference management systems? I dont think we have answered that question yet, or adequately defined the community structure or political process by which 
it can be achieved. The political process could be some mix of grass-roots activism, connector code sprints, data liberation efforts, and high level contact between OKF appointed 
representatives and representatives of the dominant ref management systems. Individuals like Peter MR and myself have contacts with reps of some of these systems. But we do not
currently have the political authority to make representations or agreements on behalf of OKF or its WG. 
Some template for interaction like http://www.isitopendata.org/ would also seem desirable. But if the data owners claim it is not open, we need strategies to make it so.

I'd also be glad to see more of Peter's rants against pseudo-openness and Mendeley copyfraud under the OKF flag.
We had quite a spirited discussion on the list of issues around appropriation of Bib data from the public domain. 
Why not air some more of that out in the blogosphere?  This is a strategic issue for the openbiblio community.
I am not clear how  OKF can help resolve such issues through the WG structure. Perhaps it is best just for Peter to blast
away from his blog and for OKF WG to take a more moderate position. I am not sure.  

In any case, I hope this post may stimulate further discussion of how best this WG could assist on the community side in supporting
the great efforts Mark has made in developing openbiblio services.

Ah, if it is already on wikipedia then just delete our page and link
to the wikipedia version from our own wiki - job done.

All we need to interoperate is to parse one of their export formats.
So we just need to know what export formats they support - if BibTex
or RIS, we can already do it, which probably covers many of them.

As above we can already do that where we can parse one of their export
formats. We have no control over what they import.

All we need to know is which ones do not export in a format we already parse.

Yes, so we need to show that people are using our tool (which they are
starting to do) and then ask if they are interested in exporting
bibjson. But if not, we can stil just parse what they do export.

Apart from that we have already demonstrated doing it - we just need
to know if there is a a big refman system that does not export
something we already parse.

Just use isitopendata.org

We already link to Peters blog posts from openbiblio.net, and can do
so a bit more. We could also syndicate some of his posts in their
entirety, but I think they actually have better impact from his own
blog.

I rant not because I enjoy it (though it creates adrenalin) but because I
am so frustrated and angry with the indifference of academia (in
particular) to the opportunities  of the 21stC. We are losing opportunities
daily. Elsevier is now offering us textmining for money and so are other
publishers. This is double copytheft (shut up... no ranting allowed here...)

The real power of Bibserver/Bibsoup are its potential as a creative tool
for innovation. It can manage things other than publications - such as a
lists of publishers, grants, organisations (There's probably a near
seamless transition to CKAN here). We can create mashups in a way that
other tecchnologies don't allow. That's why Open Research reports are so
exciting. We use annotations and links on BibJSON to bring in other
resources.

Our strengths are that we generate communities (in a way that few walled
gardens can do). That we can offer everything to anybody instantly without
worrying about IP, licences etc. That our thinking aligns with government
and other organizations. Every time that a new chunk of biblio appears we
gain the interest of the people providing it. And they often have contacts,
resources, enthusiasm, volunteers, etc.

Agree with Jim. This is not reference management. It is building the Open
map of Open Scholarship and using it as a fundamental technology to change
the world.

Thanks for putting that together Naomi.  After I sent my original
query I discovered that Wikipedia has a comparison of 28 different
existing solutions in the space I was thinking of:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_reference_management_software
(Just noticed that Jim pointed out the same thing while this was
sitting half composed)

Mark's statement that BibServer is focused on web publishing and
faceted search of bibliographies clarified things for me a lot.  As I
understand it now, there's really no overlap at all with Zotera or
Mendeley or other bib management solutions.  BibServer fits at the
very last stage in the life cycle when it's time to publish (on the
web rather than view LaTex or Word).  Instead comparisons would be to
things like Drupal Scholar http://drupal.org/project/biblio or other
web publishing platforms.

As an aside, I'm not sure if proselytizing BibJson or tracking it's
adoption is a goal, but that same Wikipedia page includes listings of
format support for BibTeX, RIS, etc by the various software packages.
That could probably be extended pretty easily to track BibJson.

I found a partial answer to this.  Clicking on a tag behaves
differently depending on your context.  In the context of a single
dataset's entry (e.g. http://thedatahub.org/dataset/datos-bne-es),
clicking a tag shows all the entries for that tag, but doesn't give
you a way to combine that tag with any other.

However, if you start at the search panel, clicking a tag adds it to
the active filters and you can click as many tags as you want, adding
and removing them.  You can do a similar thing with groups and combine
them with tags.

The thing I haven't figured out yet, is how to facet on license or
license category (open/not open).  The closest I've gotten so far is

    http://thedatahub.org/dataset?groups=publicdomain&q=&groups=bibliographic
or
    http://thedatahub.org/dataset?groups=publicdomain&q=&tags=bibliographic

which return 2 and 1 results, respectively, so clearly that's not
right.  I tried several different variations of license=cc0,
licenses=cc-zero, etc without luck.

Is there a way to constrain a search by license?

As a stop gap, I've added 'cc0' and 'publicdomain' tags to datasets
that I was able to locate by clicking around.  Feel free to add these
tags to other data sets I've missed.

The following two queries will find some of the more liberally
licensed bibliographic data sets:

http://thedatahub.org/dataset?tags=bibliographic&tags=cc0
http://thedatahub.org/dataset?tags=bibliographic&tags=publicdomain

===============================================================

ABOUT THE WEBINAR

Libraries have been creating metadata for resources for well over a
century. The good news is that library metadata is rules-based and
that the library cataloging community has built up a wealth of
knowledge about publications, their qualities, and the users who seek
them. The bad news is that library practices were fixed long before
computers would be used to store and retrieve the data. Library
cataloging practice continues to have elements of the era of printed
catalogs and alphabetized cards, and needs to modernize to take
advantage of new information technologies. This metadata, however,
exists today in tens of thousands of databases and there is a large
sigh heard around the world whenever a librarian considers the need to
make this massive change.

As with all large problems, this one becomes more tractable when
broken into smaller pieces. Karen Coyle will present her "five stars
of?library data," an analysis of the changes needed and some steps
that?libraries can begin to take immediately. She will also discuss
the?"open world" view of the linked data movement and how this view
can?increase the visibility of libraries in the global information
space.?This webinar will give an introduction to the types of changes
that?are needed as well as the value that can be realized in library
services. Attendees will learn of some preparatory steps have already
been taken, which should confirm that libraries have indeed begun the
journey "From Here to There."

TOPICS AND SPEAKERS

Karen Coyle is a librarian specializing in metadata development, with
a particular interest in the future of bibliographic control. She
recently served on the W3C Incubator Group on Library Linked Data, and
has written three Library Technology Reports on the Semantic Web and
library data.

Thomas Baker, Chief Information Officer of the Dublin Core Metadata
Initiative, was recently co-chair of the W3C Semantic Web Deployment
Working Group and currently co-chairs a W3C Incubator Group on Library
Linked Data.

REGISTRATION

Registration is per site (access for one computer) and closes at 12:00
pm Eastern on February 22, 2012. Discounts are available for NISO and
DCMI members and students.

Can?t make it on the webinar date/time? You can still register and

Yes, all good positive answers, and we should continue to do what we can to 
reinforce this behaviour by providing attractive open biblio services which
harvest and add value to such personal listings. 
Are we at the point yet when we should contribute a pointer to BibSoup 
and encourage scholars to use that facility? 
Mark, this is your call really, about when you want to go more public
with BibSoup. Then you or Naomi could start contributing BibSoup advertisements
in response to questions like this.

Yes - every reason why researchers should maintain their own lists. I have
not come across a search engine or bibliography aggregator which gives an
accurate bibliography for me. Of course if all people are interested in is
the glorious hIndex it doesn't matter about the details - just which engine
you "believe".

I think we are close to going public. A few carefully chosen high quality
bibsoups would be a useful way of illustrating the diverrsity of uses.

All,

BibSoup is now launched!
http://openbiblio.net/2012/02/09/bibsoup-beta-released/ (went out on
Thursday, but to be updated)
http://blog.okfn.org/2012/02/13/open-biblio-launches-bibsoup-in-beta/ (went
out this morning)

Please have a play around, upload your lists, make bubble charts and
generally see how this is going to work for you. Suggestions / comments
welcome.

Huge thanks to Mark, Etienne, Peter, Jim and all others who have helped
towards BibSoup - great job!

Regards,
Naomi

The obvious first question is whether they know if they hold the rights 
to their own metadata. If they do hold the rights, then it comes down to 
1) their willingness to share 2) any technical impediments.

Hi all,

I thought the below might be of interest to some of you - an Energy and
Climate Hackday next month.

Also, the Open Knowledge Festival 2012 <http://okfestival.org> was
announced last week - do join the public OKFest discussion
list<http://lists.okfn.org/mailman/listinfo/okfestival-coord>and put
the dates in your diary.

Regards,
Naomi

Dear list,

I am happy to announce that we have now fixed the date for the Energy and
Climate Hackday to take place on March 3rd. This would possibly give us
sufficient time to complete any application to submit to the Apps4Climate
World Bank competition (March 16 - deadline).

We would also have a circle during the Hackday dedicated to the DECC 2050
Pathways Calculator (http://2050-calculator-tool.decc.gov.uk/pathways) with
representatives from DECC, who would like to develop an international
version of the application.

If you are interested in co-organising this event and have ideas about
other circles to take place during the Hackday, you are more than welcome!

The location will be confirmed soon and along with a blog post invitation.
You are also welcome to join the Energy and Climate DataParty on the 1st of
March to data mine and mash up climate and energy data. I will keep you
posted with the details.

Apparently, from http://www.oclc.org/research/news/2012-02-15.htm

"The bulk downloadable versions of FAST are offered at no charge. Like FAST content available through the FAST Experimental Linked Data Service, the downloadable versions of FAST are made available under the Open Data Commons Attribution (ODC-By) license."

Etienne, do you think you could do a parse to map these to some form of JSON/BibJSON and post e.g. to CKAN?

That exercise would push some issues of how BibJSON should embed subject headings.
Other obvious headings datasets to provide BibJSON parsers for are MESH and MSC2010. I've done some previous
work on MSC2010 and will be glad to keep pushing that along.
We should try to develop some systematic way to make subject ontologies available to BibJSON users, and especially
aim to have these ontologies seamlessly available to BibJSON dataset creators in whatever editing interfaces we are able to 
provide.

Best outcome for us is if OCLC would host JSON as an alternate export format for FAST with a link to BibJSON which 
would raise the visibility of our BibJSON efforts. I dont think current BibJSON is rigorous enough for that level of exposure
yet. But with some attention to version control and validation as per previous discussions on the dev list, we are nearly there.

Anyone with connections to OCLC willing to play a diplomatic role in encouraging OCLC to provide JSON export for FAST?

Yes we could, but do we want to? I do not see the immediate value of
converting a dump like this to JSON.
The FAST data is already available as a resource with URIs that can be
queried or linked to from a running BibServer.
Why do we need to convert in bulk if we can link to a resource that is
maintained?

 For example, (just pulling a random item from the air here) if we
want to link this:
  http://bnb.bibsoup.net/bibsoup/bnb/GB7409399
we could programmitcally connect it to:
  http://experimental.worldcat.org/fast/813004/
and see where it leads from there.

And the same goes for any other subject heading datasets. (many of
which do not have well-maintained, or linkable, or crippled online
versions, so there I can see the value of doing conversions)

The value is that it lowers the barrier to use and processing of the dataset, hence increases the value of the dataset.
For example, I am interested in the structure of the math/stat section of FAST, and would be willing
to cross-link that to MSC2010 and other subject classification and navigation  efforts I have made in math/stat.
To do that, I have to parse the FAST data as it is at present, and map it to my data format of choice which
is JSON. I am not an expert in the formats FAST is currently in, and would do an inefficient job of mapping it,
and dont want to have to deal with the whole dataset.

This problem is generic. I have the same problem with all the big library dump datasets. I am seriously interested
in the math/stat portions of all of them, could add value to all of them by cross-linking and applying  my domain
expertise. But I should not have to be doing the heavy lifting of getting the datasets from where they are now
to extract what I care about from them. Every domain expert who is not well equipped with the tools to process large datasets 
has this problem.  This group should I think be doing all it can to engage  those domain experts and enabling
them to add value to these massive library dumps which otherwise will just sit where they are and not be made use of
by the people who could add value to them.

> The FAST data is already available as a resource with URIs that can be queried or linked to from a running BibServer.

But the returns are not in BibJSON, right?
Writing a parser to BibJSON over these services would be very useful. I am not sure if that would solve the problem of the user like me
who wants the entire subset of math/stat headings. I suppose I could spider over the current FAST interface to get what I wanted.
But it should be easier than that to get large chunks of the data defined in obvious ways, like all of math or all of stat.

> Why do we need to convert in bulk if we can link to a resource that is maintained?

I hope I have answered adequately above. It is possible and perhaps best if my use case can be met by writing a JSON wrapper around an existing
maintained API. I'm just not sure if that is adequate. I know if I had a complete dump in JSON I could just go through it and do it myself in half
an hour.  Sure, I could do that in RDF too, but it would take me some days to learn what that was all about, and parse the data for myself, and I know from 
past experience that time spent learning RDF/SPARQL/... is time wasted. I respect that there are industrial agents for which (perhaps) RDF is the appropriate framework.
But I dont need the friction of dealing with RDF. Gimme the JSON in bulk!

Nice. Better still is the JSON
http://bnb.bibsoup.net/bibsoup/bnb/GB7409399.json
The page should show itself how to find that (I just guessed and got lucky)

Yes. But where is the JSON?
And how can I iterate this to get every record in BNB and in FAST that haas anything to do with math or stat?
That is my use case, and I dont see how it is met either by the library dumps or by current APIs.

My comments too apply to all such subject heading datasets. 

Many thanks for looking at this!

I don't know why they would want to. They've issued FAST as linked data. 
JSON would be a step backward, and wouldn't fit into their current 
development direction. I think if you want it in JSON you need to 
provide that.

Here's a sample record. Note that headings are typed as "topical, 
geographic, event, time" and more. There are broader, narrower and 
related links. I believe they are doing some links to data sets like 
GeoNames.

Dear all (apologies for cross-posting)

data.europeana.eu has already existed for several months, but I thought it could be useful to share the following re-release with you, since all the metadata there is now CC0.
We of course wish to release even more in the coming months. We hope in the meantime that what we release will be used in some services. We stand ready to help anyone who'd be interested!

Dear Partners,

As Linked Open Data (LOD) is gaining traction in the information world right now, Europeana has just launched an _animation <http://vimeo.com/36752317>_ to explain something about it and its benefits for users and data providers.

As major heritage institutions are embracing the concept and making their data openly available, Europeana is also* *facilitating LOD developments. We've published our first dataset comprising _2.4 million objects <http://data.europeana.eu>_under CC0. Not only can this data be enriched to improve user experience, but it can also be used to develop innovative applications and help create new web services.

Support for Open Data innovation is also at the root of Europeana?s new _Data Exchange Agreement <http://pro.europeana.eu/support-for-open-data>_, the contract that you, as partners, are asked to agree to when your metadata goes into Europeana.

The Data Exchange Agreement has now been signed by all the national libraries, by leading national museums such as the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, and by many of the content providers for entire countries, such as Sweden?s National Heritage Board. The new Data Exchange Agreement dedicates the metadata to the Public Domain and comes into effect on 1 July 2012, after which all metadata in Europeana will be available as Open Data.

Europeana has just put out a press release <http://bit.ly/w6tS2Y> about the animation and Linked Open Data pilot. It would be valuable if you could translate the release, put it on your website, circulate it to your press lists and forward it to your networks.

With regards,

The Europeana Team

Dear Isaac
I think that the presentation is very useful because it is really understandable for non very technical people. I have put it yestarday in my facebook wall and I'am going to write something in Spanish to introduce it and, after that, I will send it to IWETEL which, although not very technical is largest Spanish librarianship discussion list over 6000 people.
By the way, we have finished the translation of the Final Report and send to Tom Baker who has pointed only three or four remarks. We have also reviewed the other two documents, Use Case and Datasets..., which had been translated by people from the Universidad Polit?cnica and Universidad de Murcia with the aim of unifying terminology. In this week all documents will be available on the Fundaci?n Ignacio Larramend website.

Xavier
