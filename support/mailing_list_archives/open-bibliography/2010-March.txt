I dont really want to be an admin. But I do want to push this group to eat some bibliographic dogfood 
and make this list machine-readable and useful.  Preferably JSON, but XML or RDF or whatever. 
And please include attributes like number and format of records.
This is a tiny list right now, just provide a complete JSON or XML export at e.g. 
http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic/json
http://ckan.net/group/bibliographic/xml

Browsing around the CKAN site I see no API, no XML or JSON export, no feeds, nothing machine-readable.
I did find the gzipped dump file http://www.ckan.net/dump/ which is updated daily.
I would think the above features could be obtained by taking this daily dump and updating an image of it e.g.
within delicious or bibsonomy which might provide further functionality, visibility  and API access.

CKAN has a full RESTful API and search interface that talks JSON. See
<http://www.ckan.net/api/>

So, for example, to get all packages  from the bibliographic data
group you could do:

<http://ckan.net/api/search/package?groups=bibliographic>

To get it with all package attributes:

<http://ckan.net/api/search/package?groups=bibliographic&all_fields=1>

> Browsing around the CKAN site I see no API, no XML or JSON export, no feeds, nothing machine-readable.

I was about to say haven't you seen the "API" link the main navbar
when I double-checked about found it had disappeared! A quick check of
the codebase revealed the link had been removed 3 weeks ago during a
bit of routine refactoring (accidentally I suspect). Anyway it is now
back. (BTW google is your friend here as a google for "ckan api" seems
to work quite well!).

I also note there is a command line called datapkg which communicates
with CKAN via that REST API:

<http://knowledgeforge.net/ckan/doc/datapkg/>
<http://blog.okfn.org/2010/02/23/introducing-datapkg/>

As you will see, the good news is that this isn't necessary! Apologies
for the missing API link and let me know if there isn't anything else
I can help with.

Rufus

Marvellous!  I am so relieved to learn that. 
Now a question is: how happy you are with the tools you have in place for managing this sort of data?
There is a lot of data in this vein which partners in the BKN project should be glad to contribute.
I would be glad to work with okfn to find maintainers on this data.
BKN offers a standard,
 BibJSON  http://www.bibkn.org/bibjson/index.html 
intended to rigorize JSON export formats such as 
<http://ckan.net/api/search/package?groups=bibliographic&all_fields=1>
without going to a full RDF implementation which BKN partners find too heavy for immediate applications.
I would welcome contributions to the development and maintenance of BibJSON from any of the
participants in this group. Please follow up with http://groups.google.com/group/bibjson if you are interested.
Many thanks

Dear Lukas,

My apologies for the misunderstanding! We'd be delighted to have your
input to the group even if you're not able to be very active and
you're not able to make all the virtual meetings. Alternately let me
know (off list?) and I can remove you from the group! ;-)

Happy to answer any questions about the OKF and about the new working
group. A couple of brief things:

  * The Open Knowledge Foundation is a not-for-profit, community
driven organisation dedicated to promoting open knowledge in all its
forms - from sonnets to statistics, genes to geodata. Projects range
from CKAN, an open source registry of open data (recently used in
data.gov.uk) to legal tools for making data open
(opendatacommons.org). We're in the process of establishing a number
of working groups related to open data and open content in different
areas, e.g. open data in science, the public domain, open government
data, and so on.
  * This working group up was set up in the first instance to
strengthen the network of people interested in bibliographic data that
is open as in opendefinition.org. Also in the longer term we hope
there is scope for collaboration on projects related to bibliographic
data. The full statement of purpose can be found on the working group
page: http://wiki.okfn.org/wg/bibliography

Regarding specific projects and activities, at the moment we're
particularly interested in:

  * Sharing best practices, experience and expertise in relation to
opening up bibliographic data. Especially for libraries that are
considering this but perhaps don't know about how to make their data
legally open.
  * Explaining why libraries and other metadata collections might
consider opening up their data - and how doing this might create value
for libraries and library users.
  * Developing systems for the collaborative development of
bibliographic data - e.g. with users, permissions, versioning, etc.
  * Documenting and/or developing projects which reuse open
bibliographic metadata. E.g. representing data on authors and works on
maps, timelines and other visualisation technologies. Cleaning up and
connecting bibliographic datasets to other open datasets (e.g. in
Linked Open Data community).
  * Writing/blogging about the future of bibliographic data. How
bibliographic data can be more effectively shared and updated.

Would greatly appreciate any input/suggestions for list above!

All the best,

Jonathan

This recent guide from JISC may be of interest
http://www.jisclegal.ac.uk/Projects/TransferandUseofBibliographicRecords.aspx

Of course, it is UK focussed, but it is likely to be the place many UK University libraries look for advice on the legalities of sharing bibliographic records.

That would be great Jim.

This looks great. One question (and I apologize if this is answered in
the spec -- I haven't gone through it in detail): how does bibjson
relate to the FRBR schema concepts (if at all).

So you mean a CKAN Package would become a type of bibliographic
record? That's definitely an interesting idea.

Ah! YAS (Yet Another Standard!)

I think that standardization could be considered a part of openness,  
because one of the problems we have once the data is "open" is that  
everyone's data uses different standards. While some of that is  
inevitable, I think in my bibliographic lifetime I have seen dozens of  
different lists of document types (genres in some lingos),  
bibliographic types, etc. All defined in different documents. Is there  
some way we can begin to bring these together so that everyone is at  
least drinking from the same well? (BTW, I am a firm believer in use  
of base standards + application profiles, and I would consider Jim's  
work an application profile.)[1]

One of the ways that this relates to openness is that there is  
commercialization of bibliographic "standards" that makes openness  
hard. If there were open standards for the bibliographic data elements  
then open services could evolve. I am of course thinking about things  
like the VMF project[2], which will probably evolve in the same  
direction that the DOI did and will become a closed system; and the  
Dewey Decimal System, which presumably cannot be used without a  
license. Trying to avoid just that, some of us are attempting to  
"open" the US library data by registering data elements in RDF,[3] but  
it's too early to see if that would be successful. The chief challenge  
is actual "standardization" -- that is, getting the data accepted by a  
wide community. That's a whole 'nuther discussion, however.

Thanks for flagging this up Owen! I had seen it a little while ago,
but had not had a chance to look at it yet. I've contacted Naomi Korn
and the others to inform them of this group.

All the best,

Hallo,
 
my name is Adrian Pohl. I am very happy that this working group was
launched by the Open Knowledge Foundation. Thank you, Jonathan. I am
working at the Hochschulbibliothekszentrum Nordrhein-Westfalen (hbz,
http://www.hbz-nrw.de) one of the six german library consortia. For some
time now we are delving into Linked Open Data, its technical, political
and legal problems. 
 
Hopefully we will soon put a few bibliographic databases in the public
domain in cooperation with some libraries. Naturally, there are some
questions coming up about how to best open up raw data. Besides the
questions where to put the data and how to best time and announce this
act (questions we will answer by ourselves) I got a question you might
be able to help me with:
 
How should I describe raw datasets? Does a vocabulary exist so that I
can describe the relevant properties of a dataset (size, number of
records, format, date of export, extent: whole database or part, query
parameters if only a part is opened etc.)?
 
I think it would be a good thing to describe an open raw dataset with
an rdf-file so at least the dataset could be a Linked-Data-Resource as a
whole... I've been searching for a vocabulary for quite a while but
couldn't find one. Any suggestions or do we have to create a vocabulary
ourselves?
 
What kind of vocabulary uses CKAN? Are there any plans to describe the
open datasets in rdf? Is the OKFN perhaps already working on a
vocabulary, Jonathan & Rufus?
 
Looking forward to your answers
Adrian

Hi Adrian,

I guess the Void vocabulary is a good starting point. Here is the pointer: http://rdfs.org/ns/void

Hi Adrian:

You might want to look at Richard Cyganiak and Fadi Maali's brand new
Data Catalog Vocabulary:

  http://vocab.deri.ie/dcat

Several deri.ie sites seem to be down for maintenance right now, but
it's worth checking out when they come back. I think Richard and Fadi
are looking for feedback...

As others have already pointed out for *rdf* datasets the way to go is
probably VoID. If your dataset isn't rdf then it is a little more
complicated since VoID is very rdf/linked-open-dataset oriented. One
option is just to use dct:Dataset. At the moment we are using a
combination of these approaches for the RDF version of ckan data ...

Regarding the second question I think for something as major as
different licensing for different parts of the dataset you might want
to consider splitting the dataset up.

See comment above. More info on the CKAN RDF setup can be found here:

Our aim is to reuse existing vocabs wherever possible ...

If memory serves Richard's Data Catalog Vocabulary [1]  integrates
dublincore, void and adds some new terms so that it is not just for
RDF datasets. I guess I'll have to wait for their server to get back
online to confirm though.

To: JISC-ANNOUNCE at jiscmail.ac.uk


***Apologies for Cross Posting***
JISC invites institutions to submit funding proposals for projects to
undertake work under the fifth round of its Learning and Teaching
Innovation Grants Programme.
JISC wishes to fund one year projects and activities that fit with the
vision, outcomes and principles of the JISC e-Learning programme and
support innovative approaches to learning and teaching. This is an
open call, and projects dealing with any aspect of e-learning are
welcomed. To reduce the initial investment in time and resource needed
to develop a traditional JISC proposal and to encourage speculative
and innovative ideas from the community bidders are invited to submit
outline proposals.
As with the last round, these outline proposals must be submitted via
email.?The short form of these initial bids has also been retained and
we will be strictly enforcing word limits and content restrictions.
Please read the guidance and template in full - bids outside of the
required parameters will NOT be assessed.
JISC have run four previous rounds of the Learning and Teaching
Innovation Grant funding opportunity in May 2008, August 2008, January
2009 and July 2009. In total, the programme has supported 14 projects.
Bids should be submitted?to ELEARNING-BIDS at JISC.AC.UK, using the
template provided. Letters of support will not be required at this
stage.
Funds of up to ?50,000 for?projects of one year duration are
available. JISC has committed at least ?1,000,000 for this activity
over the life?of this programme which commenced in May 2008.
Eligibility
Proposals may be submitted by HE institutions funded via HEFCE, SFC,
HEFCW and DEL Northern Ireland, and by FE institutions funded via SFC,
DCELLS Wales and DEL Northern Ireland. FE institutions in England that
teach HE to more than 400 FTEs are also eligible to bid provided
proposals demonstrate how the work supports the HE in FE agenda.
Proposals may be from single institutions or consortia. Partnership
arrangements may be developed outside the sector (for example with
research council sites, publishers, commercial suppliers), but the
lead partner must meet the criteria outlined above. Funds can only be
allocated through the lead partner.
Please note: The lead institution may only submit one proposal per
assessment point.
The next deadline for submissions is 12 noon UK time on 19 April 2010.
You can access the main call page here.

Dear open data friends,

we did it! (Partially, the second round will come on monday but the news
is already going around.)

You'll find the joint statement below or on
http://www.hbz-nrw.de/dokumentencenter/presse/pm/datenfreigabe_engl 

The link mentioned at the bottom of the statement won't work until
monday. But you already can have a look at the data dump the Cologne
University Library made from their local data:
http://opendata.ub.uni-koeln.de/ (There you get access to more than 3
Million records.)

So, the first step is taken. We now need more open bibliographic data
and an open-data-practice similar to that Nat Torkington is envisioning
in this post: http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/03/truly-open-data.html

And we did this in only 9 days with just on meeting between the
libraries and the hbz!

Joint statement of the North Rhine-Westphalian Library ServiceCenter,
the University and Public Library of Cologne, the UniversityLibrary of
the University of Applied Science of Cologne, the Library ofthe Academy
of Media Arts Cologne and Library Centre
ofRhineland-Palatinate.Releasing catalogue data: Cologne-based libraries
to pioneer Open Data practicesCologne-based libraries and the Library
Centre ofRhineland-Palatinate (LBZ) in cooperation with the
NorthRhine-Westphalian Library Service Center (hbz) are the first
Germanlibraries to adopt the idea of Open Access for bibliographic data
bypublishing their catalog data for free public use. The University
andPublic Library of Cologne (USB), the Library of the Academy of
MediaArts Cologne, the University Library of the University of
AppliedScience of Cologne and the LBZ are taking the lead by releasing
theirdata. The Public Library of Cologne has announced to follow
shortly.The release of bibliographic data forms a basis for linking that
datawith data from other domains in the Semantic Web.
Libraries have been involved with the Open Access movement for along
time. The objective of this movement is to provide free access
toknowledge to everybody via the internet. Until now, only few
librarieshave done so with their own data. Rolf Thiele, deputy director
of theUSB Cologne, states: "Libraries appreciate the Open Access
movementbecause they themselves feel obliged to provide access to
knowledgewithout barriers. Providing this kind of access for
bibliographic data,thus applying the idea of Open Access to their own
products, has beendisregarded until now. Up to this point, it was not
possible todownload library catalogues as a whole. This will now be
possible. Weare taking a first step towards a worldwide visibility of
libraryholdings on the internet." The library of the European
Organization forNuclear Research (CERN) has already published its data
under a publicdomain license in January.
Public data is placed in the public domainThe publication of the data
enables anybody to download, modify anduse it for any purpose. "In times
in which publishers and some libraryorganisations see data primarily as
a source of capital, it isimportant to stick up for the traditional duty
of libraries andlibrarians. Libraries have always strived to make large
amounts ofknowledge accessible to as many people as possible, with the
lowestrestrictions possible," said Silke Schomburg, deputy director of
thehbz. "Furthermore libraries are funded by the public. And what
ispublicly financed should be made available to the public
withoutrestrictions," she continued.
Cooperation and data exchangie between libraries have been
firmlyestablished in the library world for more than 100 years.
Freelysupplying bibliographic data should not only further
enhancecooperation among libraries but enable subsequent use by
non-libraryinstitutions. "In the course of the internet's development it
becameclear that many services can be greatly enhanced by catalog data.
TheGerman Wikipedia for example has been enriched with German
NationalLibrary data for a long time. Such enrichment is often hindered
andconstricted by the data's half open characterData for the Semantic WebThe North Rhine-Westphalian Library Service
Center has recentlybegun evaluating the possibilities to transform data
from librarycatalogs in such a way that it can become a part of the
emergingSemantic Web. The liberalization of bibliographic data provides
thelegal background to perform this transformation in a cooperative,
open,and transparent way. Currently there are discussions with other
memberlibraries of the hbz library network to publish their data.
Moreover,"Open Data" and "Semantic Web" are topics that are gaining
perceptionin the international library world.
Further information and links to the published datasets are available at

Subject: 	Open Citations and the OKF Working Group on Open Bibliographic 
Data

Dear Jonathan,

I am writing to introduce myself as someone committed to open data, 
preferably in RDF. 

I am putting together an Open Citations project for JISC funding to 
harvest and publish millions of literature citations, of the type

    <http://example1.com/citingwork> *cito:cites*
    <http://example2.com/citedwork> .  

extracted from published life science articles by text mining and 
recorded in RDF with the help of CiTO, the Citation Typing Ontology 
(http://purl.org/net/cito/).

Since this seems of relevance to your Working Group on Open 
Bibliographic Data, I wondered if I could come and discuss this with 
you.  I will be in Cambridge 22-24 March, since I am giving the opening 
plenary at the /Integrative Bioinformatics 2010 /conference at Churchill 
College (http://www.rothamsted.bbsrc.ac.uk/bab/conf/ib2010/prog.php), 
and I wondered whether it might be convenient for me to slip away at 
some stage of the conference to meet with you in 37 Panton Street (or at 
Churchill College, or some other convenient location).

I look forward to this opportunity.

Kind regards

David

It would be interesting to see if there is any possible synergy with  
the Extensible Catalog project's metadata tools:
    http://code.google.com/p/xcmetadataservicestoolkit/

I doubt if there is direct overlap in services, but perhaps XC's set  
could funnel library data into BibCurator...

Even without knowing the fullest of details on either BibCurator nor the Bibliographic Knowledge Network Project, I can say XC's Metadata Services Toolkit (MST) is able to play a role in the development of these services. This is because, given a set of MARC-ish data, the MST provides an interface to transform, manipulate, and expose metadata in ways that is only limited by XSL technologies. Loop through sets of data and transpose first names and last names. Loop through sets of data and update plain text fields with authorized forms or pointers to URIs. Convert internal XC XML into other flavors and forms of text (XML) files. Moreover, MST implementations can be dispersed across the network -- the "cloud" -- so one MST transformation at one location/institution can be chained with another MST transformation somewhere else. Not a panacea. Not a silver bullet, but rather a useful possibility.

Hi Karen,

good post! I do have two brief comments: unfortunately the link
http://opendata.hbz-nrw.de/opendata has become invalid, it should be
http://opendata.hbz-nrw.de/. And, just to clarify things, ~5 million
bibliographic records of several cooperating libraries [(1)] have been made
available from the union catalog of the North Rhine-Westphalian Library
Service Center (hbz) on March 15. The University and City Library of Cologne
is among those libraries and already opened their local catalog data on
March 12, so that there are actually two versions of their data available
(local and from the hbz union catalog).

Cheers,

Felix

Thanks, Felix. This also clears up the question the Archive had when  
it went to download the data -- we didn't know the difference between  
the hbz data and the Koln data. I'll pass along that we should  
download both. And will add hbz to the post and fix the link.

Indeed. After we found the exports, I was put in touch with Patrick
Hochstenbach (now on this list) the man behind those exports. After a
bit of discussion he kindly agreed to relicense under the
http://opendefinition.org/ compliant ODbL.

I meant to notify the list about this but obviously must have forgotten!

I wonder if the 'resource list' ontology (http://vocab.org/resourcelist/schema) created by Nadeem Shabir and Rob Styles of Talis (http://www.talis.com/) is relevant to this? It is a RDF ontology for describing collections of items and was developed to support their Aspire product (http://www.talis.com/aspire/)

"The Resource List ontology is intended for use describing academic reading lists, bookmarks, bibliographies and similar structured collections of references."

This does indeed look very relevant. Thanks Owen for sending this over.

If anyone else has knowledge of schemas, formats or (open-source)
software relevant to creating "reading-lists"  do let us know.

A couple of related RDF schemas:

Bibo (of course) http://bibliontology.com/
AIISO - this is a bit specialist, but describes the structure of academic institutions - which is again developed at Talis and used by Aspire, and useful if you want to relate 'reading lists' to particular courses/departments etc. http://vocab.org/aiiso/schema

Other Open Source s/w for creating 'reading lists' (both in an academic context):
List8D http://blogs.kent.ac.uk/list8d/
LORLS https://lorls.lboro.ac.uk/about.html

LORLS is a bit long in the tooth, but List8D is a recent development and won prizes at both the first and second 'Developer Happiness Days' events in London (http://dev8d.org/). The most recent prize was for integrating List8D into the open source Moodle VLE.

Finally the project I'm currently working on at the Open University (TELSTAR http://www.open.ac.uk/blogs/telstar/) is about using RefWorks (a proprietary web-based reference management system) to push bibliographic/reference management tools into Moodle - although we are using RefWorks, the Moodle side of the code will be Open Source (hopefully in April), and potentially could be adapted to support other Reference Management tools.

Dear Christopher,

There has been considerable discussion, I understand, between OKF and CC 
about data licenses, which may be still ongoing.  CC is now recommending 
their "CCZero" license for datasets, since this avoids the potential 
problem of managing the "attribution stacking" that would result from 
automatic data  aggregation from several sources using conventional 
attribution licenses of any kind.  You  are advised to take these 
arguments into consideration before deciding what to do for EPrints.

For FlyTED (http://www.fly-ted.org), which as you know uses the EPrints 
software platform, we have, after discussions with John Wilbanks, 
adopted CCZero licenses for metadata and thumbnails, and normal CC 
attribution licences for high resolution images.

Dryad (http://datadryad.org/repo), which is a repository for datasets 
linked to journal articles, has also adopted CCZero licenses.

I must say here that here at the OKF we really don't think that
attribution-stacking is an issue.

We are also consider attribution-sharealike type licenses as "open" --
and Open Data Commons, which is an OKF supported project, produces
such licenses. There is a ongoing, lengthy and friendly disagreement

Maybe I should just teach the controversy then?

The decision for our local RDF data will have to be made "above my pay 
grade". But I'll try to frame it as between public domain, -by and 
-by-nocommercial

I'm about to do the first RDF release of the software and today we are 
running a training course in EPrints & Linked data at Southampton. Any 
suggestions welcome! I'll happily add more suggested licenses to the 
default release of the software, and a link to the discussion too!

Partly, though, the data consuming community will need to nag each admin 
to add a license as EPrints 3.2.1 will provide RDF out of the box, but 
the license will not appear until they pick one.

David,

Thanks for copying me on this.

It's obviously up to E-Prints, but I'd encourage them to look at the 
Panton Principles, onto which both Creative Commons and OKF staff 
signed. They recommend using the public domain (either via a CCZero tool 
or the OKF's PDDL) on publicly funded science data, and it'd be a lost 
opportunity to encode PP-compliant principles into a piece of software 
that will likely contain a lot of publicly funded science data.

I'd also point out that data license regimes that impose share-alike on 
data can create expectations that 1) conflict with privacy restraints on 
data, which often exist on publicly funded scientific data sets 
(anything touching a human subject, for example) and 2) depend on the 
act of *copying*  - in a semantic web world, query is the dominant 
regime, rather than a copy. Last, of course, any contract regime that 
depends on contract carries the burden of the derivative database 
providers making a contract offer and the users agreeing to the 
contract, which over time can impose significant transaction costs.

All of these went into the CC work on data licensing and the public 
domain, and are reflected in the panton principles. We've done quite a 
bit of legwork and legal analysis of the risks and benefits and would be 
happy to brief you at your leisure. We arrived at our position after 
three years of research, and after beginning with a real desire to 
implement a share-alike regime for data.

All good, but what guidance should we put in the default config file? 
I'll happily put some links in, but I'm only beginning to get engaged 
with the "Open" community. (as oppose to the lower-case-o open)

As I understand it, this is a license for the eprints *metadata* not
on scientific data itself. The Panton Principles are focused on the
licensing of the data associated to (publicly-funded) research.

In general, our primary recommendation is that data (any kind of data)
be open as specified by http://opendefinition.org/. Being open in this
sense includes public domain (e.g. CCZero or the PDDL) but also allows
for attribution and sharealike type licenses -- the important point is
that we can allow attribution and sharealike and still have
interoperability.

Obviously a PD approach places the fewest restrictions on re-users but
one also has to think about the providers of the data here. For many
people providing data attribution or sharealike provisions may be
things they really want and which make the difference between them
providing data and not providing it. (and community norms, IMO, don't
make a real difference here [1]).

[1]: http://blog.okfn.org/2009/02/02/open-data-openness-and-licensing/

For example, I've heard from several providers of bibliographic data
that they are especially concerned about sharing-back especially by
commercial players in the sector. This is a legitimate concern.
Share-alike providers a really valuable option here in simultaneously
addressing this concern but not excluding commercial use (which could
be very useful and important).

I would also note that for many "grass-roots" projects sharealike also
seems to be important with many of the most well-know grass-roots
"open" projects using sharealike licenses (linux kernel, wikipedia,
open street map etc).

In the case of the Panton Principles they are dealing with "data
related to published science", especially science that is publicly
funded. In this area, the case for having absolutely minimal
restrictions on reusers is a strong one (the science is already
getting up-front funded by the state). This is why, at least from the
OKF point of view, the Panton Principles go on from a basic
recommendation of openness (principles 1-3) to an explicit
recommendation of public domain only in principle 4.

Here, we are talking about bibliographic metadata which is outside the
scope of the PP.

Share-alike can clearly have problems with privacy restraints -- or
with any other constraints such as people wishing to proprietize the
data :)

In any case we are basically talking about bibliographic data here
where privacy rights really aren't ever going to be an issue.

I'm a little unclear about this query versus copy issue and why
share-alike has a problem here.

I'm not sure of the relevance of this comment. Almost all licenses
whether they are normal CC ones for content or Open Data Commons one's
for data have an element of contract in them, at least in common law
jurisdictions. See, for example, this comment from Mia Garlick (who
was CC's general counsel):

http://lists.ibiblio.org/pipermail/cc-licenses/2006-April/003504.html

ODC licenses may be more explicit about this but they aren't really
any different.

As John knows we don't share these views on licensing of data, at
least in general :) For more on this see:

As I understand it, you are dealing with the licensing of what is in
essence bibliographic metadata. As such my main recommendation is that
you do pretty much what you were doing already :) That is you offer
users the three main "open" license choices for data:

Public Domain: PDDL or CCZero
Attribution: ODC-by - "http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/";
Attribution-Sharealike: ODbL - "http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/";

Do the latter two ODC licenses purport to impose contract terms that go further
than copyright?  That's one problem I had with them as I understood them when
they were announced; I really don't like the principle that any download
or use of data binds me to requirements that copyright law itself does not.

I'm currently licensing my ~40,000 bibliographic records for free online books
with CC-BY-SA.  I realize that the SA requirements could be removed where
record data is reused under fair use and public domain provisions, and I'm fine
with that.  (For instance, at least some of the bibliographic fields
are very likely to be public domain by US standards.)  I wouldn't want to
switch to a similar ODC license that tried to include contractual
restrictions for uses that are currently permitted by our copyright law.

(Actually, I'm considering going to CC-0, which would simplify things
further, but how to get approval for that in my organization isn't
entirely clear.)

Actually, getting a guide to how to get an organisation to decide would 
be a huge win.

Teaching the controversy is the best joke this running argument's had in ages!

As rufus noted, we do have a long time and lively, but friendly,
disagreement on these issues. I'm getting ready to hop onto a very
long flight and don't have time to compose a proper answer, but will
hammer out what I can.

Short version: data isn't the same as data isn't the same as data, and
it's unclear whether metadata are data. In many cases it simply
depends on the eye of the beholder. The SC protocol was a little
closed-minded on this front, and the PP are a recognition of that
(moving back to should from must in prescribing the public domain). In
some kinds of metadata (ontologies and such), we've tended to
encourage treating them as regular copyrightable object rather than
data - thus, when we talked to the New York Times about their news
vocabulary, they used CC BY rather than a data tool like CC0.  See
http://data.nytimes.com for an example of releasing a SKOS vocabulary.

But, when we look at library bibliographic data, we do tend to think
that data is itself not copyrightable, and encourage a panton
principles approach (as the University of Cologne adopted last week,
for example, in releasing 5.4M database records under PP-comliant
terms. http://www.hbz-nrw.de/dokumentencenter/presse/pm/datenfreigabe_engl

The semantic web thing will take me more time, but the short version
of that is: copyright licenses are triggered by the making of a copy
or a substantial extraction. Semantic web works by lots and lots of
tiny extractions creating lots and lots of aggregated resources.
Either you force everyone involved to replicate your licensing regime
for uses not contemplated by the licenses (i.e., no copying or
"substantial" extraction was involved, but since the end result is
that a thousands machines combing the data web can end up
re-assembling your data, you ask for rights on every query returned
out of the system) or you create a false perception that the data are
"protected" by the license. The NYT fellows started out thinking
share-alike was what they wanted, but after they went to see TimBL, he
sent them down the path of imposing less restrictions because it makes
for a better web of linked data if you don't have to add licensing
rules to every triple.

As with all things technical, your mileage may vary, and the important
thing in the end is that Rufus and I do agree on the most important
thing - sharing data is essential, however you do it.
