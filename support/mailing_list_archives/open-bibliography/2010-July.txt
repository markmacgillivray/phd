Agreed that book is not an unambiguous term even in daily usage, and also
agreed that most people find it helpful to think about 'books' and dropping
the term would be more confusing.

Probably my main concern is (as noted in my previous mail) that the first
part of the definition 'A book is a written work or a collection of written
works in book form.', is contradicted by other parts of the definition.

One of the nice things about FRBR is it is not limited to Works
in book form -- it can include musical recordings, paintings,
and other things that are not normally considered to be books
and would be confusing if they were called books. I think that
Work is sufficiently clear and that it is not unnatural for people
to think of books as works.

Beyond that, if we want to get deeper into using OWL perhaps
it is appropriate to do something like,

:Work a owl:Class .
:Book owl:subClassOf :Work .
:Performance owl:subClassOf :Work .
:Painting owl:subClassOf :Work .

Cheers,

For what it's worth, I think people can err in setting up a
hard-and-fast system. The library world loves binary systems and
deciding things at the start, not down the road.

For example, a book either does or does not get the LCSH "Man-Woman
Relations." This is strange, as about 90% of literature involves
man-woman relationships to some degree or another. (Tagging, which
allows for degree, is an improvement in this respect.) I would argue
this sort of relationship has more to do with the physical constraints
of catalog cards than anything else.

This idea was extended to FRBR, which involves another set of binary
understandings about relationships. The real world is much more
nuanced. We have, for example, two basic texts of Hamlet, with neither
one being original or the "parent" of the other. The history of works
on LibraryThing is replete with more recent examples. The relationship
between two books is a matter of degree, perspective and intended use.

LibraryThing's solution is to have two layers. The first is a catalog
layer, in which things are stored atomically and almost without
schema. The second is a global layer, which either bubbles up from the
catalog data or is imposed upon it. Either way, the global layer is
understood to be a convenient abstraction, and susceptible to change.
We should remember that classification is largely about imposing
structure for a purpose, not finding structure and telling the truth
about it.

The digital world allows for a richer conception. So it's a shame
library science and the semantic web people are too often drawn to
arrows, trees and buckets.

Even outside the constraints of catalog cards, it's often considered
a good idea to leave out "Man-woman relationships" or other subject
descriptors that cover a large portion of a collection, in order to
prevent overload when people go looking for books under that heading.

I didn't take formal cataloger training, but my understand is that
traditionally, you're only supposed to add a subject heading when it's
both a primary and a distinctive characteristic of a work, as opposed
to something that just happens to be featured in it at some level.
The idea is that, when you look up the heading, you should find the books
that are most centrally and definitively about man-women relationships
in your collection, not all the books in your collection that happen
to include men and women relating to each other somewhere in the text.
You can see the usefulness of this kind of policy if you're specifically
trying to do focused research on a previously defined topic.

This is a different use case than you often see in tag-based browsing,
though, where the purpose of subject descriptors isn't so much to
draw your attention to a particular focus, but instead to filter
a large collection into a smaller collection.  (In browsing scenarios
like this, you're not asking "show me the books most concerned with
man-woman relationships", but instead "show me your collection,
filtering out the books that *don't* deal at all
with man-women relationships".)

Of course, in social systems like LibraryThing, you can also draw
attention to particular places in that filter via tag frequencies.  But
that might not quite what a scholarly researcher wants.  "Show me the
books that the most people have associated with man-woman relationships"
tends to filter for popularity more than "show me the books that
are *concerned* most with man-woman relationships".  ("Relationships" might
not be the best example, because this topic is a bit diffuse to begin
with; but the difference is starker when you have a topic that's
featured briefly in many popular works, but deeply in only a few,
more obscure works.)

So there really are two subtly different purposes for subject descriptors
in large catalogs.  Moreover, the "distinctiveness" criterion in the
traditional purpose is *necessarily* dependent on the collection that
it's in; what's distinctive in one collection may be completely commomplace
in another.

One consequence of this is that if you're trying to compose together a large
open collection from a bunch of smaller pre-existing collections, you're
going to have to deal sensibly with the different purposes and contexts
where subject headings have been assigned.  And, hopefully, try to come
up with workable strategies and policies going forward.

I see this as presenting problems for federated searching. Less so for  
books but definitely for journal articles, the context provides some  
subject clues. I would guess that the Journal of Microbiology doesn't  
tag all of its articles with the term "microbiology" since that is  
assumed. But if you combine this journal with many others and do a  
search on "microbiology" you may miss all of the ones in this journal.

To me, this is not a fault so much of indexing but of the concept of  
searching -- that we enter one or more search terms and get back a  
result set, as if that is sufficient to define your area of interest.  
In fact, you might be interested in the intersection of a number of  
different topics, something searching doesn't really facilitate. I  
might want man-woman relationships combined with microbiology or  
whaling, but it's not easy to get there given what we have in our  
metadata. We need to be able to navigate fuzzy sets, oddball  
connections, and the interesting outlooks of other readers. This means  
that we need to connect man-woman relationships to all of the works  
where that is relevant, so that I can navigate that aspect of the work  
in combination with others. I think the use of facets helps with this;  
helps us chunk and refine and follow.

Subject: [open-bibliography] MARC Codes for Forms of Musical Composition
Message-ID: <AANLkTil7K4HjYD_xpdI4eagn9H8YQpxmhLHop1Bla8u6@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

I just wanted to let people know I've made the MARC codes for forms of
musical compositions (
http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/marcmuscomp.html) available as
http://purl.org/ontology/mo/Genres.

http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/

They follow the same naming convention as they would in the MARC 008 or 047,
so it's easy to map (that is, no lookup needed) from your MARC data:

http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/sy#genre

etc.

The RDF is available as well:
http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/sy.rdf


I'd love any feedback/suggestions/corrections/etc.

Also, you can look around to see MARC country codes, geographic area codes
and language codes.  Eventually I would like to get all of the MARC codes
(not already modeled by LC) in there (
http://www.loc.gov/standards/valuelist/).

Thanks,
-Ross.

The rule of three came about during the catalog card era, and was
maintained after, but your argument does hold up as far as it goes. In
doing so, however, I think we can see that classification is done for
a reason, and generally in the context of a specific--and rapidly
obsolete--use case. It is so very easy to slip into the notion that
classification is something more than that?something simply true and
appropriate to every context and use.

Well, yes and no. You can only see that if you presume the term is
binary. Google has indexed 78 million pages with the word "CNN" in
them, but when I search for it, it knows not to give me everything, in
accession order, as most library systems would. It knows that
"CNN"-ness is a number, or even an array, not a boolean.

Similarly, something like 25,000 works on LibraryThing have been
tagged "chick lit," but the top ones are really, really good examples
of it.

For more of this sort of thinking, see my YouTube conference video,
"What's the big deal about tagging?" on YouTube
http://www.youtube.com/user/librarythingtim#p/u/12/Ok7YinIhT0Y.

There is something to what you say. Popularity will always be a
factor, but not so simply as you say. It is trivial to "factor out"
popularity--to ask not what books are most often chick lit overall,
but what books are most often tagged chick lit, norming for
popularity.

In the case of tags, LibraryThing doesn't factor popularity out.* But
factoring out popularity is absolutely basic to all such algorithms.
If we didn't do it, the top recommendations for almost every book
would be something by J. K. Rowling because, statistically, those are
the books with the highest overlap, even for books of a completely
different kind. The problem therefore presents itself as a lack of
data. You can't put a book first in chick lit because a single person
said so and it is the only tag it received (thus being "100% about
chick lit!").

True. All I really want is for people to understand such decisions are
about the purposes and contexts, and that these contexts are by no
means guaranteed to be useful in the future.

Tim

*The results weren't better or more interesting, they were just
confusing to people. The normed "salience" of a tag is, however,
visible in which tags are bold in a tag cloud.

appropriate to every context and use.
</snip>

The purpose of assigning a specific classification number to an item has not really ever been because it is more "true" or "appropriate" than any other number. Catalogers have known since Day 1 that most resources that are even halfway complex in their subjects can easily be placed in 3 or 4 places within the classification system they are using, plus catalogers are aware that there are many different classifications in the world, some of them quite different in how they arrange their subjects. The most widely used in the library world are the Dewey Decimal, the Library of Congress, the Universal Decimal, but there are many others, some of them aimed only to a single institution.

So, the purpose of assigning a classification number is to provide a level of predictability to an item, or in other words, a bit of standardization. The purpose of classification (as well as assignment of all headings) is to *bring the same things together*, so much as possible. Why?

Because otherwise, people will have to look around in different places for resources on the same topic. I went into more detail on this in an article I wrote on my former website several years ago and it is still available in the internet archive: 
http://web.archive.org/web/20020406052541/http://www.princeton.edu/~jamesw/mdata/MetadataCreation.html (the images don't seem to have survived, as happens so often in the Archive, but maybe they aren't so important to understand the ideas there)

Therefore I do not assign a call number to an item because I "like" it or I feel it is "best"; people who do this often make huge mistakes (and I have seen this happening more and more as training of catalogers goes by the wayside), rather I must find similar items and assign the same numbers, whether I happen to like them or not. This same thing occurs for assigning controlled vocabulary (Rome vs. Roma, Tolstoy vs. Tolstoi, etc.). There are many headings I have assigned that I think are absolutely stupid, but since I am a cataloger, it is my job to assign those headings and not those that conform more to my own taste. 

In terms of classification, the task is the same: to assign a controlled "relative location" within a specific collection, thereby making the resource more predictable for others to find--often this "other person" can only be another expert in the classification. Still, it is predictable.

Problems with assigning classification numbers have been known since the days of the Library of Alexandria. Many of these problems may not be relevant today with virtual materials and more powerful systems. 

We should also realize and use the so-called "syndetic structure" buried in the arrangement of the subject headings. For example, "Love" in the LC subject headings is in the arrangement:

Psychology
->Emotions
-->Love
--->Courtship
---->Marriage proposals
----->Mate selection
This final heading then has related terms for 
Man-woman relationships, and 
Marriage brokerage.

We see a "classification system" at work here. There are lots and lots and lots of other references and notes within all of this structure, and it seems to me as if this could be incredibly useful and highly popular if more advantage were made from it.

[BTW, the rule of three deals with assignment of name headings and not with subjects]

Thanks, Ross. I looked at the RDA terms [1] and interestingly type of  
composition isn't one of the vocabularies that was defined in RDA. I  
don't know whether that was an oversight or not -- type of composition  
is included in the RDA rules, there's just no list to accompany it. So  
this one may end up doing double duty: MARC and RDA.

We'll make a more formal announcement later, but we've decided to make 
the ECS EPrints repository eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk have a completely 
open RDF license. (CC0). This also covers our other "departmental 
infrastructure RDF" such as projects, people, etc.

It does *not* cover eprints.soton.ac.uk (the main university EPrints 
repository), which moves more slowly and carefully. It does *not* cover 
the documents in the repository.

I think our license is please-attribute: We don't make any legal 
requirement on you to do so, but it'd be nice if you could attribute our 
data to us, unless it's a bother in which case don't worry about it.

Hopefully this will help other places make the case for opening up data, 
where appropriate.

Another thought... how hard would it be do create entries for all of  
the MARC codes in this way? I have them all in a database (and in this  
[1] tab-delimited file, with documentation [2]). I could easily create  
files with code-tab-display for each. Also, at [2] there is a link to  
the MARC language codes, which I believe are slightly different to the  
ISO codes, but in any case would be useful for translating MARC to RDF.

Karen,

At http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/ there are MARC language codes, geographic
area codes and country codes.

I would like to add all of the codes that LC doesn't get to first.

The http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/sy.rdf example assumes OWL
Full. 

http://www.mygrid.org.uk/OWL/Validator

I think it would be better as OWL DL. This could be done by separating
the various types into separate identities using hash URIs. If anyone is
interested, I could amend the example to show how.

As a rule, I like using OWL DL better than OWL Full because my brain
doesn't fall out nearly as often.

Hi Jeff,

I'm not sure exactly why Ross' file is OWL Full, at least in the OWL 1 sense. In the validator you point to, I get the following output:


>     * Untyped Object Property: http://umbel.org/umbel#isAbout
>     * Untyped Object Property: http://purl.org/ontology/mo/wikipedia

>     * Untyped Individual: http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh85131473#concept
>     * Untyped Individual: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony


It could be a aide effect of that specific validator's implementation, which expects all ontological data to be present in the source at validation time--remember that we're checking instance data here, while the primary purpose of this validator is, I expect, ontologies.
Maybe if Ross had pulled the definitions for all the above constructs in his file, the problem would have vanished.

Note that if you want to validate against the latest OWL2-DL, you can use http://owl.cs.manchester.ac.uk/validator/
I've tried it, and it gives roughly the same results: in OWL2-DL you also have to declare explicitly the resources that you're using...

Cheers,

Antoine

It would help me if anyone could briefly summarise what they have been / are
doing and how this can relate to the OKF Open Bibliography work - in
particular where we can each feed off the work of the other. I'd imagine,
for example, that OKF are more likley to get involved in particular
vocabularies and in collaborative instances (e.g. crowdsourcing)

On a question of usage, would it be practical to have the MARC  
2-letter code as a value in the RDF? After all, that is what is the  
value in the MARC record. If one were to turn MARC into linked data,  
the linking element would be the code. I realize that in the ideal  
world the MARC2RDF would use the URI provided here, but ... Perhaps  
either an altLabel or hiddenLabel?

Also, there is a German translation, which I can pass along if you  
have the time to add them.

Karen, you're right, adding the actual code would be useful (the assumption
of URIs being opaque and all).  This would also be useful for SPARQL queries
(which what I've done here currently doesn't support, but can and should and
will).

Not sure of the best predicate -- maybe skos:notation?  Anyone have a strong
opinion on this?

I would love the German translation (and any other translations, as well!).
 Is it for all of the MARC codes?

-Ross.

Jeff, which resources have multiple rdf:types?  Of the muscomps, they should
all only be mo:Genre.

On this page:
   http://www.d-nb.de/standardisierung/formate/marc21.htm

the first item under Deutsche Ubersetzung is a PDF that is a  
translation of MARC21 into German. It has all of the MARC fixed field  
codes. Unfortunately, it is a PDF, so if anyone knows of a more  
malleable version, please speak up.

I was under the impression that in German speaking
countries they used MAB and not MARC. Is this not
correct? (Not that it's a bad thing to have translations
of MARC anyways)

I think it is perfectly valid to have multiple types. At the
very minimum everything is an rdfs:Resource whether
stated explicitly or not. If something breaks when it is
explicitly stated because it doesn't like multiple types I
think that something is itself broken...

They're moving from MAB to MARC, mainly because the primary  
commercially available library systems use MARC.

My question was more based on the fact that I don't think anything should
have explicitly set multiple rdf:types in there.

If so, I'm curious to what they are.

I think in general it's not necessary to set any rdf:types. The resource
turns into a particular type during interpreting a particular property.
But setting rdf:types is important in cases using new specified and not
standard compliant properties (i.e. extensions to SKOS)

 

Regarding the German translation of MARC 21:

First of all, last year we changed to MARC 21 as German interchange
format, so MAB is gone...

I already asked a colleague if we have a kind of table representation
just comprising the code translations...more information comes up soon!


 

Cheers, Alexander

Hallo,
 
I'd like to remind everybody that today the working group will have its first virtual meeting on 16:00 UK time (world time map: http://www.weltzeit.de/zeitzonenkarte.php). See this etherpad for the agenda: http://okfnpad.org/Qv1jMMQL1h 

Everybody is invited to join. As ten people have already announced their participation on the etherpad, we'll use IRC as medium of communication. The channel is #okfn on irc.oftc.net. You can connect via a standard IRC client or via the Mibbit web client by clicking http://ur1.ca/4fh and entering a nickname.

Yes we definitely want to do calls in future but:

  (i) We've found Skype doesn't scale well to 8+ people.
  (ii) Conference call facilities are expensive for participants (e.g.
0.10 Euro/min x 60 = 6 EUR is not uncommon!).

We're asking around about possible sponsorship for OKF to foot the
bill for regular conference call facilities. If anyone has any ideas
or is able to donate infrastructure for this call -- please say! ;-)

	7th October 2010
Message-ID: <AANLkTilmwY8wDnSh6iFPIM1tqQeAnKEfu8o2dkLnvwQY@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a quick note to let you know that we're currently organising an
international open bibliographic data workshop / hackday at the Freie
Universit?t Berlin on 7th October 2010.

This will be very much focused on discussion and 'getting things done'
-- rather than presentations per se. Key thing is to get interested
folks together! Some ideas for things I'd be keen to see:

  * discussion / drafting for a 'manual' for opening up bibliographic data
  * discussion of the role of bibliographic data to help determine
which works are in the public domain in which countries (to build
services like publicdomainworks.net)
  * discussion / hacking on key technologies -- e.g. versioning for
data, RDF, data stores, user services, ...
  * future of open bibliographic data -- what services people would
like to see (e.g. using data as backbone for new kinds of research
tools in digital humanities, representing data on maps/timelines)
  * open bibliographic data / LOD
  * add things here! ;-)

Would be most grateful if folks could indicate their
interest/availability on the following link so we get a clearer idea
about numbers:

This will be a satellite event to the The 3rd Free Culture Research
Conference on 8-9th October:

Okay for now I would suggest we use IRC as main 'assembly point' and
Skype on an ad hoc basis if someone has fast/solid connection.
Definitely have learnt the hard way that if you count on Skype and
then it doesn't scale properly it can be very frustrating (people
dropping out, can't hear anything, big delays, constantly dialling
people in, etc)!

I thought this recent news about the Knowledge for All project might
be of interest:

  Hot Type: Canadian University Hopes to Lead Fight Against High
Subscription Prices
  http://chronicle.com/article/Canadian-University-Hopes-to/66095/?key=QWN0JAc8ZXMfZ3AyKSBKeHZUb3UrIx5xPSVEYngaZVBT

There seem to be an increasing amount of interest in bibliographic
information on the web, such as the beginnings of a 'Citation Commons'
being promoted by JISC and SURF?

  Open Access for UK Research - JISC?s contributions
  http://www.jisc.ac.uk/publications/programmerelated/2010/openaccessmainbrochure.aspx

It would be great if we could all somehow work together on this. But
perhaps it would be better to all share data in similar ways and let a
thousand distributed, bibliographic flowers bloom?

Thanks Ed!

I'm hoping that we can go with the distributed option (flowers
blooming) but also encourage collaboration by:

  (i) inviting relevant folks to this group/list
  (ii) building community via monthly calls and annual/biannual events

Also promoting open bibliographic data at national library/policy
level, via research funding bodies, etc will be important. And to do
this effectively it will be valuable to continue to collate compelling

The Library Linked Data W3C Incubator Group just started up a couple
months ago. So far the meetings have largely been oriented around
getting the working group members acquainted, and starting to document
some use cases for linked data in libraries [1]. More details about
the group can be found in the incubator group charter [2]. It's my
understanding that the incubator group will last 1 year, and after
that they'll evaluate whether there is more work to be done in the
area.

We've seen some major national libraries releasing bibliographic
linked data (Sweden, Germany, Hungary, US) and there is a desire to
see if we can come up with some best practices to enable
interoperability. It's also important that the various parties talk to
each other, and coordinate activities if possible.

William Waites of OKFN and several other open-bibliography
participants are LLD members...so hopefully we'll see some good
interplay between the two groups. In particular I think the okfn
effort is better situated to put some of the ideas into practice,
which will provide extremely valuable feedback.

The LLD has a public discussion list [3], and I encourage you all to
subscribe if you have the extra bandwidth.

Hi,

Once you bring OWL into the picture, every resource has rdf:type
owl:Thing in addition to any defined rdf:type. Any rdfs:Class (C) that
is rdfs:subClassOf another class (C') implies that every instance of
type C is also of type C'. I would argue that a resource with multiple
(implied) rdf:type(s) is the rule, not the exception.

Let me address Ross' question before attempting to argue that restraint
to a single rdf:type is good practice.

 

Here is the example in question:

 

http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/sy.rdf

 

The owl:sameAs property asserts that these two URIs identify "the same
thing" (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def):

 

http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/sy#genre

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony

 

The 1st URI responds with this statement:

 

<http://purl.org/NET/marccodes/muscomp/sy#genre> rdf:type
<http://purl.org/ontology/mo/Genre>

 

The 2nd URI responds with this:

 

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony> rdf:type
<http://sw.opencyc.org/2008/06/10/concept/Mx4rwSmVfJwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA> 

<http://dbpedia.org/resource/Symphony> rdf:type
<http://sw.opencyc.org/2008/06/10/concept/Mx4rvcNktpwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA> 

 

Other rdf:type and owl:sameAs assertions cascade from there in dbpedia.

 

The following document isn't authoritative, but it discusses some of the
confusion surrounding owl:sameAs and may also help us sort out the
issues: 

 

http://www.w3.org/2009/12/rdf-ws/papers/ws21. 

 

Here is a quote:

 

"However, owl:sameAs does have a particular semantics of individual
identity, namely that the two individuals are exactly the same and so
share all the same properties." (original emphasis).

 

Since rdf:type is a property, I assume that an OWL reasoner should back
me up in my claim that Ross' example has multiple rdf:types. I just
downloaded Pellet and will report on the results once I figure out how
to run it. Hopefully, it will demonstrate how "share" involving
owl:sameAs plays out in practice.

My question was more based on the fact that I don't think anything
should have explicitly set multiple rdf:types in there.

 

If so, I'm curious to what they are.

I think it is perfectly valid to have multiple types. At the
very minimum everything is an rdfs:Resource whether
stated explicitly or not. If something breaks when it is
explicitly stated because it doesn't like multiple types I
think that something is itself broken...

Hello everybody,

I am sending you the minutes of the yesterday's first virtual meeting of the OKFN Working Gropu on Open Bibliographic Data. It went quite well with using chat and etherpad and I think the meeting was very successfull. Thanks to all participants. We worked on a number of points and would appreciate everybody on the list sharing their thoughts and suggestions.

On the etherpad (http://okfnpad.org/Qv1jMMQL1h) you'll find the minutes as well as the chatlog and additional informations on upcoming events and topics not discussed. Feel free to add and edit if I missed something. (E.G. I think not all participants are listed...)

Cheers
Adrian


1st virtual meeting of the OKFN Working Group for Open Bibliographic Data

Date: July, 6th 2010, 16:00 UK time (BST)

Channels: 

Meet on IRC (see: <http://okfn.org/contact>). If less than 8 people we'll  try Skype. Meeting results will be gathered on this etherpad.

Participants

- Adrian Pohl (moderation)
- Rufus Pollock (actual moderation ;-)
- Thomas Krichel
- Felix Ostrowski
- Peter Murray-Rust 
- Karen Coyle 
- Micah Altman
- Ed Summers
- William Waites
- John Mark Ockerbloom
- Ross Singer
- Ben O'Steen

Apologies

- Tim Hubbard (but can't join until 17.00 at earliest)
- MJ Ray (software.coop, but on prior engagement for another co-op)


Agenda
======

1. Gathering updates and news about Open Bibliographic Data / guest blog posts on OKFN blog

2. Open Data Flyer (http://wiki.okfn.org/Open%20Bibliographic%20Data%20Flyer ).

3. Open Data Charter
  
4.  Open bibliographic data  workshop, Berlin, 7th October 2010

5. usage of  open-bibliography   mailing list

6. Regular virtual meetings


Minutes
=======

1. Gathering updates and news about Open Bibliographic Data

We looked for a tag for open bibliography related sources to be share via different platforms (twitter, delicious etc.).

The following suggestions were made and voted for:

      * obib: -1 -1
      * openbiblio: +1 +1 +1 +1 +1  -1 (10 chars!) <-- dead sourceforge project by same name
      * openbibliodata: +0
      * openbib:  +1  <-- live software project by same name
      * obid: -1 +1 +1
      * openbibdata: +0
      * obd: -1

Obviously, openbiblio got the most votes. What does erverybody else think?

Guest blog posts on OKFN blog about projects and thoughts on open bibliographic data are always welcome. Everybody is invited to contribute.
  

2. Open Data Flyer

See this thread for background: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-May/000076.html 

We launched a Pad version of the flyer for ease of collaborative editing here: http://okfnpad.org/bibliography-flyer 

ACTIONS: 
* Optimizing, layouting, printing and distributing it (Karen Coyle said she could try to do something more  "designed".)
* Aim: one page A4
* Designing an image/logo? Suggestions?
      * AP: I am thinking about data with wings... But how do you draw data?
      * Could reuse open data buttons merging them with something bibliographic?
         --> http://opendefinition.org/buttons/ 
* Re-translating to German. Translations to other languages?


3. Open Data Charter
Background: See the proposal on the mailing list: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-June/000209.html 

This charter should be written short and simple. It should suggest a basic set of open data principles for library data. E.g. like Panton Principles (http://pantonprinciples.org/). Could also aim to get sign on/support from key people in libraries, archives, etc.

See also: http://wiki.okfn.org/FutureOfBibliographicControl 

ACTION: put up pad/wiki page and arrange a 15/30m sprint to get a core set out. Could reuse some of flyer and already have a good basis.


4.  Open bibliographic data workshop, Berlin, 7th October 2010
    * Details at: http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-July/000253.html 
      * Please participate in the Doodle poll to find out who can participate: http://doodle.com/nrnssh36zty7wc98 
     

5. usage of  open-bibliography  mailing list

Felix Ostrowski brought this up "hoping not to have too many discussions on frbr here :-)"
Basically, participants agreed that FRBR discussions should be limited but can't be avoided completely. William Waites reminded of the existence of openbiblio-dev for software and implementation details. openbiblio-dev list was  launched, see http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-July/000253.html for details.


6. Regular virtual meetings
     * Date, time: We agreed on sticking to the first tuesday of the month, 16:00 UK time. Is this OK with everybody else?
     * Adrian is trying to send a reminder before every meeting. (I'm on holiday during the next date & will ask Felix to do that.)
     * tools
       * The chat/etherpad combination worked quite well so we'll use this duo as long as more than eight people join the meeting.
       * There were some objections to skype because it is not open. The OKFN is seeking for alternatives, see http://lists.okfn.org/pipermail/open-bibliography/2010-July/000251.html 
    

6b. Extra: Updates from the W3C incubator group on linked library data (lld-xg)

We agreed on getting updates about the work of the lld-xg at each virtual meeting. For infos about this group see http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/.
Participants of this W3C group who are also in the OKFN Openbiblio group are:
* Karen Coyle
* William Waites
* Ross Singer
* Ed Summers

BTW, Jodi Schneider set up a twitter list of lld-xg participants: http://twitter.com/jschneider/lldxg-members 


7. Items not covered on which we may hold a skype call. Please add name if interested:

  1. discussing the  future of bibliographic data sharing (e.g. Z39.50, web services, MARC21, MARCXML)
      * kc; isn't this the whole banana? we need to break it down into manageable chunks
        * Agree. Do you want to suggest a breakdown :)
        kc:i'm organizing the topic list for the lld wg -- i think that will give us an outline. will share when done

Another way to handle this is to not use generic dct:identifiers
like this. Instead use subProperties:

personid rdfs:subPropertyOf dct:identifier .
conceptid rdfs:subPropertyOf dct:identifier .

Talino_Manu personid 123 .
Talino_Manu conceptid 456 .

{ ?sub rdfs:subProperty ?super . ?thing ?sub ?obj } =>
{ ?thing ?super ?obj } .


Think of the {A} =>  {B} (read => as "implies)  as analogous
to a constraint or trigger in a relational database.
 
A generic search would use dct:identifier. Something that knew
about or implemented foaf:Person or skos:Concept in particular.
So,

SELECT ?thing WHERE { ?thing dct:identifier 123 }
SELECT ?person WHERE { ?person personid 123 }
SELECT ?concept WHERE { ?concept conceptid 456 }

Would all work as expected.

This can be mirrored in the object model that doesn't really
need to support multiple inheritance. You might do something
like this in Python, for example:

class Person(Graph):
	def mail(self, from_addr, message):
		from smtplib import SMTP
		s = SMTP()
		addrs = self.objects(self.identifier, FOAF["mbox"])
		s.sendmail(from_addr, addrs, message)

class Concept(Graph):
	def concepts(self):
		yield self
		for parent in self.objects(self.identifier, SKOS["subConceptOf"]):
			yield Concept(identifier=parent.identifier)

Two hopefully quick points:

After the massive FRBR thread, I came away with the notion that Work and
Expression are redundant levels, and that by redrawing the lines between
the layers and adding in more verbs we could better serve the aim of
FRBR'ising the records.

So... where are the verbs? I've been moving house etc so haven't
followed the threads as close as I'd like, but I do think this is a
perfect opportunity to collaborate on a list of verbs that interrelates
the classes that remain - the new 'Work', 'Manifestation' and 'Item'

Shall we kick off an etherpad for this? or has someone already started
collating predicates and I am just behind the times?

--------------------

Electronic Items

Item doesn't make an awful lot of sense with regards electronics or
born-digital items. I think that we might broaden the schema a little
here to allow something like an OAI-ORE Aggregation here instead of an
Item. Would it be preferable to subclass it as 'DigitalItem' or to use
it unaltered?

This would enable us to describe whatever granularity of digital item we
want or are able to using RDF relationships.

The *Open* Bibliographic Data Working Group of the *Open* Knowledge

http://sipphone.com/conference/ might work for this group but I've not
tested how far it scales.  Use sip:1222xxxxxxx at proxy01.sipphone.com
URLs for other SIP phones and regular phones might be able to call in
on http://www.sipbroker.com/sipbroker/action/pstnNumbers with prefix

Thanks - I wasn't quite clear in hindsight. These predicates apply to
the Work, Expression, Manifestation and Item hierarchy and have tight
range and domain constraints as prescribed by the FRBR model.

I was talking about realining or adding to the predicates when you take
into consideration that some Expression-level predicates are arguably
Work level relationships (or should be): eg translations and so on. For
example, changing the range+domain of
http://metadataregistry.org/schemaprop/show/id/1635.html
(hasATranslation) from Expression to perhaps a union of Expression and
Work? or simply from E -> E to W -> W?

(predicate codified into RDF here:
http://vocab.org/frbr/core.html#translation)

Do we have a list of relationships where the range and domain need to be
loosened, based on previous discussions? Will we require more
relationships to describe the Works properly?

Speaking with my desk-neighbour at the university who is
a reseacher in compilers, he thinks the notion of congruence
closure will be useful in an implementation that tries to deal
with owl:sameAs. You might pull in descriptions of everything
in the graph described by owl:sameAs relationships, pick
one (perhaps at random) to be canonical (within the program),
move all properties to that one and treat the others as
indirections.

Only if people really mean owl:sameAs when they  say
owl:sameAs though...

I think there's actually a deep philosophical problem that
underlies the gulv between dfs:seeAlso and owl:sameAs.
It's easy to assert identity and it's easy to assert similarity
in an undefined way. Defining specific, meaningful notions
of "relevantly similar in this or that way" is hard.

Cheers,

I'm still not clear on what you are trying to do, but perhaps this helps:

... in the FRBR document "is expression of" is a predicate that  
relates an expression to a Work. Between each of the four Group 1  
entities there appears to be a single relationship:
   - is expression of (has expression)  E <-> Work
   - is manifestation of (has manifestation) M <-> E
   - is item of (has item) I <-> M

As for translations, Work is an abstract, until it is expressed, so  
only the Expression can be translated, not the Work. (That's the FRBR  
logic, I'm not necessarily defending it.)

I do think it is problematic that relationships have been specified as  
relating only between certain FRBR entities. In some cases I can see  
the logic (as in above on translations), in other cases I cannot.  
There's a lot about the implementation of FRBR that I think is far  
from settled.

Actually, it's worse than that. A predicate is a relationship between  
properties, yet the FRBR predicates have been made specific to a  
particular entity. It's not clear to me whether the predicate as  
defined is subject + predicate or predicate + object.

Note that in the publishing of RDA (which uses a lot of FRBR elements)  
we have tried to create a "general" level where properties and  
predicates are free of the FRBR entities -- in particular the Group 1  
entities -- so that communities with different interpretations of FRBR  
can continue to operate.

I think Ben is suggesting taking some inspiration from FRBR,
but ditching its Expression class and defining more predicates.

One way of doing this that is nice and reuseful is to use the
existing FRBR classes with different relationship logic and
reuse FRBR predicates where possible. The predicates embed
FRBR relationship logic in their constraints so they would have
to be changed to support our logic (FRBR absent Expression).

I think it is best to define classes in a new vocabulary rather
than try to shoehorn a different conceptual model into FRBR --
see [0] which is very provisional and will try to follow the
consensus on the wiki page.

I agree that if we do not want to use FRBR it would be better to  
create another model rather than try to create FRBR/prime. I would  
rather see a unified bibliographic record (not divided into WEMI) and  
a set of agents. I'm not sure what to do about subjects because I  
assume that ANYTHING can be a subject, so subject-ness is a  
relationship, not an entity. That would leave it open for you to pull  
in any property in the linked data space as a subject.

FRBR basically solidifies the traditional library catalog card view,  
which may be why so many of us are having a hard time with it.

Why not?  Could you have multiple representations of the same
'manifestation' (PDF, jpeg, PS, HTML, etc.).

I mean, those are still completely analogous to 'item', aren't they?

They're separate manifestations for publishers and (usually)  
libraries. ISBN rules require a different ISBN for each carrier (back  
to content v. carrier), although not all publishers follow that, and  
it may not make sense where carriers are output on the fly.

The basic rule is that manifestation includes the physical format;  
item is a single instance.

All of FRBR applies to anything one may catalog -- which generally  
means recorded knowledge/creation, but can also include museum  
objects. So, yes, articles are included.

The museum folks have incorporated FRBR into a larger model called CIDOC CRM -
and that's what has given us FRBRoo, a large unwieldy beast that makes  
library data look streamlined. [1]

The guidelines followed by the Library of Congress, and therefore, by most other Anglo-American libraries are in "LC Rule Interpretation 1.0 Decisions Before Cataloging", which can be found at the Cooperative Cataloging Rules Wiki at:
http://sites.google.com/site/opencatalogingrules/aacr2-chapter-1/1-0--decisions-before-cataloging---rev

Even before you begin to do anything, you must ask whether the specific item you are working with is a copy of something already in the catalog, or something new. That rather simple task is actually very complex.

They ask two apparently simple questions:
Before creating a bibliographic record, determine what is being cataloged. Answer these two questions:
1) What aspect of the bibliographic resource will the bibliographic record represent?
2) What is the type of issuance of that aspect?

Figuring out the answers takes you down some interesting paths. At the end of the Rule Interpretation, you will see some interesting guidelines that say what differences are allowed between one "manifestation" and another, e.g. different ISBNs do *not* have different manifestations.

I think it is important to realize that there is a great deal of variation between different agencies (publishers, libraries, other organizations) concerning what determines a manifestation and many libraries have their own interpretations as well. (For example, is a photocopy a new item or a new manifestation? Different libraries do different things) In any case, each field and each institution has different needs and I do not see agreement on any of this whether FRBR and/or RDA is accepted or not.

Subject: [open-bibliography] ANN: Fresnel Support in ORDF
Message-ID: <4C39D5C4.8050403@okfn.org>

Just a quick note that in addition to the jQuery/JavaScript
implementation of fresnel [0] there is now a functional,
if not quite complete, implementation in Python for
server-side applications [1] [2]. See for example the vocabulary
at [3] which is rendered using it.

A couple of vocabulary suggestions for the fresnel list,

  * a predicate (we're using ordf:lens) that can exist in a
    rdfg:Graph that gives a sensible default for which fresnel
    document to use to render it. For example the vocabulary
    in [3] has,

        ordf: ordf:lens <http://ordf.org/lens/ontology>

  * the Python implementation supports the use of
    ReStructuredText in text literals. Right now it just does
    this everywhere when a literal doesn't have a datatype.
    It would be perhaps better to have a predicate to use
    for a fresnel:Format, e.g.

        foo a fresnel:Format ;
            fresnel:valueStyle fresnel:rst .

I realize I forgot to mention "Differences Between, Changes Within: Guidelines on When to Create a New Record" from ALA (http://www.acrl.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alcts/resources/org/cat/differences.cfm), which also differs from the LC practice.

As a result from this multiplicity of guidelines which allow (or do not allow) for all kinds of variant, it is difficult to know precisely what information a specific resource has: what is the ISBN on the item, the number of pages, the precise dates on the item, and so on.

Forwarding to LLD WG, this mentions two use cases that may
or may not be out of scope for the group since they might stray
too far from traditional library science domains.

Use case 1: how to express curated lists of works, as in bibliographies
and reading lists.

Use case 2: how to express the state of scholarly knowledge or
debate about works and the relationships between them.

I've been meaning to write up the way I see aggregations/lists
being done since it was mentioned on the list last week. Briefly
making a curated list is just making an ore:Aggregation that
includes another ore:Aggregation per work/book/whatever.
The reason for two levels is that the lower level contains the
Work and its Authors since you normally want that information
together whereas the top level is a collection effectively of Works.

Richer predicates, such as the argumentative ones from CiTO
have been contemplated since the beginning but I think this
might be orthogonal to curated lists?

Not sure what happens when there is scholarly disagreement
about whether one work confirms another... Do we need to
go down the reification road here? e.g.:

    scholar1 a foaf:Person ;
        believes [ a Belief ;
                         rdf:subject book1 ;
                         rdf:predicate cito:confirms ;
                         rdf:object book2 ] .

    scholar2 a foaf:Person ;
        believes [ a Belief ;
                        rdf:subject book1 ;
                        rdf:predicate cito:refutes ;
                        rdf:object book2 ] .

This might expose a missing predicate in cito -- scholar2
might deny that book1 confirms book2 but not go so far as
to say it refutes it. I guess we need to get into beliefs about
beliefs in that case...

Cataloging is just one use of bibliographic data.  Citations are
another important use.  While different formats (e.g. Postscript &
PDF) should nominally be identical, there's no guarantee, so I'd argue
that each different format should be indexed as a separate
manifestation (or equivalent in the schema of your choice).

But this becomes a problem for comprehensibility and means a lot of work. My example was always this page of Thomas a Kempis' Imitation of Christ: 
http://www.ccel.org/ccel/kempis/imitation.html. Is this one "thing" or several? (This site has actually gotten rid of several formats over the years, e.g. http://web.archive.org/web/20030924082152/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/kempis/imitation.html)

Also, with materials in sites such as the Internet Archive, how do we deal with them:
http://www.archive.org/details/imitationofchris00newy

Is this 8 manifestations? That's a lot of extra records and work. Is it best for the readers and is it worthwhile to deal with them this way? And what happens when the Archive decides to automatically create, let's say XML versions for every document. Are these all going to be different manifestations? 

For these sorts of reasons, I personally have major theoretical problems with the concept of "manifestation" especially with practical effects when applied generally. I see the "manifestation" primarily as a throwback to the catalog/unit card, and I think there are far better ways of handling them with modern tools. 

But I realize we are probably stuck with what we have.

As a non-librarian, I have a related problem: I'm taking machine-OCRed
text from Internet Archive sets like these and hand-proofing them. These
are then going onto a site which contains text from a range of sources,
much of it scanned from originals by volunteers. We may end up with
variant copies of the same texts, and depending on the quality of the
original ocr and care taken in subsequent proofreading, the copies can
have varying fidelity to the originals. I would like to have some way to
identify these texts as coming from a particular original (the internet
archive is mostly extremely good at maintaining the camera metadata for
its scans, so there is a solid starting point), but also to identify the
series of processes it has been through after that. It seems to me that
with the vary large number of copies of text versions of
out-of-copyright material there are now floating round the internet some
way of establishing this kind of chain - and the likelihood of fidelity
to the original of the particular copy - is going to get more important.
Were those rude jokes in your copy of Alice in Wonderland really put
there by Carroll? Did Mark Twain really have such strange spelling as
your copy of a Yankee at the Court of King Arthur suggests? etc. This
doesn't seem to be the kind of thing librarians in general are
interested in, but maybe there are relevant techniques from archivists
dealing with mediaeval hand-copied texts?  Although these are definitely
different 'manifestations' of a text in a loose sense, they don't seem
to fit in FRBR either.

Are there any existing ways to handle this kind of thing? None of my
ideas for creating hashes of data + organization name as unique version
identifiers seem to hold up :-( I really don't believe attempting to
catalogue all the variants is either possible or desireable, surely each
version needs to be self-describing, not listed in a single place.

Sounds like the OPMV vocabulary might be useful, it deals
with Artifacts and Processes operating on Artifacts (controlled
by Agents).

http://open-biomed.sourceforge.net/opmv/ns.html

There is support in ORDF for this, see for example,
http://ordf.org/schema/ordf where the opmv:wasGeneratedBy
is filled in by the python process that imports a text file
into the database -- and in this case doesn't perform any
transformations but could well do.

Graham,

It looks like a wonderful project you are working on and should help a lot of people. And it's very interesting that we are seeing a return to the old scribal traditions of the pre-printing days, a tradition that has been forgotten, where today we take for granted that with additional editions (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc. editions) we end up with successive *improvements* of the text, we should remember that this idea of "improvement" has only been with us since the introduction of printing. Before printing, it was entirely turned around: the idea that the farther away from the original text we were, the more *corrupt* the text becomes, because of all the errors in hand copying. Therefore, in a world with all manuscripts the task was to recreate the original version.  Amazing how that is being transferred to the situation of today!

My own opinion is that OPMV is a step in the right direction, and there are places to describe where, when and how changes took place and who did them, I see no provision there for detailing *what those changes were*, which is what people really want. To get an idea of a traditional manuscript collation, there is a good discussion at: http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Collations.html with good examples, http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/Collations.html#Samples. This same basic method is used for early printed books as well although they also consider how the book was put together.

The traditional library determinations of an edition/manifestation that I pointed out before are based much more on changes in the physical item than in the changes in the text, i.e. if the transcription of the title page, formal edition statement, dates (within certain limitations), physical paging, and series statement is all the same, it is *assumed* to be the same edition/manifestation and is therefore handled as an item. But of course, the text inside could be slightly different or even completely different because librarians do not have the time to check compare texts so thoroughly. The opposite is the same as well: if something on the title page, dates, etc. is *different* it is considered a new edition even though the text may be completely the same. (This has resulted several scams by unscrupulous publishers, by the way; plus it happens more honestly with US vs. UK publications) In librarian terminology, this is called "content vs. carrier". Library tradition, under pressure of productivity, has almost always concentrated much more on carrier.

Naturally, the traditional collation methods of manuscripts cannot be used on web materials and I think the librarian emphasis on carrier also does not serve well in a digital environment. Still, the final product of a manuscript collation can be are pretty nice, since it details the changes very clearly. Modern tools can recreate these things automatically, e.g. in the Wikipedia History pages http://tinyurl.com/33khhjj where you can select any versions you want and the changes are displayed very clearly. 

In your case, could you do something similar to the Wikipedia history page by doing file compares or something?

Well, dear Jim, we see there 5 "things". They have something in common (or at least CCEL believes
so, putting them on the same page :-) How would you call that commonality ?

They are different incarnations of that commonality. Especially the mp3 incarnation looks pretty
different than the other 4 for me. How would you call these incarnations ?

How would you call them ? You have to record some differences, for the sake of the user or in order
to understand the different ways to mark "places" within the text (e.g. pages in pdf vs. locations
in Kindle format).

Besides, the "plain text" incarnation contains the string "^ccottifna to tl)e oriflinal intention of
ti)c ^utbor." which I do not see in the other incarnations :-)

If you are more catholic than the Pope, you produce 8 records. Otherwise, you exercise judgement and
you produce less :-)

Name them for this case, please.

I believe that the problem lies with the very concept of the "manifestation" which I have tried to show here and in other places, that it has always been merely a matter of *definition* and not a matter of any fact. There has always been this dichotomy in cataloging anyway, e.g. to use FRBR terminology:

Work/Expression (are abstractions. I cannot point to the *work* "Crime and Punishment* or any "Expression")
vs.
Manifestation/Item (are physical things. I can point to an Item containing "Crime and Punishment" and these items are combined into the "Manifestation")

Library practice *assumes* that specific changes in the physical item means a change in the abstraction (which has always been known to be incorrect, but otherwise, the task was impossible). What are these specific changes? What I mentioned before: changes in title page transcription, dates, and so on. Different organizations have different definitions for this, and even in AACR2/LCRI cataloging, there was a major change in recording paging practices (we stopped counting plates in many cases) so therefore, one day a book with plates was considered a different manifestation, but after this new directive, they suddenly become copies. (I remember how horrified I was!  :-)  ) As I have tried to show with the LCRI 1.0 and the ALA guidelines (plus many others out there) determining if something is a new edition or copy (or in FRBR terms manifestation or item) is both difficult to learn and to do, plus it is semi-capricious.

So, this led me to consider if there really is such a thing as a "manifestation" and if not, what is it? I have decided that the manifestation is a continuation of the hand-made catalog/unit card, which was used to summarize a collection's holdings. In reality, the "manifestation" is nothing more than a *group display of the items*. There is no single way of defining the group, and there are additional problems with manually determining manifestations, and can be very difficult to teach.

[Since I am the historian, I want to point out that in the past, there was a lot of interest to keep the number of cards to a minimum, for various reasons, and  often, there were notes leading the searcher to the "main entry card" where other editions etc. could be found. I tried to find a good example in Princeton's scanned catalog, but could only find this: http://tinyurl.com/25ms8u3 where it says, For more information see main card.]

My question is: if the manifestation is only a matter of definitions (IF title, publication information, dates etc. are all the same, then it is a duplicate; or if the date is within x number of years, it is a copy, and so on and so on) it seems as if this would be a perfect candidate for automatic sorting and display. If people (or computers) create the metadata record, they would always copy *exactly what they see* and instead of puzzling out which "manifestation" this item belongs to manually, let the machine sort out the displays.

What would this mean in reality: most information currently in the manifestation would go to the item, and then when processing the item (using xml, rdf, RDBMS or whatever) any information that is the same as in another item would be replaced with a URI to that information. As far as displays of the "group of items" goes, that could be left to the discretion of each database manager.

I think instituting something like this would make it far easier both for creating records and training, while everything would be much more accurate than what we have now.

But again, I don't think anything will change on this.

For sure, in libraryland the audio book is a new expression -- the  
same text but expressed differently. (Publishers consider it a  
performance. For Music, different performances are different  
expressions, so by analogy...) When the change is a change in  
presentation format, but still eye-readable text, it's considered a  
new manifestation. Uncorrected OCR... well, libraries don't have a  
category for that, since they don't work with that. It probably needs  
to be a special case of expression, like translation.

I wonder if the ISTC (international standard text code) will help us  
out with any of these. I don't know if ISTC's would be assigned to  
audio books or to OCR'd text, but they definitely would be assigned to  
the various ebook formats. That would give you an identifier in common  
between them even though the digital format has changed.

Last week Ben O'Steen and I set up a wordpress install running at:

<http://www.openbiblio.net/>

We plan to centralise all blog/cms type info for the various open
biblio projects we (the OKF) are involved in on that domain (i.e.
Public Domain Works, Bibliographica, JISC OpenBib). (We've already
migrated the content from: <http://blog.bibliographica.org/>  -- which
itself contains all info from old http://blog.publicdomainworks.net/).

We also want the site to be available for general usage for posting up
open biblio(graphic) project information or news items, should people
wish to use it! (Members of the working group would be especially
welcome to do so).

Thus, if there is anyone who would like to have access to post up
material please ping Ben (in cc).

Regards,

Rufus and Ben

Hm, hm ... I'm sure you spot easily in 93.2% of the cases which are the features of an item which
are not specific to that item (within the series we use to call edition) :-)

I still believe that the "common factor" (of the items) conventionally called "manifestation" is
useful, from a practical point of view.

For instance, suppose we produce the metadata using the RDF formalism. Let's say we have 4 nice
literals:

L1: THE IMITATION OF CHRIST

L2: BY Thomas A Kempis

L3: THE BRUCE PUBLISHING COMPANY

L4: November 5, 1940


and suppose you have in the catalogue 3 items a, b, c you decide to associate with these 4 literals.


a isbd:titleProper L1
a isbd:statementOfResponsibility L2
a isbd:publisher L3
a isbd:date L4

...

c isbd:date L4

... in totto 12 rdf:statements.

Now, suppose you notice the common factor of the 3 items and you "invent" an abstraction m, let's
call it "manifestation" (only for the sake of the discussion :-) and you produce the rdf:statemens:


m isbd:titleProper L1
m isbd:statementOfResponsibility L2
m isbd:publisher L3
m isbd:date L4

a frbr:exemplifies m
b frbr:exemplifies m
c frbr:exemplifies m

... in totto 7 rdf:statements.

In the first case you have n (items) x k (literals) statements and in the second case you have n + k
statements.

In a catalogue where n use to be 1 or 2, your solution is OK. But in a shared catalogue where n >> 2
?

Maybe for the edge cases. But for the usual ones, I don't think is that hard. Even my numismats
learn how to distinguish between the properties of an issue vs. the properties of an exemplar (coin)
:-)

  Comrades,

  Is there more information about this? In particular, what
  bibliographic data will be made available and when? If the sets are
  substantial, I would like to intergrate them in AuthorClaim as soon
