Hello,

it's the first Tuesday of this month and thus it's time for the
openbiblio group's virtual meeting. I started an Etherpad[1] with more
details. Feel free to add more points to the agenda, it's not much
yet.

Ciao

This is to let you know that there are two new sample data files
available from our website

http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datasamples.html

 

The first file is an updated version of the BNB in RDF/XML. The
substantive change is that the conversion now carries over the MARC
country code for the place of publication.

 

The second file is based on the same conversion but includes links to
linked data sources: LCSH in SKOS, MARC country and language codes,
Dewey info, Lexvo, GeoNames and the RDF Book Mashup.

 

Feedback welcome.

 

Cheers

  As discussed as as action item for me, I have sent an enquiry
  to Michael Ley of DBLP using http://www.isitopendata.org/.
  I would be happy for others to follow my example and approach
  other providers of the datasets listed at http://3lib.org.

My apologies for absence. I was in London visting funders (not on my
behalf). There is certainly interest in Open Bibliography.

Note also that BMC is keen to publish Open Bibliography.

Message-ID: <AANLkTimrD9WU-K4ZD71mrvdLkPG5u=1Z_o0+Z2Y9zjOF@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Isabel Holroyd of biab online asked me how the DOI system[1] should be
assessed in the light of the Principles on Open Bibliographic Data or
Open Knowledge in general.

In my opinion, this question isn't that easy to answer because on one
side DOIs aren't open in the sense that not anybody can provide DOIs
but on the other side they are open in the sense that anybody can use,
aggregate and disseminate already published DOIs. And it is this open
use and reuse of bibliographic data the openbiblio principles adress.
So, I believe, you can't deduce a recommendation to use or not use
DOIs from the principles. As I am not that familiar with the DOI
system, there might be other problems with it - e.g. with long-term
availibility of a free resolving mechanism or other.

What do you think?

All the best
Adrian

I think if we regard them as identiers and not resolvable addresses then we
have the simpler question of whether identifiers are copyright. ACS regard
their CAS identifiers as copyright - this is legal but not
community-friendly.

The best answer is probably to ask DOI/Crossref. If they say NO, then we
don't use them, if they say YES we use them if they say fudge we use them
with a take-down. I am fairly optimistic they will say yes.

Addressing your second point - the argument is that DOIs address the common problem of the sustainability of resolving mechanisms through collective responsibility based on mutual vested interest.

I should point out that only a small subset of the capability of the DOI (Handle) system is widely used - it also has the capacity to carry a richer metadata payload. So any statement about DOI specifically, coming from this initiative, should probably take care to be precise about which aspect of DOI (most probably the identifier, and possibly the resolver mechanism) it is addressing.

Must admit I've always been everso slightly confused by the
relationship between DOI's and the Global Handle Registry. The IDF
seems very keen to say that DOI's are more than just Handles, but
every time I read http://www.doi.org/factsheets/DOIHandle.html I'm
left with the feeling that the "much more" could be easily
(transparently?) replaced with something open and equally usable.

I'd be interested in knowing what could be provided using just Handles
and skipping the DOI middle-man. I'd certainly be careful not to throw
the handle baby out with the DOI bathwater.

all very vague on this tho, and would really love someone to fill in
my gaps with it.

Ian.

Sustainability of resolving mechanism is certainly a critical
requirement, but (And I absolutely think my knowledge is lacking here)
I'm not sold on the argument that "Sustainability is needed, DOI's do
sustainability, DOI's are needed". Maybe I just need to be pointed to
the reasoned out form of this argument.. is there such a beast?

Peter,
regarding your specific question on whether or not DOIs as identifiers are considered copyright. Like you, I expected that IDF would not make claims of copyright to DOI identifiers. I'm happy to say that I have just confirmed with Norman Paskin, Director of the International DOI Foundation, that IDF does not regard DOI names (identifiers) as copyright and, indeed, encourages their open and widespread use.

Hi Ian,

The very brief answer to this is that DOI is (mostly) Handle + governance/business framework (although this is over-simplifying a little). Handle gives the technical mechanism, the framework (involving the International DOI Foundation with its arrangements of Registration Agencies etc.) gives the sustainability. With continued growth and the introduction of new domains and Registration Agencies in the last year or two (research data through DataCite, movie/TV metadata through EIDR), the sustainability path seems to be working so far....

Organisations such as DataCite and EIDR have invested in DOI, because they accept the value proposition of the 'middleman'. Of course, in doing so, they also become part of the middleman, strengthening the value proposition.

I realise I have somewhat answered a question you didn't quite ask - but I think this aspect can't be ignored!

Cheers,

Paul

Regarding:

> "Sustainability is needed, DOI's do sustainability, DOI's are needed"

I think I would re-phrase this:

"Sustainability is needed. DOIs offer a promise of sustainability"

Up to you whether you 'buy into' the offer or not. The point is, I guess, that if you don't, you do need to find an alternative, if you care about sustainability.

I should point out that I sit on the IDF board as the JISC representative. My role is really in an advisory/knowledge-exchange capacity. Neither I, nor JISC, have any vested/business interest in DOI.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=krLZBUyEzO2FAp15BTKz=W=7Z1cT3yjqa70cy@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I just published the minutes for the yesterday meeting at
http://openbiblio.net/2011/02/02/minutes-8th-virtual-meeting-of-the-okfn-openbiblio-group/

There are two points I'd like to highlight here:

- There is an OKFN service "Is it open data?"
(http://isitopendata.org/) which can be used to ask providers of
(bibliographic) data sets whether their data is open. Members of the
working group and of this list are encouraged to make use of this tool
to get more information about the copyright status of bibliographic
data.
- We aim at getting more organisations to endorse the openbiblio
principles. So, if you know of such organisations please contact them
yourselves or let the list know about them. Karen will provide a call
for endorsement to use for organisations, indivudals, mailing lists
etc.

Cheers
Adrian

This seems like a good thing to me, but I don't think the IDF has much
to do with it.  Individual DOIs are minted by registrants, and it
seems to be quite plausible that some registrant may well mint DOIs
that it regards as copyright (just to be clear, I mean the DOI
itself).  There's nothing stopping a registrant from doing that, is
there?

  Especially those that are already on http://3lib.org. I have given
  it a start by writing to the DBLP head honcho Michael Ley. Here
  is what I wrote, 

| Dear Micheal,
| 
| I am using DBLP to as part of an interdisciplinary open-access author
| registration service at http://authorclaim.org. I provide a link back
| to DBLP for every record used. See ftp://ftp.authorclaim.org.
| 
| As a side concern, am also working on the open knowledge foundations
| bibliographic working group. As part of this, I am writing to seek
| clarification of the 'openness' [1] of the DBLP data.
| 
| I wasn't able to find an explicit statement that the data was open
| such as a reference to an open knowledge or data license [2] so I'm
| writing to find out what the exact situation is. In particular we
| would like to know whether the material can be made available under an
| open license of some kind.
| 
| Thank you very much for your time and I look forward to receiving your
| response.

  In other news, I have now integrated the IUCR in AuthorClaim,
  http://authorclaim.org. Kindly check the description I made
  of the set at http://authorclaim.org/collections/iucr.

  At http://authorclaim.org/about#reuse I have clarified reuse
  of AuthorClaim data.

There is nothing from anyone claiming that the air is copyright and that
breathing it infringes.  As far as I am concerned let's take what we have
and not suggest ways in which it can be challenged.

I think the IDF position I have given is the default position for RAs as well as the IDF itself and, so far, no-one has departed from that default. The IDF is, essentially, the RAs working towards common cause, so I think it is relevant.

However, I'm very inclined to agree with Peter's approach here....

Yes, it is to reflect the different granularity. The data in the 260$a
is at the city, town level whereas the data recorded in the 008/15-17 in
the MARC record is at the country level. We thought it may be helpful to
keep that distinction but if the consensus is that it is not, then we
can use the same element.

The first file is an updated version of the BNB in RDF/XML. The

country code for the place of publication.

 

The second file is based on the same conversion but includes links to
linked data sources: LCSH in SKOS, MARC country and language codes,
Dewey info, Lexvo, GeoNames and the RDF Book Mashup.

Thanks

I guess that ideally I'd see the more specific place of publication
identified by a geonames http uri, then the rest of the hierarchy of
geography can be dealt with by the more specialised resources available.

What I don't like about the approach you describe is it establishes a
convention outside the formal definitions in isbd and rda (as far as I can
see?) - if both the 'country level' and more specific (where available) are
to be represented within the BL data, then I think properties that match
these definitions would be needed for it to be useful - otherwise you may as
well use the same property for both.

That said, I'd go back to my original preference  - I'm not sure the benefit
you get from expressing 'London' and 'England' separately when you could
just use http://sws.geonames.org/2643743/about.rdf

Hello,

the first translation of the openbiblio principles (to German) is now
published, see http://openbiblio.net/principles/de/.

It would be great to create and publish more translations to further
promote the openbiblio principles internationally. Anyone?

Cheers
Adrian

How about doing something like this:

:book rda:placeOfPublication [ skos:prefLabel "London, England" ].

which can then be augmented to

:book rda:placeOfPublication [ 
    dcterms:spatial <http://sws.geonames.org/2643643>;
    skos:prefLabel "London, England"
].

(the rda predicate chosen at random, doesn't bother me which one
is used and settled on).

This would lessen the burden on the BL to do the geocoding (if that
is a concern). The key point is the indirection which makes it 
possible to augment the description after the fact with richer
information so having a second entry,

:book rda:placeOfPublication [ skos:prefLabel "England" ].

is perfectly fine.

Also I notice that trying to actually retrieve that geonames URL
currently yields "Error: the free servers are currently overloaded
with requests."

Owen, one hitch here is that place of publication is not a geographic  
data element. I know that sounds odd, but in fact "place of  
publication" and "publisher" in fact are:

"the place of publication as listed on the title page"
"the publisher as listed on the title page"

They are what library cataloging calls "transcribed" elements, and are  
intended to be surrogates for the actual title page (along with title  
proper and statement of responsibility). So if either is wrong or  
fictitious, it is still transcribed. (There are more caveats here:  
some cataloging rules allow you to abbreviate or expand, etc. etc.)

In fact, there is no data element in library cataloging for either the  
place of publication or the publisher as an entity. MARC adds a coded  
country of publication, as noted below, and that *is* a geographic  
entity.

Thanks Karen.

At the moment the RDA property does not reflect this nuance - is this a
change in RDA, or is there a separate property in RDA that represents the
transcribed value?
The isbd:P1016 element is less clear to me - the definition says:
"Relates a resource to the name of the place associated on the prescribed
source of information with the name of the publisher, producer or
distributor."
and an additional note
"Usually given on the preferred source of information as the name of a city.
If no publisher, producer or distributor is named, it is the place from
which the resource was issued or distributed."

This sounds like it might mean that this represents the transcribed value
but I'm not sure - can you clarify?

Anyhow, it seems to me that where the transcribed value is actually an
identifiable place, we should not ignore that just because the data was a
transcription from the title page? That is - if we can offer a geoname URI,
why would we not? However, what it may suggest is that an additional
property is needed to represent the transcribed value vs the actual place

What do you think?

No, unfortunately the cataloging rules themselves (and the elements  
that they spawn) are not overt about this distinction; you have to  
read through many paragraphs of text to discern which elements and  
areas are transcribed, and sometimes it isn't a binary condition --  
"transcribe unless..." . It's been an underlying philosophy in  
cataloging that until recently has gone unchallenged. Some of us are  
trying to bring it more to the foreground so that we can clear up the  
"data-ness" of the library catalog data.

It's like reading someone else's code, isn't it? :-) "Prescribed  
source of information" is where you take the data from, and you have  
to dig around in the rules to learn where that is. "usually given  
on..." implies transcription. So I'm reading that as being  
transcribed. Another clue is to know whether the cataloging rules in  
question follow ISBD, which says: (0.5) "Elements in areas 1, 2, 4 and  
6 are normally transcribed from the resource..."

Yes, exactly. As long as the library cataloging rules require  
transcription we will have to have some data elements represented in  
two ways: as transcribed, and as data. Right now, RDA is not good at  
distinguishing between these and my gut feeling is that we will need  
to add some additional data elements to cover this distinction.

Hi Corine,

[ I'm ccing the library linked data list: this begins to smell like real *linked* data that has tricky LD issues ;-)  ]

It's really great if BNB explicitly includes links to LD sources like LCSH!  It deserves feedback indeed...

The way you make the connection puzzles me a bit, though. Taking the following example:

   <rdf:Description>
     <dcterms:title>London fragments : a literary expedition</dcterms:title>
     <dcterms:alternative>Londoner Fragmente. English</dcterms:alternative>
[...]
     <dcterms:subject>
       <rdf:Description>
         <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/authorities#conceptScheme" />
         <skos:prefLabel>Go?rner, Ru?diger--Travel--England--London.</skos:prefLabel>
         <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept" />
       </rdf:Description>
     </dcterms:subject>
     <dcterms:subject>
       <rdf:Description rdf:about="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh2008107012#concept">
         <skos:inScheme rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/authorities#conceptScheme" />
         <skos:prefLabel>Literary landmarks--England--London.</skos:prefLabel>
         <rdf:type rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept" />
       </rdf:Description>
     </dcterms:subject>


I have tried in the past to exploit the record data and make connection between with existing concepts from other sources, and of course there are many problems (because of pre-coordination, or just because of typos or label changes in the considered KOS).
So I understand why you define "on-the-fly" (and "in-the-data") the concepts that you can't find in the LCSH linked data. And I think this is a reasonable solution.

What puzzles me is the second subject, for which you could recognize an existing concept from id.loc.gov. Here you duplicate the data, by copying some info you have. I'd have expected
<dcterms:subject rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh2008107012#concept">
alone.

Here you are in effect duplicating data that is served on id.loc.gov. Is it to give some minimum data that you want to provide applications with, so that they would not have to go and fetch data from id.loc.gov, a sort of "data cache"?

Also, is it generated only from the original book record at BL only? If yes, there are two risks:

- that your data is less complete than the one of other services [1], but still it lets your data consumer think that this it is complete. In which case, these consumers could decide to have their services not follow their nose to the more complete data, which could be harmful to everyone.

- that your data conflicts with the reference one. This is in fact the case, as your prefLabel ends with a period ("Literary landmarks--England--London.") while the ones at id.loc.gov do not [2]. Ok, here I am quite nitpicking, but there could be cases where the mismatch is bigger.

Best,

Antoine

[1] e.g., if you don't have skos:broader that id.loc.gov has for LCSH concepts, or the xml:lang tag with "en" for your skos:prefLabel
[2] http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh2008107012.rdf

It would be nice if the constructed heading could have references to the component LCSH concepts. 

It seems unfortunate that skos:OrderedCollection and skos:Concept are disjoint. If they weren't, then the component concepts could be listed in a skos:memberList. Barring that, I could imagine a new SKOS property like this to expression the coordination:

skos:coordinates a owl:ObjectProperty ;
	rdfs:domain skos:Concept ;
	rdfs:range skos:OrderedCollection .

There is an issue with the way the RDF is specified IMHO and you have to 
read the SKOS specification to understand the implications of the above
RDF:

  <http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#L1567>

S13 skos:prefLabel, skos:altLabel and skos:hiddenLabel are pairwise disjoint properties. 
S14 A resource has no more than one value of skos:prefLabel per language tag.

If LC declares:

@BASE <http://id.loc.gov/authorities/>
<sh2008107012#concept> skos:prefLabel "Literary landmarks--England--London."

and the above RDF declares the same, then the integrity constraint S13 and S14 are
violated because there now exists two triples in the combined graph of resources
that say the same thing, thus S13 is violated because of the pairwise disjoint 
constraint and S14 is violated because there is more than one skos:prefLabel per 
language.

If you want to do something like this then IMHO use rdfs:label instead of 
skos:prefLabel to get around integrity constraints S13 and S14.

 
Andy.

A quite note, related to my comment on the data served by BL being potentially different from the one at id.loc.gov. The data above has:
<skos:prefLabel>Literary landmarks--England--London.</skos:prefLabel>
And id.loc.gov has
<skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Literary landmarks--England--London</skos:prefLabel>
Because of BL not committing to a specific literal language tag, S14 is in fact not violated: interesting side effect ;-)
But I agree, the best would be that BL publishes exactly the same prefLabel as id.loc.gov. That would ensure that there's never any issue!

As I said, I think that the "option" to serve concept data like this is reasonable only when these concepts are not already present on id.loc.gov. Otherwise it could raise quite many problems...

Best,

Antoine

Hi Jeff,

As this coordination issue is complex indeed, this was not handled in SKOS. Instead it relies on specific extensions to be designed--this is MADS/RDF [1] is made for, in fact!

Just check I'm reading this correctly

The problem arises because the BL is essentially trying to say which of the
SKOS preflabels the BL prefers? Presumably  "for display purposes you should
use this label" (or something like that)?

Corine - are you able to clarify?

Hi Antoine and all,

Many thanks for the feedback and apologies for the length of this email.

In answer to the questions about 
<dcterms:subject>
>>         <rdf:Description
>> rdf:about="http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh2008107012#concept">
>>           <skos:inScheme
>> rdf:resource="http://id.loc.gov/authorities#conceptScheme" />
>>           <skos:prefLabel>Literary landmarks--England--
>> London.</skos:prefLabel>
>>           <rdf:type
>> rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept" />
>>         </rdf:Description>
>>       </dcterms:subject>

And

1. why does the literal value contained in <skos:prefLabel> Literary landmarks--England--
London.</skos:prefLabel> does not exactly match the one served by LC at id.loc.gov for http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh2008107012#concept?

The answer is that it should. We've matched the LCSH heading contained in the bibliographic record to the LCSH heading in the authority file. The issue is to do with punctuation (which is input at the end of the heading in the bib record but is not part of the heading in the authority file). We'll address this in the conversion - this is an issue in the LCSH headings and I believe in other parts of our output. [So no, we "are *not* essentially trying to say which of the SKOS preflabels the BL prefers" as one post tried to double-guess]

2. Why does our output does not include the xml:lang="en" in <skos:prefLabel>
This is because in some cases this xml:lang="en" whilst true to the data served up by id.loc.gov is actually not correct. For example, if you look at  
<http://id.loc.gov/authorities/sh94003128#concept> for Parque Nacional Torotoro (Bolivia), we have
<skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Parque Nacional Torotoro (Bolivia)</skos:prefLabel>

instead of Spanish. 

I assume the reason for that is that there isn't the granularity in MARC 21 - where these headings originates from - to code the language of each data element. So when LC expresses LCSH in SKOS, they couldn't specify and went for the language of the majority of the headings, which is English.

So we - ok, I ;-) thought we could do "without" the xml:lang attribute since it wasn't "correct" in all cases. I didn't realise the implications.

3. Why are we outputting both the literal value and the resource URI? 
In a very first attempt, we'd only included the resource URI as you suggest. They were concerns about the two being out of sync., e.g. when a LCSH is updated. In fact, this is one of the uses of those URIs - enabling easier updating of bibliographic data. 

But we got some advice to the contrary. Some linked data platforms index the literal values to improve searching; it was also pointed out that there may be a risk of the linked dataset we link to "disappearing".

There are other considerations: we are putting our data out for people to use and re-use; and we are not too sure what they want to do with it yet - so as you suggest, some of them may not want or be able to go and fetch data from id.loc.gov. or any other data sets we link to. A related question is to do with the time and resources to produce these files. At the moment, we are concentrating on the BNB but the intention is to work on other data sets. We are currently working on two versions of the file, a "non-URI" and a "with added-URI" version of the data and ideally, it would be good to have only one version - the "with added-URI" one - to maintain/produce if it meets the needs of all/most people.

Now it's my turn for a question ;-)

In your feedback, you highlight the risk of "that your data is less complete than the one of other services"[1] e.g., if you don't have skos:broader that id.loc.gov has for LCSH concepts.

So to take the example of LCSH at id.loc.gov, how much of the data included there should I replicate in my instance data? Isn't the <skos:prefLabel> and the resource URI sufficient? If you need other info, like <skos:altLabel> or <skos:broader>, won't you be able to fetch it via the resource URI?

That's it for now ;-)

I would also like to say that from later today I shall be offline for the next two weeks. So that people don't think we don't want to engage or anything like that if there is no post. I really appreciate feedback.

Cheers

Corine

A quite note, related to my comment on the data served by BL being potentially different from the one at id.loc.gov. The data above has:
<skos:prefLabel>Literary landmarks--England--London.</skos:prefLabel>
And id.loc.gov has
<skos:prefLabel xml:lang="en">Literary landmarks--England--London</skos:prefLabel>
Because of BL not committing to a specific literal language tag, S14 is in fact not violated: interesting side effect ;-)
But I agree, the best would be that BL publishes exactly the same prefLabel as id.loc.gov. That would ensure that there's never any issue!

As I said, I think that the "option" to serve concept data like this is reasonable only when these concepts are not already present on id.loc.gov. Otherwise it could raise quite many problems...

Best,

Antoine

Antoine, Jeff,

Yes, we're hoping to use LCSH in MADS/RDF when LC publishes it.

Alternatively we were wondering whether FAST (Faceted Application of Subject Terminology)[1] might help. There was a project update [2] presented at ALA and it was announced that FAST will be made available as linked data in the spring of 2011.

Cheers

Hello Corine,

Re. 1 and 2, in fact your decision not to put the language tags is what saves you from the inconsistency Andrew has warned about. If you were using the same language tag as id.loc.gov, but a different literal (and adding one dot to a literal makes it an entirely different literal), then your data would be inconsistent with the id.loc.gov one.

Now, on having a language tag or not, I see your issue, but personally I'm ok with originally Spanish labels being considered as English ones, if there's no English translation for them.
Anyway, the core issue to me here is that this language tag dilemma also applies for LoC, which made the opposite choice. Ideally if you publish data on LC concepts, it should be compatible with what LC has--"compatible" in the formal but also informal way: whether there is an inconsistency or not, a data consumer may still be extremely puzzled why LC and BL can't agree on their concepts' prefLabels!

Re. 3, getting data for indexing is a very valid concern. But it also could be done just before the indexing step, not in the data you publish. But well, you are perhaps in the best position to judge: as you have put it, this is about what you feel you should provide to your typical data consumers. Note, however, that putting the labels re-introduces the risk of being out-of-synch with a central repository, which you correctly identified in your first move.

About the danger of a target source being put offline, that is also a valid point. But for id.loc.gov I wouldn't be so worry. In fact, BL starting to rely on it for its data would be a key motivation for LC not to put it offline :-)


Re. your last question, I guess I can only repeat what I've written above. My gut feeling would be to replicate as little as possible: ideally, the URI should be the only thing present in your data! But if you have clear ideas about the amount of efforts your data consumers would be willing to undergo, you should adapt your data to make their life easier.
Note that the data consumers who'd be interested in such caching might be the ones interested in accessing large dumps of data at once. So the "true linked data version" (what you get when following your nose over HTTP) could include only the URIs, but a fit-for-purpose dump of your entire catalogue may include a bit more.

Best,

Antoine

Hi Antoine, 

Many thanks for that.  

Just to clarify (in case the folks at LC are wondering!), I was making a
general point about the permanence of linked data sets. I'm not worried
about id.loc.gov being put offline. [but you knew that really ;-)]

Best wishes

Corine

Thanks for the clarification Corine - apologies for my misreading of the
intention.

I'd just add my +1 to what Antoine said (all points I think)

Thanks you very much for a full reply. This is very helpful.

I am copying this in to the Open Bibliography list. For their background I
have been exploring with Eefke and the STM Publishers association whether
text-mining was allowable and whether bibliographic data is copyrightable.
Eefke gives a clear answer to the second so I am posting this on this list.
I think it now makes possible a lot of very valuable things with Open
Bibliographic Data.

We  have addressed this in "Principles of Open Bibliographic Data"

We have essentially covered these in
*Core data: names and identifiers of author(s) and editor(s), titles,
publisher information, publication date and place, identification of parent
work (e.g. a journal), page information, URIs.*

I think this is entirely in line with the you and your STM colleagues and
this agreement is an extremely important step forward.

Precisely what that is does indeed depend. Our list of secondary
bibliographic data overlaps greatly with yours. I have highlighted the
components that I would believe would be uncopyrightable.

*Secondary data*: *format of work*, *non-web identifiers (ISBN, LCCN, OCLC
number etc.)*, *an indication of rights associated with a work, information
on sponsorship (e.g. funding), information about carrier type, extent and
size information, administrative data (last modified etc.), relevant links
(to wikipedia, google books, amazon etc.), table of contents, links to
digitized parts of a work (tables of content, registers, bibliographies
etc.), addresses and other contact details about the author(s),* cover
images, abstracts, reviews, summaries, subject headings, assigned keywords,
classification notation, user-generated tags, exemplar data (number of
holdings, call number), ?

This does not mean that the others were by default copyrightable, but we
know of places where people have asserted rights over some of them.

I think you and I differ about whether tables and graphs are copyrightable
in this context. I would concede that images which contained createive work
were copyrightable but that images representing factual information (e.g.
chemical structures) were not copyrightable. For example it would be foolish
to be unable to communicate a chemical structure to someone because you
might break copyright. There are millions of such images on suppliers
bottles and witholding this infromation means that people could and would
die.

I also asked about whom I should contact within a publisher to get a
definitive answer from that organization (as most of the time I get no
reply).

This seems to confirm that it can therefore be quite difficult to get the
right person within a large publishing house and get an answer.

I'm not sure in these cases that your argument is very strong. If I 
scan the cover of a book and print and sell posters of it I am
likely to run afoul of a copyright claim. Reviews and possibly
summaries likely stand alone as works in themselves and I wouldn't
consider them to generally be bibliographic data at all (except
inasmuch as the text of a book itself is bibliographic data).

"One thing to be careful of with prefLabel is that SKOS does not explicitly express the constraint that  prefLabel's must be unique in a given scheme."

Small point, but I'm not certain this is implied either.  In other words, I don't think there is comment one way or another about two distinct resources (concepts) with identical prefLabels in the same scheme.  The "pairwise disjoint" rule applies to one concept (a resource) having no more than one prefLabel per language.  (Actually...because a skos:Concept can belong to zero or more skos:ConceptSchemes, one might argue that the designers accepted the notion that two distinct concepts that share an identical prefLabel might one day end up in the same scheme.  Implying, of course, that two distinct concepts with identical prefLabels in the same scheme was an acceptable possibility.  There's still nothing that explicitly or implicitly suggests they are owl:sameAs to each other.  But, I digress.)

As you know, in SKOS, when representing LC subject headings, which come from the MARC, we lose the distinctions between the components of a subject heading - the fact that one component is a Topic, another a Geographic Subdivision, something a Genre/Form, etc.  In MADS/RDF, the componentList components, which represent the individual headings that constitute the authoritativeLabel, will indicate the types of the individual headings found in the authoritativeLabel.  So, there might be two resources in the same scheme with identical authoritativeLabels, but the resources collected in the MADS/RDF componentList provide a means to further disambiguate between the two headings.  But, like SKOS, there is no attempt to say that these data points for any one resource must be unique in a given scheme. ( The fact that a particular heading is a subdivision is information that will be recorded differently.  MADS/RDF does not attempt to capture such information explicitly. )

Cordially,

Kevin

Hi Jeff,

As this coordination issue is complex indeed, this was not handled in SKOS. Instead it relies on specific extensions to be designed--this is MADS/RDF [1] is made for, in fact!

There are complexities in the syntax and semantics of subdivided, coordinated, compound, and faceted headings that aren't really addressed by the MADS/RDF proposal.

I have a presentation covering  some  aspects of the semantics of subdivided and faceted headings at ISKO-UK conference  in London this year.

One thing to be careful of with prefLabel is that SKOS does not explicitly express the constraint that  prefLabel's must be unique in a given scheme.  This restriction is tricky to express, even with OWL 2  Key Properties, as prefLabels are annotation properties, and are thus not covered by the OWL 2  semantics.  The constraint can be expressed for skosxl, as skosxl:prefLabel is an ObjectProperty, and literalForm is a DataProperty (though there's a little bit of trickiness needed to make sure that two Labels with the same literalForm aren't used as skosxl:prefLabel for different concepts).  Also, if the same label is used for two concepts, HasKey will infer that they are owl:sameAs.

coordinated, compound, and faceted headings that aren't really addressed by
the MADS/RDF proposal.

I have a presentation covering  some  aspects of the semantics of subdivided
and faceted headings at ISKO-UK conference  in London this year.

One thing to be careful of with prefLabel is that SKOS does not explicitly
express the constraint that  prefLabel's must be unique in a given scheme.
 This restriction is tricky to express, even with OWL 2  Key Properties, as
prefLabels are annotation properties, and are thus not covered by the OWL 2
 semantics.  The constraint can be expressed for skosxl, as skosxl:prefLabel
is an ObjectProperty, and literalForm is a DataProperty (though there's a
little bit of trickiness needed to make sure that two Labels with the same
literalForm aren't used as skosxl:prefLabel for different concepts).  Also,
if the same label is used for two concepts, HasKey will infer that they are
owl:sameAs.

Hi Simon,

I think we agree. There are probably areas of coordination that are not properly tackled by MADS/RDF (but I prefer to leave it to Kevin's mail for this discussion) and there are SKOS spec parts that can't be represented properly in OWL [1].
The question if it helps already to solve important problems. I believe it does--and as for SKOS, it is an RDF vocabulary, so you can still extend it to match your own more precise needs. I'm looking forward to see your presentation (online), btw.

Antoine

[1] At the time we did not have the resource for coming with a proper OWL2 ontology (OWL2 was not a standard then anyway) but we also thought it would fail capturing everything. If you're interested in the matter, there was since a blog post by Paul Hermans on that: http://www.proxml.be/users/paul/weblog/d1855/Where_OWL_fails_another_OWL_arises.html

Right, but the context of that rule is a thesaurus or controlled  
vocabulary in which the "prefLabel" *is* the identifier for the  
"thing." There were no URIs in 1876. FRAD continues this by  
essentially having two identifiers -- one for machines (URI) and one  
for humans (prefLabel). This makes sense, to some degree, because you  
do want to communicate unambiguously to both machines and humans, but  
I'm not totally convinced that prefLabel is the way to do that, since  
different communities are likely to favor different prefLabels. (Think  
of the difference between MeSH subject headings and LCSH subject  
headings for the same thing.) Communicating to humans unambiguously is  
devilishly hard, as we know.

[Some parts of the skos discussion  informally referenced the OWL 1.1 draft,
but I don't think HasKey was on the menu at the time].

SPIN is very nice; I think it does close the world, which is useful in these
cases.

The prefLabel uniqueness issue can be handled for skos-xl; the annotation
property labels are not rdf semantics friendly.

The Eurovoc ontology does some interesting sparql spackle on top of skos-xl
to infer the annotation property labels.

In regards to the requirement that preflabel must be unique within a scheme,
this is an essential property of controlled vocabularies (ambiguity
control).  See e.g. NISO Z39.19 section 5.3.1 (not sure what the paragraph
number is in 2788, but it's roughly the same wording).

It's been LC policy since 1876 :-) [Cutter rule # 173].

"A notation is a string of characters such as "T58.5" or "303.4833"  
used to uniquely identify a concept within the scope of a given  
concept scheme. "

I don't think this does it. This is just a code representing the  
concept. I don't see how it would allow you to have different  
preflabels for different communities.

  Antoine:

In a previous life I served on a MARBI task group considering the 
problem of language in authorized headings.  The problem here is that 
the AACR2 rules allowed for the creation of 'mixed' headings, e.g., 
heading strings that included portions (usually separately subfielded) 
in different languages.  The group was trying to figure out how these 
separate parts could be separately identified as to language, but 
eventually we gave up on the task--MARC just wasn't set up to do that, 
and in fact every accommodation for the varieties of language and script 
used to 'patch' MARC up in some specific circumstances create their own 
particular problems down the line.

So what we have here is yet another 'holy grail' (compatibility) which 
may not be achievable.  Any default attribution of language will be 
wrong in some unknown percentage of cases.  I really think that our only 
hope is to separately identify what has been cobbled together for use 
within card catalogs, and move towards a faceted approach, perhaps the 
one that FAST has taken.

As for the separate choices made by BL and LC, I'm not entirely sure 
that agreement is required or even optimal, particularly given the 
differences in spelling everyone insists on retaining!

Considering these variant preferred labels as "language forms" is not exactly the best way of looking at it. In AACR2, the form of, e.g. a name of a corporate body, is almost always based on the language of the body itself. Therefore, the heading for the Budapest Museum of Fine Arts is set up in Hungarian. We can see this at work very clearly in VIAF, which attempts to bring varying national forms together: http://viaf.org/viaf/130785279/ We also see that not everyone follows such a rule.

But when it comes to international bodies, variants really go crazy, since the AACR2 rule is to set it up in English when available. Naturally, this applies for each cultural group and each will set up names in its own languages. So, for the World Health Organization, we see this: http://viaf.org/viaf/135618969/ where there are all kinds of preferred forms.

It gets even crazier with other international corporate bodies, e.g. The Commonwealth of Independent States, http://viaf.org/viaf/131775197/ which is an international body with different official languages, none of which is English, but because of our rules, the form is set up in English anyway. Other cultures use different forms.

Concerning personal names, the rules become still more complex, but forms are remain based mainly on the form of the name of the author on the item(s) they publish. So, we have Tolstoi, Nikita Ilich http://viaf.org/viaf/9962566/ (Russian form), but for Tolstoy, Leo, graf, 1828-1910 http://viaf.org/viaf/96987389/ he is set up in an anglicized form because he is more famous, so other rules kick in. 

In any case, this should show that "language form" is a bit dubious when discussing the preferred forms. Also, it shows how vital are the cross-references for a U.S. art student trying to find exhibition catalogs from Budapest. Still, just these few examples demonstrate how the VIAF has already become such a wonderful and incredibly useful tool. I hope that it may point the way forward, somehow.

Jeff, these seem to be different schemes, not different prefLabels.  
They've been given equivalence, but have different identifiers. My  
point is that prefLabel choice is not just a question of language, but  
language is the only option we have to creating different prefLabels  
for the same identified concept.

Diane, Jim,

Point taken: I obviously oversimplified the problem! I was really focusing on the fact that BL would declare statements that contradicts the ones at LoC.

Again, I would find very strange that the BL would want to "overrule" a prefLabel (for a given language tag) from LCSH. It ruins the benefits that building and using *controlled* vocabularies bring, wouldn't it? Which is why using URIs in the subjects only really better.
But well, if for some reason BL really wanted to have an English spelling published in their data, it is possible to use another language tag (like, "en-uk"), or even no language tag, since id.loc.gov is using "en" as a default for now. But if one day LoC changes their mind (considering all your arguments on mixed headings and other subtleties, for instance) and remove their language tags, then there could be contradictions arising...

Best,

Antoine

The problem here is that the AACR2 rules allowed for the creation of 'mixed' headings, e.g., heading strings that included portions (usually separately subfielded) in different languages. The group was trying to figure out how these separate parts could be separately identified as to language, but eventually we gave up on the task--MARC just wasn't set up to do that, and in fact every accommodation for the varieties of language and script used to 'patch' MARC up in some specific circumstances create their own particular problems down the line.

The Open Bibliographic Data Working Group of the Open Knowledge  
Foundation has published a set of principles for open bibliographic  
data. [1] These principles express a philosophy of openness for  
bibliographic data in support of research and knowledge enhancement:

"For society to reap the full benefits from bibliographic endeavours,  
it is imperative that bibliographic data be made open - that is,  
available for anyone to use and re-use freely for any purpose."

It is hoped that these principles can become a rallying point for the  
ongoing discussion in the knowledge community about the ownership and  
use of this key data. You are invited to visit the OpenBiblio pages  
[2], read the principles [1], and add your name in support of  
bibliographic data that is unfettered by proprietary claims [3].

Personal endorsements are welcome, as are endorsements representing  
institutions or organizations. If you are representing a larger body,  
please note that in the comments area. Note also that the Working  
Group is interesting in hosting translations of the principles. If you  
can provide a translation, please contact openbiblio [at] okfn [dot]  
org.

Bibliography may not sound romantic but it's playing a central part in how
we manage scholarship and institutions in the C21.

Karen,

I disagree that "language is the only option we have to create different
prefLabels." My LCSH vs. MESH illustration shows how skos:ConceptScheme
can be used as another dimension. If I had asserted owl:sameAs between
the two concepts, then we would agree that the two skos:prefLabels end
up colliding. Instead of using owl:sameAs, though, I used
skos:exactMatch. This is a weaker form of "equivalence" that preserves
the separate identities of the LCSH and MESH concepts while recognizing
"a high degree of confidence that two concepts can be used
interchangeably across a wide range of information retrieval
applications".

http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/#L4858

I assume that MESH terms are jargon whereas LCSH terms are more suitable
for laymen. I think the definition of skos:exactMatch is a pretty good
match for this situation.

Jeff

I agree that you have stated these as equivalents, but do you agree  
that these two concepts use different identifiers?

The form doesn't really make it clear when we are getting an  
institutional endorsement, and we may want to think about how to make  
that clearer.

On the call, we talked about having a logo for those who have endorsed  
the principles. The question is: do we want to announce that with this  
mail, or later? I think it could go either way.

The constraint is stronger than that; If two Things have different preferred
labels  in a given language in the same conceptScheme, then it is
necessarily true that they have different identifiers, *and* that the
identifiers are owl:differentFrom.

 Notice that LCSH has different schemes for juvenile and non-juvenile
headings (some of which have the same preferred label/Descriptor).   Terms
can be in different
registers<http://www.ttt.org/clsframe/datcats02.html#register>without
being in different languages.  There's even an ISO registry of
register - http://www.isocat.org/rest/dc/1988 .

Also, if distinct uris which refer to Concepts which exactMatch, the
Concepts have the same extension, but the uris need not refer to the same
Concept object (in fact, in the case discussed above, the URIs cannot be
referring to the same object).

BTW, SKOS explicitly declines to make exactMatch reflexive,  though it does
make it Symmetric and Transitive, which means that if A exactly matches
anything, it exactly matches itself.

It's not that it's a problem, but it does mean that you and I are  
talking about different things.

It appears that if you wish to use a different prefLabel than one  
already established for a concept, and the difference is *not* that  
you will be using a different natural language, then you must define a  
new concept with a new identifier. SKOS, like FRAD, seems to have two  
intertwined identifiers: the URI and the preLabel. If you change the  
prefLabel, or prefer to use a different one, you need to create a new  
vocabulary entry with a new identifier. This seems to me to be a  
constraint on vocabularies that may not be ideal in practice.

I was hoping that URIs would predominate, and that prefLabels would be  
just that: preferred labels, not identifiers. That would mean that the  
prefLabel could change, or that different communities could PREFER  
different labels, because the label would not be a determinant of the  
identity of the concept. From this discussion I am concluding that is  
not the case. Thus SKOS is very much like the traditional string-based  
thesauri.

Simon,

 

I'm confused by your statement "the Concepts have the same extension". 

 

I think we agree that the MESH and LCSH Concepts are owl:differentFrom
despite their skos:exactMatch relationship. I assume this is the source
of Karen's confusion on the identity of "the thing" (concept) they
presumably have in common. 

 

I admit this proposal is disconcerting because it uses both skos:Concept
and frbr:Concept, but it would resolve the problem of different
prefLabels in different schemes for the same thing. For example:

 

mesh:concept1 a skos:Concept ;

                skos:inScheme mesh:scheme ;

                skos:exatcMatch lcsh:concept1 ;

                skos:prefLabel "The MESH term" ;

                foaf:focus frbr:concept1 .

 

lcsh:concept1 a skos:Concept ;

                skos:inScheme lcsh:scheme ;

                skos:exactMatch mesh:concept1 ;

                skos:prefLabel "The LCSH term" ;

                foaf:focus frbr:concept1 .

 

# The primary entity

frbr:concept1 a frbr:Concept ;

                frbr:hasTerm "The LCSH term" ;

                frbr:hasTerm "The MESH term" ;

                frbr:hasTerm "other term" .

 

Note that FRBR:Concept doesn't have a property to express prefLabel (and
IMO shouldn't). This same pattern would work for other types of primary
entities like frbr:Person, frbr:CorporateBody, etc.

Jeff, I have no problem with MeSH and LCSH -- those are different  
vocabularies, and often the terms are not equivalents. I'm concerned  
about future vocabularies when we've gotten vocabularies out beyond  
institutional silos and different folks want to be compatible but do  
not want to use the same display for their users. This would mean  
using the same URI but a different human display. It seems to me that  
RDF would potentially allow that, but SKOS seems to close down that  
possibility.

Karen,

Let's use you and I as an example. Assume that this FRBR Event already
exists somewhere, but doesn't have any prefLabel assigned:

ex:World_War_I a frbr:Event ;
	frbr:hasTerm "World War I" ;
	frbr:hasTerm "Great War" ;
	frbr:hasTerm "WWI" .

If you want to assign a prefLabel for your community, you could do so
like this:
	
karen:ww1 a skos:Concept ;
	skos:inScheme karen:myScheme ;
	skos:prefLabel "World War I" ;
	foaf:focus ex:World_War_I.

I could do the same for my community:

jeff:gw a skos:Concept ;
	skos:inScheme jeff:myScheme ;
	skos:prefLabel "Great War" ;
	foaf:focus ex:World_War_I .

Here is a SPARQL query that would allow your community to determine its
prefLabel for the FRBR Event:

SELECT ?prefLabel
WHERE {
	?concept 
		skos:inScheme karen:myScheme ;

}

Does this help?

Simon,

 

We appear to be using the term "extension" in different ways. I assumed
you meant it in the OWL sense:

 

"Classes provide an abstraction mechanism for grouping resources with
similar characteristics. Like RDF classes, every OWL class is associated
with a set of individuals, called the class extension."

http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Class

 

Do you have a reference I could check out for how the term is used
differently in KOS systems to indicate a set of documents instead?

 

Jeff

The extension of a KOS Concept is the set of all documents that the
Concept is about.

We are using extension in the same sense here; the set of things denoted by
a term.

For background, see e.g.  the following references:

Chan et. al (1985)  is  a collection of source materials from Cutter
onwards.

Subject indexing refers to the application of a vocabulary, which may be
more or less well structured, to indicate the content or aboutness of
documents  (Chan et. al 1985, p. xiii).

Svenonius (2000) is a very readable text on the theoretical issues in
information organization.


Subject language terms differ referentially from words used in ordinary
language. The former do not refer to objects in the real world or concepts
in a mentalistic world but to subjects. As a name of a subject, the term
Butterflies refers not to actual butterflies but rather to the set of all
indexed documents about butterflies (Svenonius 2000, p. 130).

Jeff, I'm not having trouble understanding this. I think I'm not  
getting across to you, though. I do not want for there to be a karen  
scheme and a jeff scheme. What I am advocating is that there could be  
a somebody scheme, and there could be different choices for  
prefLabels. In fact, one person's altLabel may be another person's  
prefLabel. SKOS cannot do this, but I think it could be needed. What  
it comes down to is that there could be an identified *something*

   http://something.st/aThing

and I may wish to label that as:
    aabbcc

and someone else may wish to label it as
    zzyynn

But we may want to use the same identifier for the purposes of  
interoperability and for efficiency.

To my mind, SKOS models the traditional thesaurus structure and its  
use of a human-readable *identifier* too closely. Like many of the  
other aspects that keep the "S" in "SKOS" this one I think will limit  
its usability in the end.

Simon,

 

I grabbed both books from the library and neither one appears to define
or use the term "extension".

 

The passage you quote in Svenonius (2000) is explaining "Referential
Semantics" in comparison to "Category Semantics" and "Relational
Semantics". As you quoted, this category rejects the modeling of
"objects in the real world or concepts in a mentalistic world". The
other two, however,  do not reject such modeling. I would argue that RDF
is more like an amalgamation of Category and Relational Semantics. My
feeling is that mapping a Referential Semantics perspective to RDF/OWL
would be unnecessary and awkward.

 

Returning to the original discussion, the class being discussed is
Concept, with individual concepts being its "extension" (as per OWL).
For example, I can believe that "Tumor" is an individual in the class
extension of Concept. I have a harder time believing "Tumor" is a
document or set of documents.

 

Jeff

 

We are using extension in the same sense here; the set of things denoted
by

a term.

 

For background, see e.g.  the following references:

 

Chan et. al (1985)  is  a collection of source materials from Cutter

onwards.

 

Subject indexing refers to the application of a vocabulary, which may be

more or less well structured, to indicate the content or aboutness of

documents  (Chan et. al 1985, p. xiii).

 

Svenonius (2000) is a very readable text on the theoretical issues in

information organization.

 

 

Subject language terms differ referentially from words used in ordinary

language. The former do not refer to objects in the real world or
concepts

in a mentalistic world but to subjects. As a name of a subject, the term

Butterflies refers not to actual butterflies but rather to the set of
all

indexed documents about butterflies (Svenonius 2000, p. 130).

Simon,

 

We appear to be using the term "extension" in different ways. I assumed
you meant it in the OWL sense:

 

"Classes provide an abstraction mechanism for grouping resources with
similar characteristics. Like RDF classes, every OWL class is associated
with a set of individuals, called the class extension."

http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#Class

 

Do you have a reference I could check out for how the term is used
differently in KOS systems to indicate a set of documents instead?

	Simon,

	 

	I'm confused by your statement "the Concepts have the same
extension".

 

The extension of a KOS Concept is the set of all documents that the
Concept is about.

Ah - I see the confusion here.

Tumors-The-KOS-Concept is a Concept; what it denotes is the set of Documents
which are about [Tumors-The-Biological-Objects].

For the model theoretic semantics of RDF, see Hayes (2004) -
http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/

Is it possible to get a dump of the BNB data as refined/enhanced by the Open
Bibliography project? (rather than just the SPARQL endpoint to query)

This is becoming a FAQ :)

The answer is that this is blocking on a bugfix for Virtuoso
that is preventing the dump from being done correctly. I'll
poke them again to see if there is any information on an
ETA.

Subject: [open-bibliography] Identifiers in the BNB
Message-ID: <20110211132327.GJ8394@styx.org>

The major problem with the BL dataset, quite apart 
from how things like controlled vocabularies for subjects
are handled, is the absence of identifiers (URIs ideally)
for the records and for agents (authors, editors,
publishers).

The most valuable thing the BL could do to improve
this dataset is to mint those identifiers.

There are identifiers that have been generated by the
bibliographica project but particularly for the 
agents it is a potentially error-prone process and
it would be much better if we could have them from
the horse's mouth so to speak.

Corinne, is there any chance this could happen in the
near future?

Thanks,

Hello all,

Please contribute your ideas to this initiative!

The Berkman Center for Internet & Society recently announced that it will
host a research and planning initiative for a ?Digital Public Library of
America <http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/dpla>.? With funding from the
Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, Berkman will convene a large and diverse group
of stakeholders in a planning program to define the scope, architecture,
costs and administration for a proposed Digital Public Library of America.


As part of this program, we've created a public discussion listserv and a
project wiki to help bring together representatives from the educational
community, public and research libraries, cultural organizations, state and
local government, publishers, authors, and private industry to discuss
legal, policy, and technical issues surrounding public access to
comprehensive online resources. We hope to emerge with a concrete workplan
and a governance structure that captures the consensus of representatives of
the country?s libraries, universities, archives, and museums for moving
forward together with a shared vision.

We very much hope that these tools will embody a consensus-based and
peer-produced approach, and we encourage you to participate in developing
these resources and conversations.

DPLA Wiki: http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/dpla/Main_Page

Public Discussion Listserv:
https://cyber.law.harvard.edu/lists/subscribe/dpla-discussion

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with
Rebekah Heacock, Project Coordinator, at rheacock at cyber.law.harvard.edu

Looking forward to your thoughts -
Thanks,
Maura

Announcement

The 6th Annual Open Knowledge Conference (OKCon) will take place on 30th June ? 1st July 2011 in Berlin. OKCon is a wide-ranging conference that brings together individuals and organizations from across the open knowledge spectrum for two days of presentations, workshops and exchange of ideas.

Open knowledge promises significant social and economic benefits in a wide range of areas from governance to science, culture to technology. Opening up access to content and data can radically increase access and reuse, bridge gaps, improve transparency and thus foster innovation and increase societal welfare.

In Berlin, we will be surrounded by a variety of interesting communities. These include open access and open bibliography communities to the OpenStreetMap, hacker and artist groups to the various free culture and commons research communities. We look forward to jointly discussing with all of them the latest developments and aspects of open knowledge in their work.

This is a time of great change. In addition to high profile initiatives such as Wikipedia, OpenStreetMap and the Human Genome Project, there is enormous growth among open knowledge projects and communities at all levels and in many countries. Moreover, in the last year, many governments across the world have begun opening up their data.

And it doesn?t stop there. In academia, open access to both publications and data has been gathering momentum, and similar calls to open up learning materials have been heard in education. Furthermore this gathering flood of open data plus content is the creator and driver of massive technological change. How can we make this data available, how can we connect it together, how can we use it to collaborate and share our work? We will explore these issues, and more, at OKCon 2011 in Berlin.

Topic areas

We welcome proposals on any aspect of creating, publishing or reusing content or data that is open in accordance with http://opendefinition.org. Topics include but are not limited to:

Open Data Technology
	? Storage and processing tools including nosql, triplestores, ETL and analytics
	? Visualization tools
	? Semantic Web and Linked Open Data
	? Platforms, methods and tools for creating, sharing and curating material
	? Light-weight, adaptive interaction models
	? Open, decentralized social network applications
	? Open geospatial data

Open Science and Open Data in Academic Research
	? Open license models for scientific data, adaption of licenses for special domain requirements
	? Supporting scientific workflows with open knowledge models
	? Open models for scientific innovation, for funding and for publication (?open-access?)

William, 

We are beginning to work on linking to VIAF, in the first instance to
personal names - this would cover personal names as creators and
contributors. Next step will be to link to corporate names but note that
in library practice publisher names are usually not normalised and
therefore not controlled. 

We're looking at options for providing URIs for other entities (e.g.
records) but that's a bit further down the line.

Cheers

Corine

agents it is a potentially error-prone process and
it would be much better if we could have them from
the horse's mouth so to speak.

Corinne, is there any chance this could happen in the
near future?

Thanks,
