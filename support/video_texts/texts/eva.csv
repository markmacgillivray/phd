"Who are you and what do you do","My name is Eva Giraud and i am a lecturer in Culture from the media. I started off comiung here to do a masters in Critical Theory and carried on to do a PhD in critical theory and that's still the area that i work in at the moment. Although i have moved into looking into more debates about media theory and stuff to do with cultural Studies as well."
"I have described my work in open scholarship and I'm hoping to get a bit of discussion from you to about how you use information and access information and the problems that arise when you do so or if there's no problem then great. Also if you create or publish, then a bit of feedback from that perspective would be good. So to start with could you describe in your daily work, what sorts of things you tend to do when you realise that you need to know something that you don't know. Where do you look for this, what do you do at that point?","Mine has varied quite a lot through out my PhD because i think originally i was very book orientated although i was focused on understanding key philosophies in the area where as now i focus more on journal articles and i think that more of my recent work, has been more sort of in depth understanding of particular theories and how they fit together and their contemporal relevance. I do go to a lot of journal articles and try to piece things together that way and that i suppose is where i have noticed more barriers in terms of access"
"So i imagine that you both look on-line for journals and stuff, is that common to both of you? Do you go to a library or where for you have access?","journal articles, definitely on-line I'd say. I mean there are two ways that i sort of deal with it. Obviously publishing is a bit of a game, so if there was a particular journal that i wanted to publish in,  i would go to that particular journal and look at past editions of that journal and look at look at other things that are in that particular book, because obviously there are other things that are in that Because obviously there is mapping. You know which other journals have more dialogue so you'd focus on reading round those areas i suppose."
"So you have journals that you are interested in that you go to. What has brought those ones to your attention in the first place?","That's what kind of the maps do in a way, because they do tend to use the main journals and actually it means that you can, it's a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy in a way, that these ones with the big names. They are not necessarily where the most interesting work is but they are just these points that you have to cite otherwise you are seen as somehow not fulfilling some level of academic quality. Google scholar.  I'm sure everyone does it. It's become such a kind of, I always feel really guilty because it's what you discourage undergraduates, i certainly discourage undergraduate students from just googgling stuff. It does throw up things that are more unexpected. If you are searching journal databases, it doesn't necessarily always come up so."
"So you're saying search internal databases and so what would be the alternative if you weren't looking at google?","Well obviously there are things like JACE, but i often set a list of publishers. Yes, you know, like Taylor & Francis They do have quite a lot of good journals in cultural studies and critical theory and also conveniently that university has copy write or has access to, where as i think there are quite a lot of other cultural specific journals that we don't have access to. Journals like cultural politics, or others with some really interesting things in that we don't have access to so it does push you out towards some big named ones. Big publishers that the university has a relationship with"
"OK, It seems clear then that you have both said that there are journals that you have access to, and you trust those journals to give you valid information but at the same time there are other journals that you don't have access to, but for some reason you have a desire to read them. Maybe you feel there is something in there that you should be reading?. So is there a difference in those journals, what is it that makes one of them seem as if it is something that you should reference compared to another journal where you might feel less inclined? Is there any quality that makes you think that one is better than the other?","I think a lot depends on, there are two things for me. Firstly the topic with that particular author or something that is well known in the field and it's something recent that's some out by them, then you don't have access to it then that's obviously quite frustrating and i think that's probably the point you'd send out a twitter message saying - has anyone got access to this? The other thing is sometimes i think that our areas are sometimes quite niche in some ways and so sometimes you really need to find some very specific information about something where there's not a lot written about it yet. I do a lot of stuff in the media, technologies for which i need very up to date information, a lot of people haven't written about it yet and because it's so niche there might only be one of two things that hae been written about that topic from the perspective i need and so obviously when that happens and the only article in some journal that you don't have access to, the that's very frustrating. and political reasons. So it's not just research for researches sake. It's research for making a political argument."
"If you don't have access to a particular article, because presumbably the community of your university haven't paid the fee or so on. It sounds like that doesn't mean that you think that it's not therefore valuable, you still do want access? How would you get access to it?","yes. I suppose i probably go and ask colleagues. That would be one of my first, because I've got a couple of them who always have pdf's about everything   and because we run a reading group i really noticed recently that I've been saying - I'll scan in this chapter and my colleague says oh I've got a pdf of that and he'll be my first port of call as he seems to have a lot of material like that. Then after that, i think I'd put up a message on a social networking site at work asking if they have access to it"
"The times that you do try and access these materials that you do think are important to your research - so you've tried to access it and you haven't been able to, do you feel that something has failed you in this process or do you feel that you have seen reasonable denials to your requests?","I feel frustrated i think, because the parameters change quite a lot and I'm deeply frustrated with the system because i know it's, obviously certain publishers have got monopolies on certain types of knowledge which i think from a critical theory perspective is very frustrating and that's why i think i wouldn't have qualms about trying to get access to other things. The other thing i might do actually is e-mail the author. So that if it's something that i really want to read, i have done that before, i have e-mailed somebody and they have e-mailed me recently to get something. So obviously it only works if you have some pre existing thing. But it is a nice thing to do as well i think, as people like it when you're interested in their things. I think for me, it's not the same as other forms of copy write - retaining creative control over a film, where the money is going into the film. Where as with the journal articles i don't get the sense, it's almost an anti-benefit to the author. The only reason they do it is because of the research excellence framework, you need a number. You need a certain number of things in journals, you need a certain number of things to get a job. It is very difficult to get a job as an early career researcher. So you are forced to do these things which seem to be oppositional to what you want to do. Also the boundaries are always shifting. You don't know. Every thing's got politics to it and you don't know, suddenly i can't access these journals does that mean that somewhere else someone looked to. You never know what's going on with the publisher relationships - has someone upped the rates and that's why we haven't got them or has money been going elsewhere, It's not very transparent."
"Do you feel left out of that? Or do you feel the information isn't available or do you think someone at the university is making the decisions for you or do you think it's something beyond that?","I guess it's a structural issue because for instance, we have a great library rep and we have lovely people in the information services so i don't think it's down to the individuals, i think it has to be structural problem really."
"OK, So do you think it's within the structure of your university or do you think it's imposed?","I think it's both ways"
"So we were just starting to move away from the idea of looking for information, you have both described as been desperate to get hold of for your work. When you do get that information you are happy and when you don't you use the tools that are available and other means and then you mentioned that you think these things come up because people are publishing for REF frame work or are needing a career progression so, have either of you published any material and when you published did you feel different given you have been on the other side? What thoughts went through your head when you shared your creative work?","I think i felt quite uncomfortable. There was one thing, the only other things i had published were in an open access context and a short   which i hope never sees the light of day, or no-ones read, it was terrible. But i had something recently in a journal, a well known and respected journal in our field so i was really pleased and the peer review process was amazing. I didn't expect it but i got amazing feedback and it was like being part of a knowledge community. It was really helpful and really great and i thought, this is how it should be. This is what peer review should be about. The when it got published it was difficult for people to get access to and it was quite nice because i did get a couple of e-mails from people saying could you e-mail me the article but officially the way i should have done it was, you get a link fro the publisher saying you get 23 downloads and to share the link with your friends. You were supposed to spread this link with your friends so they could read your article and i thought that's cool Then my first horrible thought was -  OK that will look good for me in terms of stats and hits to link to my article and then i thought - that's hideous. So I've not shared it with anyone but if someone e-mails me asking for a copy of the article I'll share it with them. Well it depends, I've had some horrible ones too. I think it's one of these things that because of RAG and because of undue pressure on it when what it's fundamentally about is supporting you as a researcher and giving you constructive feedback and I've had a few rejctions but i feel that the process has been almost an extension of my PhD of where I've developed my work. It's been really helpful exen though it's not nice to be rejected. Some of the feedback has been just as helpful and honed my work in a particular way. So i do think it's a way to be positive but the REf seems to be a marker."
"So you strongly feel you got value from the peer review process even when you got negative","It depends. The peer review process with the one i got published was great. I had another one that got rejected but the review was so full and helpful that it pointed me towards some interesting stuff that i feel it really enhanced a lot of what i was doing. I've had one that's been un-constructive and i can look at it now and laugh. At the time when you get it it's awful but you look back and think - some of those criticisms were valid and some were someone coming from a different perspective."
"So you mentioned that the idea of being published in intimidating and you described that sometimes the process of getting published can be a nightmare. Do you think that puts you or people off doing that in a public fashion. Would it comfort you if that process was done privately or were you exposed, did you feel the commentary on your work should be made available to other people or not?","It's quite a personal thing and especially for a young academic, one of the things you have to do, which i think is wrong is develop a thick skin to do it. In the same way that you might go to an academic conference and have someone is not interested and they'll say - I've got a question, and it's not a question it's a five minute rant about what they're doing and probably an aggressive attack on what you're doing. That makes you feel bad, it's not constructive. Unfortunately that can happen in the peer review process. I have had great experiences but i've heard and seen that and some of my colleagues who are well published and well known get that from their work just because their work is valid i think and i think for that to happen in a public forum as a PhD student could be problematic, demoralising and humiliating. I think the question is more, to what extent does the whole system need to be changed in order for that to work as a thing, because i do think things are changing slowly. I think people have got more concerned about being constructive and have slowly realised that you can't be so dismissive of people and you can't be, i think it's changing but i don't know if"
"So i want to describe an example and see what your take on it is. The field i work in is development, there are more open source there are a lot ways in which i can do my work publicly and one of the things I've realised, over time is that i'm very good at doing my work publicly and taking those criticisms, simply due to experience so by default everything we do is visible from the start and that means you have some awful stuff from the start and things you created years ago and look back on and you can see yourself how bad you were at the time as it's visible and so we get used to that and from that certain communities have grown up where you  can go to a web site and you can ask questions and people give you feedback on those questions and the kinds of things you're describing where they give you feedback which is really just an attack, you could say  - well that's ust a stupid question or rather than answer your question they give you their rebuttal and their preferred answer which doesn't answer your question. Those things become quite well handled because it's public. As long as the majority of the community are of the same opinion, that it's better to be constructive, then the +1 system is basically so that people can't come at you in less useful ways get discounted. Do you think the idea od making it more public would help or hinder the process?","It really depends i think. There are things we are doing at the centre that i think are nice. For example, Josh and i have placed the blogs up and I've re-read the blog and I've thought it's not very good but because we have a nice community, i have ended up chatting with other people about the article who have read it and i think you had left a comment and think about stuff in a different way. So i think its useful in terms of having informal spaces and creating a culture around that as a good testing round for ideas and things"
"Given that say, Eva could be doing that in a public space on your blog, pseudo public in your group and you can provide feedback. If you are somewhere and engaging with that work at an early stage and you're   the idea of finality to a piece of research, For both of you, what do you think would answer that question, what makes that work final, who would be involved? Let's say you'd published, would you feel comfortable say referencing a link to Eva's blog, would you feel comfortable knowing someone had done that or would you prefer that Eva had it in a journal?","I think it's fine, i quite like it when people have fragments of things. It's all to do with context. If you just reference fragments of things, then you know, but often those fragments build on stuff that's already out there. So for example the blog about the horse meat scandal, there's been that one thing that's been written about that in a journal because that's quite recent. There have been some reviews written about the text it's referring to and so piecing those things together even though they are not the most formal published journal articles. If i was writing a more formal article about horse meat I'd maybe use that to say well this has been touched on by these people but i am going to elaborate on these ideas and build on them"
"If academic rigour is illustrated by something like peer review which you don't get on a blog, what is about peer review or any other public place or location that makes you believe that that rigour has been achieved?","I suppose as researchers you have reached a certain level of knowing your field and often it's to do with my engagement with that journal, so i wouldn't just assume that because somethings in it, you wouldn't expect a level of peer review of a  journal with a certain level of reputation or whatever. It doesn't necessarily guarantee it, especially if it's from a different disciplinary perspective. They might be just working through ideas that have happened elsewhere at different points. I think it's to do with what you bring to it as well and how you interpret things. What i see as really useful, is that you know the key things in your field, the key developments and good peer review should be about that you have filled in those gaps and you have got all the context and that you're not trying to claim something that's novel that's been done. It should be about producing knowledge, that's what it's about. It's not about publishing for the sake of it and if you're rehashing something that's been said elsewhere but trying to give it a new label then that isn't about producing knowledge that's just publishing for the sake of publishing. That's where peer review is very useful from preventing that from happening and trying to make sure that you're trying to make a genuine contribution and move debates on."
"Can you give me some idea of what do you think over your recent careers/studies what things have changed a lot or what do you think will change in the future about how you access information and are those things you think you will be involved in or things that you think will happen to you?","It's like you have to do things that you don't necessarily want to do because that's what's recognised currently Although there are major shifts now where everything is moving towards open access models in the UK. I think some of my friends have been involved in stuff like Caroline Edwards that's an ex-student here. She's been involved with work to do with open access models for humanities that are like the +1 model and things like that. So i think there is a push on one level for open access for the broader scale, sort of governmental shifts which i don't know if that's going to be enacted so it's mutually beneficial to everybody. I don't know if the motivations are geared towards the genuine production of knowledge. On the other hand, our discipline is quite political and i know that Colin's work, he was keen to have it downloaded for free on open access because of political commitments and i think that within our discipline there is that desire to try and make things freely available. It's just difficult for researchers to do that at the moment. I think it is changing though, slowly"
"Given that you're at different stages of your careers but you are moving in the same direction for research and getting involved more in the scholarly process, do you think that any of these changes are up to you or is there anything that you can do? For example Eva you must be closer to the people who make decisions on who gets what job rather than a student is?","No comment on that at the moment. I think that at the moment we have shifted to a very precarious tine for early career researchers and people on general so i really think it's really difficult time for people and it pushes you towards more conventional models really."
"I feel from what I'm trying to learn, that there is a lack of clarity where this push is coming from that I'm trying to discover?","I think what's really difficult is to get a job - there is an informal hierarchy that you're not necessarily aware of, where it's not just that you have stuff published but where you've been published and stuff like that and it's because of the REF in the large part and because of certain traditions and you don't necessarily know about those things. Even in terms of publishers there's hierarchy of which publishers are the best to publish in. A lot of academics don't know about and those that do know these things have generally got an insight. I think it's partly tradition and partly this push to be able to qualify for things, to quantify knowledge. If it's peer reviewed then that can be quantified on a good piece of work. I think it's those two and that it's a cultural thing. I think it's to do with the new globalisation of the university - thought I'd get that in there. But it is to do with being able to say OK, it is being used in a very specific way to say we are going to put this person on a personal teaching contract, Not in our department i would say, but I've heard of other institutions, being told that they are going to be put on teaching contracts because you have not met this number of publications. So it is useful to write   to make employment more precarious for evample or to lower people's salaries."
