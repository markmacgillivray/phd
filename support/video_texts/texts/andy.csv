"Andy if you wouldn't mind introducing yourself and what it is that you do here","I'm Andy McGregor, i just got a new job so from the 1st January I'm now Deputy Chief Innovation Officer here at Jisc. Obviously it's a new job so it's still being defined but mainly it means that I'll have responsibility for defining the approach which Jisc takes to doing innovation. So my job is mainly process based. We're going to be using an approach to innovation that we've been piloting for the past year called Co-design and that's now been in used for all Jisc projects. It's my job to scale it up and to make sure the Jisc projects can work with them and all new projects come from that process. Obviously I'll oversee the projects that come out of that, the innovation projects that come out of that process. So it is a process based job now."
"So if we start going from the past through to the present. You discussed what you're going with the Co-design. What have you been doing in the last few years that has led to this idea, what is the focus of this Co-design thing and why have you come to it?","So the reason Jisc is interested in Co-design is because of the Wilson review. So in 2010 amid the financial crisis the government had a look at all the various organizations that were funded by the government. Jisc was reviewed by Wilson. That's why it's called the Wilson review and he had a number of things to say about all aspects of Jisc but innovation he had a few particular things to say about, one - that we did too many things, two - that they didn't always have the impact they should have because we were probably doing too many things and three - the process by which some of those things were agreed and started was often opaque. So Co-design as an approach innovation was a response to that to try and address some of those concerns. It does that by ensuring that key stake holders for the sector, the people who are going to use the things that innovation produces are involved in the process right from the very start and right throughout. So i don't mean that they are just consulted or they are used as a steering group. They are actually the people who we work with in a collaborative way to define what we are going to do, how are we going to do it and if we do it what success looks like for them. So last year we piloted that and the pilot was successful enough for us to scale it up. So that's the organizational reason. For me, what's led to that is, I've worked here in Jisc for about six or seven years now and throughout that time I've been involved in project in a number of different areas. I don't really have any expertise in a library background. I don't really have expertise in these. I can understand the technical stuff but I'm not technical. So i started off with repositories. I did activity data, open data, resource discovery. Quite a lot of library stuff and quite a lot of developer community stuff and a few bits around different types of innovation processes and throughout that, the common thread was, that i was interested in, were processes that define how we engage the creative people in higher education and how we engage them, how we ensure that all their creativity benefited as many people as possible. So i got more and more interested in the processes rather than the actually subjects where as my colleagues are more interested in the subject. So there research data programme manager they research data or the might be really interested in open data. I ended up being more and more interested in the processes and that's what i love focussing on and so when the Jisc leadership decided they wanted someone to look at processes, look at this new co-design approach and implement it, it was fortunate for me that i happened to have some spare time. Having expressed interest in this area that they asked me to look at and so i was able to take the outline of this process they defined, design the process and implement it. It has been a slow process over a number of years, moving away from expressing an interest in the sole object of what Jisc does and more about how Jisc does it. That's personally how Co-design came about for me."
"Could you say a bit more about who the stake holders are that you are interested in engaging with and why you want to engage with them more?","Co-design is still very much a rough thing. It's not polished yet, it might not ever be polished. Polished is the enemy of good process because it ridgefies it and rigid hierarchies in many studies have shown to be counter-productive for innovation. So at the moment it's rough and we're developing it and polishing it but stake holders are one of the things that we have put more thought into because it's at the heart of it. As far as i see it there are three levels of engagement for stakeholders. The top is the kind of strategist level. Those are the people who are almost a kin to the organization who do say - this is what we want done, these are our needs and this is what we want done to address our needs. If you are going to successfully address these needs, this is what you need to do. So essentially they give you a strategic direction a strategic imperative for setting off in a direction. The co-designers at that level you would expect to be people like directors of IT, people like senior librarians, people like heads of E-learning, people like planners, finance directors, registrars. Essentially the people who organize in the institution, the college, the university etc who would be ultimately the people who would be signing off on the adoption of any product that was produced by innovation. They would make a decision whether to buy it. So they are the ultimate customer. They represent the people who if we're going to produce something, it has to meet their needs to be successful. So they operate at the strategist level. The next level down is the designer level. So once the strategist has identified a problem or an area of investigation or opportunity or idea. The experts from higher education institution s, from commercial organizations, from really anyone that's relevant. Jisc would convene them to work out how to go about addressing that opportunity or that problem and that would be the design stage and that could be broad array of people could be engaged in that area of design. From your expert developers through to your practitioners through to the senior managers who could again be involved in that level, people outside of the sectors such as commercial people could be involved, consultants such as Cottage Labs, people like that would be relevant there, people from government. You could imagine a vast different array. The point of that is that is supposed to be flexible diverse cause study after study shows that for innovation to work, diversity is the key ingredient to making innovation successful. So those are there and at the base level after you have designed something, you have to do it. So you've got the developer's, the doers whatever you want to call them, the implementers. The people who would go away and deliver the design. That's how i view Co-design, kind of these three stages of engagement and people could be engaged to co-design a project at any one of those levels. In the pilot we generally call people at the strategy level the co-designees, but really we've engaged a broad array of people to help us design and deliver the project and it's probably not that new to Jisc. We have always engaged widely what's different now is the systematised and the strategy level, the top level where people are involved much earlier in the decision process that they were before making it much more transparent and open in terms of what we're doing and why we're doing it and who we're doing it for."
"So in terms of making it more transparent and open from top to bottom, what have been the reasons for you to want to make it more transparent and open? Are there particular benefits that you are seeing there or particular social concerns that you want to meet with that?","Well the Wilson review is one. The Wilson review did state that some Jisc processes were opaque and needed to be addressed and we did not meet customer needs. But obviously transparency has an enormous amount of benefits for innovation in general i think. One of which is diversity. Transparency enables people to be aware of what's happening and to be aware of how they can get involved and how it fits with the things they're doing and that leads to greater serendipity, greater knowledge spill over between different projects, greater diversity of input which should lead to stronger ideas. It also should lead in theory to more work done in the margins. Obviously organizations like 3M show and in fact research in general shows that lots of interesting stuff happens in the margins. So where disciplines meet or the margins where technologies meet. IN 3M for example i read that they developed a glue that was so strong it could be used for sound dampening in air craft engines. You wouldn't think that glue could do something like that but it's because they have these intersections, these margins where they are able to do interesting things like that. I think transparency is one of the key things to help leave the opportunity open for those kind of interesting things to arise in the margins. Finally i think it's important for people, obviously Jisc works with public money or institutions money so it's important for them to know purely where their money is spent and why it's spent and how it's being done. I think that is important anyway because it's a general principal. I think there are a number of reasons - Wilson, innovation reasons and just plain good management reasons. I think transparency for all of those reasons."
"With such a level of transparency and sharing of ideas, have you experienced any difficulties with say a more traditional scholarly approach which might involve people keeping ideas to themselves and wanting to be very much the producer of information or the lead name of a particular idea? Has that impacted your work?","It has. But often not as much as feared, i have found. One example is we developed a site called Jisc Elevator. This is a site where people can put ideas, generally for small projects on the site. They do a video picture of their idea and a short description, people can vote on that idea and if successful they get funded. We have used that a couple of times now and one of the key arguments against doing Elevator, in the early days when we were said should we do it, people said people don't like sharing their ideas and i had some experience of that previously where we'd issued a call for funding and we'd tried to get, encourage people to be openly sharing ideas beforehand and only two people did. We got quite a few bits back but only two people shared them. Probably just coincidence but those two were two of the strongest bids. I don't know if you can draw any conclusions from this as it's a small number. But never the less it was interesting. But innovator, we just haven't experienced any problems. People are very happy to put their ideas on there, very happy to share them openly. These are small ideas and that may be the difference and often their not researched in a way they are innovation which you could say, innovations the step after research. Research happens to invent something and then innovation comes along to make use of that. Amongst students particularly, so the recent Elovation competition was aimed at students and they had no fear, no qualms what so ever about sharing their ideas publicly. But that does contradict with previous things where we've tried to encourage openness and it hasn't happened. Although the difference is, Elevator required openness where you share your ideas openly and people are fine with that. We encouraged it and made a requirement of it. It didn't happen so there was no incentive to do it there i guess other than for it suited your own personal way of working. Maybe it's not that common in academia. I don't want too make to many suppositions there as it's not an area i know a lot about. My experience is, certainly with Elevator, they are quite happy to share ideas generally."
"Would you say that they had a reason to do so with the Elevator? If it was mandated that they must share them and then presumably ones that get elevated get something in return for having shared them. Did you see from the sharing itself that more things emerge other than just say being the best one and being pitched as the best one? Did you get any other interesting things coming up because of the sharing going on?","Yes. In a few cases, again we've run the Elevator twice. We've had twenty six ideas submitted the first time, the second time thirty six.So they're not enormous amounts of ideas. They didn't get an enormous amount of traction. But certainly on both times we've allowed people to comment on ideas and interesting comments have been put on. Sometimes saying this will never work, sometimes have you seen someone has already done the idea, sometimes saying I'm interested and they'd like to be involved and sometimes people have contacted people. I know for example a commercial organisation contacted one of the students before they got funded because they were interested in their idea. So yes there have been some inside benefits in terms of  making contacts, networking and sometimes learning that there's other things going on. But not perhaps as much as there could be. One of the things I'd really like to see Elevator do in terms of something we've always intended from the start is move from a demand exercise which is essentially what it is at the moment we put an idea up there and we assess the demand for it in terms of votes, to some kind of team forming exercise. I think that's how it would work in an ideal world. Someone would put an idea up there, a team would form around the idea. So people who could help deliver certain things about the idea or work together or look for an opportunity to trial the idea or offer expertise or critical mentorship for the idea any kind of addition for it and then instead of the most popular idea getting funded, the strongest team ends up getting funded around the idea. So it's a more practical instance, the level of excitement about the idea, to gauge the level of excitement and the acceptability of the idea. People who are actually dedicating time and effort or saying they will give time and effort to an idea seems to be a stronger thing than a lot of people ust saying - Yes, I quite like that. So in an ideal world if we could make that work, i think it's quite complex to make it work but in an ideal word that's how I'd like to see it working and i think that could kind of get at some of the things, the reason behind the question of what are the other benefits to being open i think that's a really interesting prospect that I'd like to have time to explore."
"It would be quite interesting to stick with that for a bit considering what you are doing now in regards to that because the idea of collecting around the idea of getting people to commit time to it obviously gives you a bit of follow up because you have not just an idea of people who will then go and work on it. Have you any of your own ideas yet about, there's a lot of barriers to being able to form a team like that because the makeup of the way humans interact, like we may be at different universities, some of us are at organizations, some of us are commercial, some of us are in places like Jisc which has a different position to say the universities themselves and so on. Have you any ideas on how you might tackle those problems, of say three or four different people all from these different kinds of place, they all want to work on an idea but how would you help them do so? In terms of what you're thinking of, your personal interest in the idea of moving to the processes and of having this sort of Co- design and the later things going on. What do you feel are the issues that might be, like you said it might be hard to enable this, so what do you think is stopping it at the moment if anything?","The main thing is two things, one - just a very practical issue of getting a website to do that elegantly isn't trivial. It's easy to do voting there is a drupal plugin. It's simple. Working out the mechanism to form a team is much more difficult than voting cause team formation is quite, start ups say the thing that you should always focus on you should start early and focus on the hiring of the team. Formation is one of the most important things and to expect that to coalesce magically around an idea is a bit fanciful. So i think it would need some kind of, in my experience that doesn't happen naturally. People saying - Yes, let's work together,  I've just never seen that happen before in a virtual way. I've seen it happen before in a physical way, face to face meetings. But never in a virtual way. So getting over those practical web problems initially is what I'm talking about  and then there's the issue of choice of ownership and things like that. So you've put your idea up there and then would you really ust want to have anyone available in the community to work with you on it. Probably you wouldn't want to leave it that open an idea. Here's my idea and anyone could work openly. There's a study done by musicals. I forget who it was done by and what the name of it was but they developed something called a Que something or other a Que ratio or something and what they did was they studied the success of the musicals and the make up pf the teams behind them and they found there's streets wide diversity between them. Teams who all knew each other and teams where no-one knew each other. It seemed like the sweet spot was teams that mostly knew each other but with some new people. Enough to bring in new ideas to challenge the status quo. So enough to have a successful way of working and understand each others way of working and just be successful as a team but that thirst of new ideas, challenges to break open assumptions or to try new ways of doing it. To bring in fresh new ideas and that's why i imagine you'd need on something like that, what you'd want is a team to come up with that idea and a team that's newly formed and for them to say what else do we need in terms of expertise or to be open to things they hadn't thought of or people they hadn't thought of getting involved. There is also another example of something like this where the website site like inocentive. Inocentive is an open innovation website where companies have problems and they say - we're having a problem with this chemical engineering issue and ask them to solve it. They frequently solve the problems that are up there but they frequently solve  i can't remember the exact figures but they are often solved by people in a different discipline who have seen the idea up there. So i think rather than just a complete team formation you'd want something like that probably because a complete team would be fanciful and wouldn't be ideal, a team of strangers. So i think to do it properly you'd need that kind of thought  and I'm thinking on my feet as I've not thought about it enough. I think that's what you'd need, it's one aspect of it. The second aspect of it and the more practical aspect of it is say for example you'd got a good team a team with a core of people who knew each other and all knew the idea but with some fresh new people coming in as part of the process. Then you'd have to tackle the other practical issues around how they work together and that's something we have quite a lot of experience in in Jisc. A lot of the work we do is with distributed people and distributed teams rather than co-located teams just as Jisc as an organization itself is  distributed and co-located. Most of my colleagues are elsewhere. I don't think that's uncommon now in academia. More and more teams are geographically distributed. I'm not sure it's completely optimal in a lot of ways. Certainly methodology like agile, assume and co-location.You see start ups again and start ups in innovative tech companies spend an enormous amount of time thinking about who sits where in the office and that sort of thing. I met one the other day where they change their seating arrangement every two months making sure that the right personalities are sitting with each other. So it shows co-location is incredibly important but we don't always have that luxury. So we have to find ways around that and using things like Google docs. depending on what you're doing but Google docs. Github, blogs, more corporate systems like sharepoint all that kind of thing is really important. Also finding methodologies that work is also important. So Agile works extremely well for technology projects but if you're a distributed team it's not really designed for you. Assume is co-location and meeting standard and all that kind of stuff. But you can still use the same principal in a distributed team, regular conversations, not planning in detail too far ahead, making yourself able to change direction and pivot as things happen and so i think taking all those principals and apply it to your team but you just have to be aware of that and plan slightly differently. That's even more difficult if say ninety percent of the team are located in one place and ten percent are located elsewhere. How do you stop that person becoming disconnected, marginalised? their opinions, feeling frustrated that nothing their doing is.  So there are all of those issued with team building which is why virtually going the other way is easier, it gets us somewhere. But in an ideal world, i think if we are, someone said to me just today that often in innovation people focus too much on ideas and less on execution and i worry that something like the Elevator is doing that. It is focused on ideas because there is a demand for ideas but if we really wanted to do this well we'd focus on execution. So how we form the team, who's in the team, how they work together and focusing in detail on that may well end up with better results. Initially putting all your focus on the ideas but obviously as i say it's not terribly straight forward to do that."
"You've clearly got a lot of interest in your work but also personally cause of the way you like to think about it, how to get people to work more like this and how to get people to collaborate. What reason do you personally have for wanting to get that? Apart from being interested in the processes that go on, what's your end goal, why is it worthwhile to try and help people to do this?","I haven't had much time to think about this. It's something i do because I'm supposed to do it. So it's what someones asked me to do! I guess it's because to some extent i think the things that we're doing and if they are done well are worthwhile. They are worth doing. If Jisc can act as an agent that can help people produce things that do help universities and colleges do things better help improve the student experience that's something that's worth doing. It's  goal. It's interesting. I guess if i was trying to be less lofty I'd say it's because your competitive i think as well cause you want to make sure that what you do is good and you've got pride in what you do and you want to make sure the things you do are good. So you spend a lot of time thinking about how to do them better. I also think that I'm very fidgety from the video you'll have noticed, but in my mind I'm very fidgety i get restless very easily and then I'm never happy I'm never satisfied. I always want to improve things and when processes improve it seems to be an itch i can't scratch. When i see something and I've done something i think OK i could have done it this way, i could have done it that way i want to do it better next time. So there's always that kind of almost personal dissatisfaction that drives you on to do things. I think all of that would be the same even if i perhaps didn't believe in it as much as i do, but i think that plus the fact i do think that what Jisc does and especially the university of higher education sector does is worthwhile and important and is exciting. I think those two together make you want to try and do things better and improve things."
"So in your own process of looking at what you've done and trying t tweak it and prove it, you've already mentioned things that you have heard about and how they act and different forms of research where you've seen people have said x and y situations will have an affect. Where do you find out about these kinds of things, how do you personally access the information that helps you to make these decisions and how do you share the things that you've learnt?","This is something that I'm permanently dissatisfied with. I have never found anything that made me happy. The one that I'm getting enough of what i need to read, there's always a real restlessness there - how can i get more things. I mean I've very little with patience, I'm very impatient with things. I don't tend to read modular scholar research because i don't tend to operate at that level of detail. That detail tends to be extraneous to me so i want to digest it a level above. But one of the things i am dissatisfied with is sharing, that's the most frustrating thing - how do we share effectively what we've learned? So generally i suppose my methods are three things. One is haphazard clicking. I would say the majority of what i do is haphazard clicking. I'll spend happily a couple of hours a day in work or out of work on my phone or whatever just clicking away and following things. Not like I've scheduled that time but it;s just what i do. I'll read something that will lead to something that will lead to something and that haphazard clicking now is generally quite a satisfying process. I don't, because of the level of detail I'm doing i don't tend to hit upon payables that often or if i do it tends to be books I'm paying for than other forms of research. I've just realised i don't  i don't know why. So that's haphazard clicking and that can be any source but it tends to rely on free data like wikipedia and blogs, magazines, places like the Orion Radar, Harvard Business Review, newspapers and that often leads you to something more detailed like books. So last year i started to read a lot more non-fiction. I read a lot about economics and innovation and statistics and predictions and complexities and things like that and that's all lead to stuff that interests me in a personal capacity and a work capacity. The third ones is social networks. I would say that's fairly massive. Most of the really genuinely new and interesting stuff that i hadn't followed for my own interest, that's the thing about the Google filter bubble is the social networks, there's where i get things that come out of the blue and surprise me from things like twitter and so on. But the most important thing is, and this is something that i read about again and again in books on innovation is talking, it's probably the least efficient but most effective method of finding out new things. So I'll start talking to someone in the office about something i read and half understood about statistics or something and then they'll tell me something else or a book they're reading and then I'll go off  and that's generally the most effective thing. I'll tell them about something I've read that i think is brilliant and they'll tell me it's rubbish for reasons i hadn't realised. Then that will send me off down another route. When i think about trying to systematise this better and trying to do this better that's often the bit i neglect. I often don;t think that     is inefficient it's haphazard. But i do think it's the single most effective thing, i remember reading about the economics of football and they were talking about how Britain is often tactically behind other nations in British football and that was because of our separation in both in terms of geographical separation from the European continent where the innovations are coming from. Places like Holland and Spain. Spain more recently, but Holland and Germany in the seventies and so on and it's only recently that we've started to catch up. It's people talking and sharing of information that is really key to making sure that people advance and you see geographical corporations like Silicon Valley based on the fact of sharing knowledge so some innovation books call it knowledge pull over. The ability to make sure that you're in the conversation that you are networking with people who have these ideas and doing things differently to make it challenging and they said the in this book about football is you often see the most successful managers are more networked. They talked specifically about Sir Alex Ferguson and said he spends an enormous amount of time on the phone or talking to other managers in what could seem like, if you were auditing it from the outside, casual chatter but that was an essential way he found out about all sorts of other stuff that was going around you know players that were available, tactics, ideas all of that kind of stuff. As i get old from experience i realised how much more important that was. So from experience I've realised how important that was. I mean five years or ten years ago i would have said that we could do it on line better by book marking it or something like that. But now if i spend all of my day in meetings just talking to people then to some extent probably no work gets done, it's a day wasted. As long as it wasn't a frustrating conversation or going round in circles i would now envisage that to be an effective way to start sharing knowledge and learning stuff. It's a rambling answer"
"Do you have any particular point say that are coming up in the next year or so that you'd like to discuss before we finish up? Anything that you think is going to have a large affect on the way that you access information or on they way that these projects you are working on might develop? Have you had any flashes of inspiration on how you might tackle this problem first or is there anything you're waiting to see emerge soon?","No. But i have hopes in a number of areas just now i guess but i don't know if there is anything in particular. I am quite excited by things like the open data institute i think. That kind of practical use of open data and open data sharing is quite exciting. But i don't know how much that will impact the project we're working on at the moment. That's one of the interesting things is that a lot what we're going to be doing in the next year or so is fairly near term stuff so service development, product development that kind of stuff so things that aren't speculative or experimental but things that are fairly safe bets. So I'd of thought that because they are near term stuff then a lot of the interesting things that are developing may not have that much of an impact in the next year or so. I mean obviously things like open access and things like that are getting more prevalent and will have an interesting impact but i wonder if that's a bit further ahead than what we'll be doing now. I can't think of anything in particular that would be terribly important or interesting. That's probably shortsighted of me, one of the things that this job has taught me over the last seven years is that my predictions and opinions aren't worth anything. They have so often been proved wrong. I think that making predictions in this are is often not worth the paper they are written on. I can't think of anything in particular"
