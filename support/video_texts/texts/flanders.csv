"Who are you and what do you do","My current role is research community manager within University of Melbourne.But previous to this I've spent the past 5 years working for funding agencies. So the joint information systems committee in the UK and i worked for the Australian National Data Service in Australia and actually. I am currently working with the National Research cloud project Nectar which is still partly mine. So i continue to play a role within the funding Agency, so naturally the kind of mandates and the stuff you put on research whether that's open access or open tools for the research cloud, or open data with the Australian National data service,  Basically in each one of the roles I've had as a funding agency, open has played in trying to make those decisions and most importantly trying to justify those decisions."
"So what has been the main impact of the open versus closed debate for you? Have you always very much been on this side of getting funding out for people that are or aren't doing open or has it impacted? Did it impact you personally trying to access materials or publish materials?","Sure. I guess for me other than the broad sweeping arguments of, you can hear my accent I'm American so even though i have British citizenship and I'm applying for Australian citizenship. I've always been very sensitive to the fact that in spending tax payer money whether it be in the US, UK or Australia, that's what you're doing right and it's scary to look at someone who pays taxes and say - i'm spending your money and yet i don't have the same accent as you or the same ideals of user patriotism as you. That type of thing, so that's always mattered to me, to be defending that at a very real level. Now that's nice as a broad sweeping argument, but the moment you get into the long tailed discussion of kind of opening up something like bio-medical data or something and you get into a conversation about anonomizing it or de-identifying it, there's a very long tailed discussion that has to occur in each one of the different disciplines and all the rest of it. For better or worse i feel that it does basically improve the rate and the speed of which scholarship occurs. If you can get the problems out of the way, if we can come up with a good de-identification or way of anonymizing the data, or tools or whatever, in a way that it can be made open then i actually feel that what that will do for researchers is that it will get them more research funding and save them time. So it comes down to a very real thing where researchers actually can say - because i opened up my data and put in that extra effort to anonymize it and now it's out there in the open, then said researcher across the country, the globe and I've seen this, I've friends, i'm much more closer to. People talk about international like they know what it it is, I've seen it. I've got a meta researcher in Oxford who's worked with a researcher in Melbourne who I've then connected to a researcher, you know who's in Sandeago and that's very real. It's a very small group but then they do really amazing and cool things. Most of the time it's the data, the tools, the method or the publication that's enabled them to participate and do things with that. So it isn't even about open. The word i use more than anything else is collaborative. Open enables collaboration.  Open is not a means to an end, collaboration is where we want to get researchers doing things and that involves all the problems of human psychology, of trust, of relationships and all the rest of it. But open is at least one pillar inside it being able to accelerate that place where we can collaborate that."
"In the past, was there a clear time where this distinction started to emerge? Where you started to realise that there was a requirement to make it clear that people should share, or that they could share? Was there a distinct shift during the time you were working where suddenly people were more or less interested in how things actually got diseminated or accessed or has it always been the case that where you worked at least you've been trying to get people to collaborate, regardless of","Sure. I guess the communities I've experienced, and the reason i'm so. I want other people to see the open source community and the developers community. It's the community to me that exemplifies or typifies what can be achieved when people start to work in the open and allow things to be shared quickly and all the rest of it. I mean, the Linux community, the MIAS QL community. My problem with my first experience with openness war round my MIAS QL. This massive database could be used anywhere, i could write in MIAS QL. I was a database developer in a very previous life and as a young person out of under grad who was doing database management that would have been my first experience and then you tend to look up and outside it wasn't just MIAS QL there was all these other things happening. My career has actually allotted to 15 years of    for being a database developer. You just realise how amazing it is with all the opens that are out there. I love open hardware right now, reprinting and sharing all of that stuff is amazing but there is another hundred of those opens that all provide that same thing. All that by opening up what they're doing, they create more collaboration and they do what humans want to do which is socialise, share things, trust one another to produce better things that actually we can't do as individuals anymore and we have to do it in group scenarios in group things."
"What then more recently have you been working on, or are you working on at the moment where these working practices are typified? How does that benefit people now? You might find that you are connecting people up and they are getting collaboration and so what sort of outputs are you seeing from that kind of work?","I'm glad to talk about obviously the research cloud. That's the open stack and that's enabled to allow people to work on things together. I can talk about that. I could also talk about the community aspects building of that. For me what's really amazing is that i actually don't believe you can have community unless you have open. Open builds trust. Trust builds community. So are either of those you'd be interested in?"
"The community aspects i guess, but if it related to being a community around a technology then a bit of that but not the technical details.","So i think the thing that i'm most passionate about and care about right now is the research cloud and so we're using a piece of technology called Open Stac which is a bit like Amazon web services. But the cool thing about it is again isn't the technology, it's the fact that it allows us to openly share things. One of my favourite examples is what i call the ball of clay example, which is, normally people have got Tab software, 3-D software and the problem with that is that you're doing it by yourself. It's like you standing over a ball of clay and doing the whole thing together so it's cut scene and now imagine ghost and there's a ball of clay between the two of us. Being able to both put our hands on that and form it together, that's the amazing possibility of collaboration. So it took an open piece of technology to enable that, researcher doesn't even know it's called open stac, they ust know that they now have this share of a piece of software that they're using sitting on the cloud and it enables them to be both looking at this thing with one another and it's interesting as open stac is now open, but the software we're using isn't necessarily open. But it's enough open that it's enabled the collaboration in the community and that's what's exciting, because once you have two people using that, all of a sudden the ability to scale out and bring more and more people into the all of clay problem and that's what's cool. Unlike the physical enironment wher you can only maybe fit six hands on the ball of clay, in the digital space there is an upward number."
"So you mentioned there that another researcher doesn't know that it's called open stac or depending on the research you may not be aware of the software or any of the technology going on behind it. So what is it that you think is helping you to engage with researchers then to bring them into that, what particular aspect is it that makes them get engaged with what you're providing? Makes them change their mind or join this collaboration?","It literally is the opportunity to collaborate. The whole point is that researchers feel alone and isolated in using their tools. I mean we did a tool audit of researchers at the Uni of Melbourne and we think, it's a very broad structure, back of a napkin time numbers right. Each department, five or six research tools, N number of departments times N number of international collaborations, subdivided by some core tools that people use. So we think it's like two hundred to five hundred tools sit on any given research canvas. Which isn't all that shocking really, i think that's pretty normal. But the point of that is that you do feel really alone in these tools. So a linguist doing tree maps will have these really niche bits of software which are really cool and powerful for them but they are actually quite old and one of the most difficult things is that they eventually get the thing up and working but then you're like well how do i do this? So the ability to turn around and ask somebody how to do that is really powerful and the other interesting side to that coin is, this is something I'm very passionate about, is you're never going to provide a help desk for that. That's one of the problems. IT, the traditional solution has been - here is a tool, let's provide a help desk. Hi i'm the researcher, I'm working on Indonesian languages from the sixth period such and such and i want to produce a tree diagram which works with this language and bridges to this language. That's impossible, We are never going to get a help desk for that type of thing. The only solution in this is community and collaboration, ergo back to my original point. If you don't have open, that's the other point, it enables more open. The diconomy of us buying a bunch of software to make it open. So we buy a site license that now allows us to use a piece of software so that it feels open to everybody on the campus. But the sad part is that that is kind of limiting because what we actually want to do is to make sure that our researcher working with the African researcher, with the Indian researcher or the Chinese researcher also has access to that tool and all of a sudden we are getting problems when in fact, they would much rather Skye their colleagues in Indian than necessarily turn around and ask someone round the corner?"
"Are you seeing examples of where that sort of support is starting to build up within the communities? Where a particular researcher with a problem can go and ask for help, where might they do that?","That's my obsession. Community building is everything for me because it's not a science, it's definitely an art. It would depend on which discipline as well. For example the linguist. We have been working with them to produce a mapping application so that you can imagine all the languages, all the different aboriginal languages across Australia and how those overlap and their relationship on a big map. So we have been using a nice piece of software called     all open source on the open sector. People can use it with one another. Thus far the way we've been doing that is, again this goes back to the developer community giving them a list serve, giving them some tags to be able to talk about on whether that's Google plus, twitter or face book and then encouraging face to face. So we do have a really big advantage i that we are on a campus in the Uni of Melbourne. We are not distributed. So for us the technology tools - list ser, the twitter, all of that is actually a function of getting people together face to face because again it's hierarchy right. You get open, I've got to get trust and you're not usually going to get trust by someone tweeting one or another. So usually the fastest way to get trust is to have a face to face conversation and then all of a sudden the tools start to enable this collaboration. But we've got to build trust and i'm not saying you can't do trustified tools and e-mails or something or maybe Skye or whatever. But for me the fastest way we have always been able to achieve that is by face to face. Get the people together, get the linguist talking with other art historians. They all of a sudden are willing to e-mail each other and trust and it's not necessarily like the list serve right, they would rather e-mail me and then have a quite conversation on the side than put it out on the list serve. Researchers are inherently private people."
"So we are moving forwards from these collaborations that you are helping people with the tools that you're providing. What happens beyond those, when those are finished and people come to compete the work they've used these systems to build, are they quite happy and comfortable, are all their issued solved or does this new collaborative working style bring up more problems that you have to deal with when it comes to completing a piece of work?","Well, that's interesting. I don't know if we've gone that far yet. I think over the next eighteen months I'll be able to answer that question. What we're trying is really new. I mean most IT departments in universities are very very comfortable with help desks now and to propose that instead you are going to you this hippie free wheeling mechanism to do self supporting networks, it feels more like alcoholics anonymous than it feels like an official enterprise IT support department and yet I'm open for other discussions. Although saying that, what i do find interesting is that the open technology allows us to carry that on. One of the cool things is that by utilising the cloud and by utilising open stac, means that when a researcher comes along and uses a tool, at least that tool is still there. So there is a chance for further collaborations to occur beyond the life of the one person using it. In the old days it would have been - I've uploaded the tool, i have a ton of mail on my desk top my laptop either gets tossed or out the window. So we've then lost that persons project, their tool and most importantly we've lost the persons knowledge. I can't say the persons knowledge, they've moved on and that's the whole goal. But if we can save their tool and their data and get them to sign off on something at the end of their time here with us saying - i don't mind if you keep this data and this tool. That's a lot easier than us going and saying - can i have the stuff off your laptop. If it's already sitting in out network, secure and controlled but then we later go along and say, hey we've got this tool and another post graduate wants to use your tool that you built or the modifications then we're hoping that's the outcome. But again, ask me in eighteen months and I'll have a better idea."
"So do you think your focus for the next eighteen months will be trying to communicate to people how they can do these things differently and how they can get them, it sounds like you're saying - these tools are there and the open source stuff is there and you can make them available but it's changing the way people have worked in the past. You're having to change the structure of the help desk and so on, so is that going to be quite a challenge?","To tell you the truth I'm fairly optimistic about it. Just because i have built ambassador champion programmes before so i know what it means to have to get your ambassadors and champions and incentivize them, how to deal with the fact that when you loose them, how to role out new ones and all the rest of it. Community building i am pretty comfortable with. What will be really interesting is how well we can do with, the best part is Post Graduates are absolutely the best group of people you can have for ambassadors and champions - incredibly smart, not a lot of money so motivating them isn't incredibly hard, really altruistic. Most post graduates inertly care about and are open right and into doing things new. They're not like old professors and there's a lot of them. In the university of Melbourne there's twenty five thousand of them who have taught and researched there so i think we have a really large pool of people and basically for some pizza money and maybe sending them to a conference every now and again. I've got myself, for the cost of one salary member, i reckon i could have twenty five post graduate champions each representing the different areas for the same cost. It's maybe me playing a little bit fast and loose but why not utilise volunteer organisational structures where this is borrowed from. Me understanding the national   society and they way to do community building with the open knowledge foundation. Those skills all come together and we are utilising just a different structure than the help desk. We are utilising the community structure and it's a valid structure. It really does work and most importantly if you don't believe me go and look in any of thee big open source communities. They scale to potentially millions. So in theory it should be easy."
"So let's say you're going to solve that problem and everyone will be happy. What else then in the eighteen months or longer term, what's coming up for you that's a big issue. What will you need to solve later on or what will stop you doing the things you had hoped to achieve or what is coming up that will make things better for your work?","The main dilemma, is my worry - i think we're in a place of, there's the typical model of storming, forming, norming and over the past ten years i think we've been in the state of storming. There have been all these tools created for researchers to do different things but now we're starting to have the forming stage where finally people are starting to centre around certain very specific tools and it's tools like map lab and R stat and svss and stata and excel obviously. But there are starting to become some coalescence inside of these. Now what i find really interesting, is that the cats software we're using is going to become really core research software that people use. My question is will that be, and I'm back and forth on that a lot, like i said, what i care about is not that the tools open. I care that it has the largest possibility to have the largest community group because i can't support that tool myself. I can't have a help desk. I need that community whether that be the university of Melbourne community or even better a world wide community to say - we all support R stat as a statistical programming tool to be able to do all of our graphs inside of our research papers. My worry with that is that, R stat is great because it is a world wide community where as something like map lab costs a lot of money to do. So it's very privileged and university of Melbourne is the number one research uni in Australia and obviously can afford that and it needs a lot of money to do those things. We have a very large budget for buying research tools but i don't know that that's the best thing for research as a whole and Australia know this. The number of Chinese universities coming on line and even coming into the top one hundred universities. Even Africa's going up. Those groups could disruptabley innovate the whole thing and switch the thing around because they will be using a different tool and they will be over here. So i really believe it's important that we have to figure out a way to keep people in open tools and again, it's not because it's open it's because my researchers will have the best opportunities to find people to trust and collaborate with around the world because again, research is niche. It's really difficult to find someone who does know the Latin for this period and this region. There are only going to be two or three other people on the planet legitimately and if that persons using R Stat and the other persons using Map Lab they won't work with one another. They might have a conversation but the moment they have a tool they can work with one another, they are solving a problem with one another and that's what brings people together and that's what builds trust. It needs to be a shared tool and so some disciplines might decide that mathmatica is the tool that all mathematicians need to use and fair enough. As long as that's defacto."
"I want to bring something out of what you just said there. Explaining how you want to focus on tools out there and how having those tools openly available for the bigger community and you also mentioned that people will obviously publish their research when they are finished. So publication of research in itself is a tool, for communicating information. So what do you think about that tool in particular is that something that you can see as being a way of getting people to collaborate and be open with each other?","I think that's the most important tool of all. Basically the process of writing things with one another is essential and so word is crap for that. Anyone who has ever passed around revisions and I'm talking pure features whether it's open or closed. But the problem with word is that it's legitimately a bad technology for collaborating because passing reviews around means they are all out of sync and somebodies got to bring them back together. I really love google docs. If i said a preference right now, i would say google docs. For the most part at least it's free to use so there's not a barrier there, people can collaborate. But again the problem with Google docs is that it can lead to imbed the science and the data inside of it. You can do it to some degree and this is the point - once you start to collaborate and write a document with one another that's one thing. It's another thing once you start to do experiments and you need to pull the experiments inside of the research to do that. You have your experiment there and them most importantly once your experiments inside of that, what do you do? You then go out to your peer review and you get critiques about why everything is wrong. So then you're in a place again, just like the word document with reviews and it's oh shit we have to change all the graphs in this paper so that they line up with all the formulas along with all the tables and actually google docs. starts to fail there as well and then you move onto the next step. This is what i find really interesting is again back to the developer community, the developers are the ones who are dealing in this ultra collaborative space. They've invented tools like Latex and Mark Down and that's what i would see as the future as they are being able to write something and collaborate on it all at the same time like google docs. and then have peer review come in to it. Look at the data, change it. allow errors and ultimate revisions and then have versions all the way back. From inception of one author, to six authors writing it together to the editorials looking at it, to peer review giving comments back to it, to re-editing it. Thats' the whole chain that needs to be there. Not that any one's going to look at it but it should be there."
"So what happens at the end, does anyone look at it? You collaborate, you create this object, this artifact that has all your story, your back story as well. People can if they want to, search it and find out what you've done but then what do you do with it?","You publish it."
"Where does that happen?","On the web. It's already out there. I think publish is a bad word. We need a new word that shouldn't be publish, it should be... In all those versions they are all being published essentially but slowly released to different audiences and I'd even make the argument that, I've been doing this with a report recently, my peer reviewers are actually my target audience. They are the people i want to read the paper. So i will pretend in a way, that i am giving them exclusive access as you as an expert need to read this. I'm not doing it I'm actually hand delivering it. My editorial process is handing it to the main people i want to read the thing. The publication process where i hand it out and give it to the world it's kind of a long tail argument where i don't really care because my beta reviewers, my peer reviewers were actually the group that i wanted to read this thing. The rest of the world, i don't really care. It's the group of people that participated in that. So it's non consequential whether or not it does need to be opened up. It does need to be opened up because I'm invited to go and speak at conferences afterwards because people find that on the web and that's great for me because it brings up the next research. It's not publish, it's ..."
"So you have an advantage gained fro the information being opening that other people find it and ask you to come and talk. So in the same where you were describing how you help people collaborate at your university. Do you find the same benefits for yourself?",""Absolutely."
"Do you get more collaborations?","I eat my own dog food on this stuff. That's the nice thing about advocating this, is it's valuable to write research type stuff papers and there's a lot to be said for the scholarly method. How you put things through peer review. There's value in having things published and hyping things up more. I don't really know, I've never really published in nature and what happens when you have one hundred thousand people ask you a question because you have invented an idea. I have no idea about that. But what i do know, as a minor researcher in my own field is that it's a lot more advantageous for me to be out there than in some little shitty journal that i think people don't care about. The nice bit, again going back to the post graduates, that's what the post graduates are - post graduates are early career researchers. That are learning to do it that way and the whole point is that these post graduate researchers aren't going to be an Einstein or a Dawkins. It's just not going to happen. They're going to be minor researchers their entire life and they are going to have to fight and struggle to get research publications and frankly having a blog and pushing your ideas out there and doing revisions openly and utilising these tool chains. That gives you what is seen as being busy in the space, which builds up trust which gives you the next research grant. So we suffer in academia extremely about fame. Secretly, and they won't tell you this, most post graduates, and they should have this dream, in the same way that the entrepreneur thinks that they are going to be the next Bill Gates or the next Zuckerburg. Most researchers think - I'm secretly going to be the next Einstein. You're not, statistically you're not. You know this and you should know better than most because you actually have the mathematical skills but that's the point. It's actually about a better way of working if you want to get more money and do what you want to do. Working in the open makes you seem valuable to the community because you seem busy in the open."
