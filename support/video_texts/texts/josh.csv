"Who are you and what do you do","My name is Joshua Bowsher and I'm doing a PhD in Critical Theory at Nottingham University and my work focuses on a critique of transitional justice."
"I have described my work in open scholarship and I'm hoping to get a bit of discussion from you to about how you use information and access information and the problems that arise when you do so or if there's no problem then great. Also if you create or publish, then a bit of feedback from that perspective would be good. So to start with could you describe in your daily work, what sorts of things you tend to do when you realise that you need to know something that you don't know. Where do you look for this, what do you do at that point?","I probably have a tendency to do the same in terms of finding books and looking at philosophies which can in general help me but there is another part of my research which is about trying to map the field of transitional justice and that entails trying to get a hold of as much on line journal articles as possible because that's where people are releasing new stuff that is cool and is crucial to my research to make sure that it stays as correct as possible."
"So i imagine that you both look on-line for journals and stuff, is that common to both of you? Do you go to a library or where for you have access?","I know that although I'm a first year I've managed to map which journals i can go to - because they are diplomatic, have a good critique and which ones i can look at because the people are doing interesting things outside of the field. I guess i can sort of decide which ones to go to,but i've also got a subscription so i tend to look through things with key words which is helpful."
"So you have journals that you are interested in that you go to. What has brought those ones to your attention in the first place?","I think that's where the mark up thing is quite useful because it can bring attention to things that you wouldn't see in your expert field i guess. Although,sometimes i do think that google scholar can be quite, it might be something to do with the way their search engines are constructed but it tends to be quite narrow sometimes in what it actually brings up. I remember searching for something and it said it had 25 copies of the same thing which wasn't particularly useful."
"So you're saying search internal databases and so what would be the alternative if you weren't looking at google?",""project muse is another one. But i do ty to find, i don't know if whether it's because while I'm in the centre of critical theory,actually a lot of articles i need to find, if i was looking through something like Taylor & Francis, i would put my log in details and find that i would have no access to it which is very frustrating. It happens quite a lot to me, although it shouldn't because there is a human rights law department here which seems to me that there are quite a lot of articles here that don't have access to."
"OK, It seems clear then that you have both said that there are journals that you have access to, and you trust those journals to give you valid information but at the same time there are other journals that you don't have access to, but for some reason you have a desire to read them. Maybe you feel there is something in there that you should be reading?. So is there a difference in those journals, what is it that makes one of them seem as if it is something that you should reference compared to another journal where you might feel less inclined? Is there any quality that makes you think that one is better than the other?","I find and you'll probably find this too, that the academy for Transitional Justice is interlinked to the institution Transitionalof Justice, so it's really about trying to find articles in journals that are used in the industry so that they are not ones that are critiquing the industry, they are coming from that field or have influence's and circulate and produce affects i guess so that's really the main criteria that i try and find my articles"
"If you don't have access to a particular article, because presumbably the community of your university haven't paid the fee or so on. It sounds like that doesn't mean that you think that it's not therefore valuable, you still do want access? How would you get access to it?","So the first legitimate thing i try to do is get an inter library loan on the article which is frustrating because that in itself costs Â£1 for every article that you loan also because of the way it's done with the British Library, so that you down load it and i tend not to try and get it there because that's not so useful. If there's a bizarre mess up with the computers,and you only have limited access to it, OK i did it i had a couple of articles that i really needed to get hold of before Christmas and i basically ran out of time to use them because of the weird gate keeping they do on those things and it's really frustrating to try and get in contact with someone who can sort those things out for you as it was a couple more days before i could get access to them again. So that's the first thing i do. The second thing is - there is a repository called ARC.com which is an open access peer to peer sharing network for academics basically. So you can either search there in the repository and see what's there or you can make a request for something and if someones got it you can upload it. Those are the two things i try and do."
"The times that you do try and access these materials that you do think are important to your research - so you've tried to access it and you haven't been able to, do you feel that something has failed you in this process or do you feel that you have seen reasonable denials to your requests?","yes, what you want as a researcher is to have people read your research. It seems counter intuitive to create that. You need to know if they are. I'm resentful of it in a not very radical  way as at an institutional level i think that universities should have access to everything. So i find it frustrating when i can't because there just seems to be a pre-requisite on doing good research. I think that's a really interesting point - the lack of clarity even in terms of the level between the library and the researcher. The lack of clarity between what we can and can't access and which is frustrating."
"Do you feel left out of that? Or do you feel the information isn't available or do you think someone at the university is making the decisions for you or do you think it's something beyond that?","I think we have no concept as to how these decisions are made"
"OK, So do you think it's within the structure of your university or do you think it's imposed?","Yes, i think it moves between those two poles"
"So we were just starting to move away from the idea of looking for information, you have both described as been desperate to get hold of for your work. When you do get that information you are happy and when you don't you use the tools that are available and other means and then you mentioned that you think these things come up because people are publishing for REF frame work or are needing a career progression so, have either of you published any material and when you published did you feel different given you have been on the other side? What thoughts went through your head when you shared your creative work?","I'm not published, i find the whole idea intimidating because it is intimidating and the peer review process which can be good. But it does very much feel like it's crossing a threshold to me and i guess it's quite an important threshold in terms of your career as an academic"
"So you strongly feel you got value from the peer review process even when you got negative","That for me is frustrating. It's not about the quality of your work but about not having a common language."
"So you mentioned that the idea of being published in intimidating and you described that sometimes the process of getting published can be a nightmare. Do you think that puts you or people off doing that in a public fashion. Would it comfort you if that process was done privately or were you exposed, did you feel the commentary on your work should be made available to other people or not?","It doesn't begin your career on the best foot. Your first public foray is written, which you can be effectively be viscerated by the feedback that you get. Also i think there is a sense where if it becomes a personal attach, airing your dirty laundry in public isn't necessarily a good thing. I think it demeans the whole academic process or has the potential to."
"So i want to describe an example and see what your take on it is. The field i work in is development, there are more open source there are a lot ways in which i can do my work publicly and one of the things I've realised, over time is that i'm very good at doing my work publicly and taking those criticisms, simply due to experience so by default everything we do is visible from the start and that means you have some awful stuff from the start and things you created years ago and look back on and you can see yourself how bad you were at the time as it's visible and so we get used to that and from that certain communities have grown up where you  can go to a web site and you can ask questions and people give you feedback on those questions and the kinds of things you're describing where they give you feedback which is really just an attack, you could say  - well that's ust a stupid question or rather than answer your question they give you their rebuttal and their preferred answer which doesn't answer your question. Those things become quite well handled because it's public. As long as the majority of the community are of the same opinion, that it's better to be constructive, then the +1 system is basically so that people can't come at you in less useful ways get discounted. Do you think the idea od making it more public would help or hinder the process?","Yes, you'd have to know the particulars. I'm into the idea of publishing things from the start so that you have a continuing work in progress because it think there is a lot of pressure to produce things that are a finished product. The great thing about technology is that it has the potential to open up the academic community and to be able to put less pressure on a finished product all of the time really encourages that sense of a communal effort that i would aspire to in my academic career"
"So you mentioned that you have written a blog post, that gives you somewhere to work in an informal space and that you get commentary. So you guys have written a piece of work that you have access to and think is useful or not useful, one way or the other. Are there particular aspects of that work that in your community would be defined as formal or informal? With a blog would you automatically assume that it's not serious work or would it be serious and would your comments in that forum be different if you were asked to review the work in a different forum?","I think my comments would be more thorough in a blog. I think the serious or not serious one would be unhelpful. The difference between a blog and a journal article for me would be the sense in which someone, unless you wanted to write the longest blog in the world, you can't fully explain your ideas. It's the opportunity to present questions that you are still struggling with and for people to engage with those. Actually because it's informal I'd actually be more thorough in my enquiries."
"Given that say, Eva could be doing that in a public space on your blog, pseudo public in your group and you can provide feedback. If you are somewhere and engaging with that work at an early stage and you're   the idea of finality to a piece of research, For both of you, what do you think would answer that question, what makes that work final, who would be involved? Let's say you'd published, would you feel comfortable say referencing a link to Eva's blog, would you feel comfortable knowing someone had done that or would you prefer that Eva had it in a journal?","I think the question about finality is very difficult because the thing about blogs is that as much as people write some really good stuff in them, and it's an opportunity to talk, i think you do need a peer review system of some kind in order to guarantee academic rigour and to me i guess the question about finality would be about going through that process in which something is received. It would require that academic rigour. So in a sense what you're doing with blogs i guess is making more public perhaps the private chats and conversations which you would have with researchers anyway. Which i think is a useful thing to do."
"If academic rigour is illustrated by something like peer review which you don't get on a blog, what is about peer review or any other public place or location that makes you believe that that rigour has been achieved?","I don't think there is ever a perfect way of measuring rigour but i guess it is a personal thing and the more that you know your field and the more work that you know, a journal publishes then you get a sense for the work that they produce and the ways in which you can see rigours process must have taken place here because of the quality of the work is always good."
"Can you give me some idea of what do you think over your recent careers/studies what things have changed a lot or what do you think will change in the future about how you access information and are those things you think you will be involved in or things that you think will happen to you?","I guess critical theory is moving more towards open access especially big books. So one of our colleagues Colin Wright has just released a book in open access and also a few other lecturers which is actually i think a change in the last couple of years. But it is a difficult thing in terms of how that will affect me. I think it will be something i can do in a few years time but just in terms of having to jump through hoops for my career, i have to do journals, peer reviewed, pay for access stuff, books released through various standard publishers. I think. I do want to do open access but i know that i can't because i know i won't do anything"
"I feel from what I'm trying to learn, that there is a lack of clarity where this push is coming from that I'm trying to discover?","I think the quantifying thing is important. It becomes an excuse to be able to sneak in other things you are less confident in. I think it's really desensitive, lots of different forces moving in lots of different directions. It's not even explicit, it's almost a set of connections that make things happen in a certain way."
