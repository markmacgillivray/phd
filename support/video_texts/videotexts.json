Obviously it's a new job so it's still being defined but mainly it means that I'll have responsibility for defining the approach which Jisc takes to doing innovation. So my job is mainly process based. We're going to be using an approach to innovation that we've been piloting for the past year called Co-design and that's now been in used for all Jisc projects. It's my job to scale it up and to make sure the Jisc projects can work with them and all new projects come from that process. Obviously I'll oversee the projects that come out of that, the innovation projects that come out of that process. So it is a process based job now.",

            "id": "So the reason Jisc is interested in Co-design is because of the Wilson review. So in 2010 amid the financial crisis the government had a look at all the various organizations that were funded by the government. Jisc was reviewed by Wilson. That's why it's called the Wilson review and he had a number of things to say about all aspects of Jisc but innovation he had a few particular things to say about, one - that we did too many things, two - that they didn't always have the impact they should have because we were probably doing too many things and three - the process by which some of those things were agreed and started was often opaque. So Co-design as an approach innovation was a response to that to try and address some of those concerns. It does that by ensuring that key stake holders for the sector, the people who are going to use the things that innovation produces are involved in the process right from the very start and right throughout. So i don't mean that they are just consulted or they are used as a steering group. They are actually the people who we work with in a collaborative way to define what we are going to do, how are we going to do it and if we do it what success looks like for them. So last year we piloted that and the pilot was successful enough for us to scale it up. So that's the organizational reason. For me, what's led to that is, I've worked here in Jisc for about six or seven years now and throughout that time I've been involved in project in a number of different areas. I don't really have any expertise in a library background. I don't really have expertise in these. I can understand the technical stuff but I'm not technical. So i started off with repositories. I did activity data, open data, resource discovery. Quite a lot of library stuff and quite a lot of developer community stuff and a few bits around different types of innovation processes and throughout that, the common thread was, that i was interested in, were processes that define how we engage the creative people in higher education and how we engage them, how we ensure that all their creativity benefited as many people as possible. So i got more and more interested in the processes rather than the actually subjects where as my colleagues are more interested in the subject. So there research data programme manager they research data or the might be really interested in open data. I ended up being more and more interested in the processes and that's what i love focussing on and so when the Jisc leadership decided they wanted someone to look at processes, look at this new co-design approach and implement it, it was fortunate for me that i happened to have some spare time. Having expressed interest in this area that they asked me to look at and so i was able to take the outline of this process they defined, design the process and implement it. It has been a slow process over a number of years, moving away from expressing an interest in the sole object of what Jisc does and more about how Jisc does it. That's personally how Co-design came about for me.",

            "type": "answer", 
            "id": "Co-design is still very much a rough thing. It's not polished yet, it might not ever be polished. Polished is the enemy of good process because it ridgefies it and rigid hierarchies in many studies have shown to be counter-productive for innovation. So at the moment it's rough and we're developing it and polishing it but stake holders are one of the things that we have put more thought into because it's at the heart of it. As far as i see it there are three levels of engagement for stakeholders. The top is the kind of strategist level. Those are the people who are almost a kin to the organization who do say - this is what we want done, these are our needs and this is what we want done to address our needs. If you are going to successfully address these needs, this is what you need to do. So essentially they give you a strategic direction a strategic imperative for setting off in a direction. The co-designers at that level you would expect to be people like directors of IT, people like senior librarians, people like heads of E-learning, people like planners, finance directors, registrars. Essentially the people who organize in the institution, the college, the university etc who would be ultimately the people who would be signing off on the adoption of any product that was produced by innovation. They would make a decision whether to buy it. So they are the ultimate customer. They represent the people who if we're going to produce something, it has to meet their needs to be successful. So they operate at the strategist level. The next level down is the designer level. So once the strategist has identified a problem or an area of investigation or opportunity or idea. The experts from higher education institution s, from commercial organizations, from really anyone that's relevant. Jisc would convene them to work out how to go about addressing that opportunity or that problem and that would be the design stage and that could be broad array of people could be engaged in that area of design. From your expert developers through to your practitioners through to the senior managers who could again be involved in that level, people outside of the sectors such as commercial people could be involved, consultants such as Cottage Labs, people like that would be relevant there, people from government. You could imagine a vast different array. The point of that is that is supposed to be flexible diverse cause study after study shows that for innovation to work, diversity is the key ingredient to making innovation successful. So those are there and at the base level after you have designed something, you have to do it. So you've got the developer's, the doers whatever you want to call them, the implementers. The people who would go away and deliver the design. That's how i view Co-design, kind of these three stages of engagement and people could be engaged to co-design a project at any one of those levels. In the pilot we generally call people at the strategy level the co-designees, but really we've engaged a broad array of people to help us design and deliver the project and it's probably not that new to Jisc. We have always engaged widely what's different now is the systematised and the strategy level, the top level where people are involved much earlier in the decision process that they were before making it much more transparent and open in terms of what we're doing and why we're doing it and who we're doing it for.",

But obviously transparency has an enormous amount of benefits for innovation in general i think. One of which is diversity. Transparency enables people to be aware of what's happening and to be aware of how they can get involved and how it fits with the things they're doing and that leads to greater serendipity, greater knowledge spill over between different projects, greater diversity of input which should lead to stronger ideas. It also should lead in theory to more work done in the margins. Obviously organizations like 3M show and in fact research in general shows that lots of interesting stuff happens in the margins. So where disciplines meet or the margins where technologies meet. IN 3M for example i read that they developed a glue that was so strong it could be used for sound dampening in air craft engines. You wouldn't think that glue could do something like that but it's because they have these intersections, these margins where they are able to do interesting things like that. I think transparency is one of the key things to help leave the opportunity open for those kind of interesting things to arise in the margins. Finally i think it's important for people, obviously Jisc works with public money or institutions money so it's important for them to know purely where their money is spent and why it's spent and how it's being done. I think that is important anyway because it's a general principal. I think there are a number of reasons - Wilson, innovation reasons and just plain good management reasons. I think transparency for all of those reasons.",

This is a site where people can put ideas, generally for small projects on the site. They do a video picture of their idea and a short description, people can vote on that idea and if successful they get funded. We have used that a couple of times now and one of the key arguments against doing Elevator, in the early days when we were said should we do it, people said people don't like sharing their ideas and i had some experience of that previously where we'd issued a call for funding and we'd tried to get, encourage people to be openly sharing ideas beforehand and only two people did. We got quite a few bits back but only two people shared them. Probably just coincidence but those two were two of the strongest bids. I don't know if you can draw any conclusions from this as it's a small number. But never the less it was interesting. But innovator, we just haven't experienced any problems. People are very happy to put their ideas on there, very happy to share them openly. These are small ideas and that may be the difference and often their not researched in a way they are innovation which you could say, innovations the step after research. Research happens to invent something and then innovation comes along to make use of that. Amongst students particularly, so the recent Elovation competition was aimed at students and they had no fear, no qualms what so ever about sharing their ideas publicly. But that does contradict with previous things where we've tried to encourage openness and it hasn't happened. Although the difference is, Elevator required openness where you share your ideas openly and people are fine with that. We encouraged it and made a requirement of it. It didn't happen so there was no incentive to do it there i guess other than for it suited your own personal way of working. Maybe it's not that common in academia. I don't want too make to many suppositions there as it's not an area i know a lot about. My experience is, certainly with Elevator, they are quite happy to share ideas generally.",

            "type": "answer", 
            "id": "Yes. In a few cases, again we've run the Elevator twice. We've had twenty six ideas submitted the first time, the second time thirty six.So they're not enormous amounts of ideas. They didn't get an enormous amount of traction. But certainly on both times we've allowed people to comment on ideas and interesting comments have been put on. Sometimes saying this will never work, sometimes have you seen someone has already done the idea, sometimes saying I'm interested and they'd like to be involved and sometimes people have contacted people. I know for example a commercial organisation contacted one of the students before they got funded because they were interested in their idea. So yes there have been some inside benefits in terms of  making contacts, networking and sometimes learning that there's other things going on. But not perhaps as much as there could be. One of the things I'd really like to see Elevator do in terms of something we've always intended from the start is move from a demand exercise which is essentially what it is at the moment we put an idea up there and we assess the demand for it in terms of votes, to some kind of team forming exercise. I think that's how it would work in an ideal world. Someone would put an idea up there, a team would form around the idea. So people who could help deliver certain things about the idea or work together or look for an opportunity to trial the idea or offer expertise or critical mentorship for the idea any kind of addition for it and then instead of the most popular idea getting funded, the strongest team ends up getting funded around the idea. So it's a more practical instance, the level of excitement about the idea, to gauge the level of excitement and the acceptability of the idea. People who are actually dedicating time and effort or saying they will give time and effort to an idea seems to be a stronger thing than a lot of people ust saying - Yes, I quite like that. So in an ideal world if we could make that work, i think it's quite complex to make it work but in an ideal word that's how I'd like to see it working and i think that could kind of get at some of the things, the reason behind the question of what are the other benefits to being open i think that's a really interesting prospect that I'd like to have time to explore.",

Have you any of your own ideas yet about, there's a lot of barriers to being able to form a team like that because the makeup of the way humans interact, like we may be at different universities, some of us are at organizations, some of us are commercial, some of us are in places like Jisc which has a different position to say the universities themselves and so on. Have you any ideas on how you might tackle those problems, of say three or four different people all from these different kinds of place, they all want to work on an idea but how would you help them do so? In terms of what you're thinking of, your personal interest in the idea of moving to the processes and of having this sort of Co- design and the later things going on. What do you feel are the issues that might be, like you said it might be hard to enable this, so what do you think is stopping it at the moment if anything?",

        {
            "type": "answer", 
            "id": "The main thing is two things, one - just a very practical issue of getting a website to do that elegantly isn't trivial. It's easy to do voting there is a drupal plugin. It's simple. Working out the mechanism to form a team is much more difficult than voting cause team formation is quite, start ups say the thing that you should always focus on you should start early and focus on the hiring of the team. Formation is one of the most important things and to expect that to coalesce magically around an idea is a bit fanciful. So i think it would need some kind of, in my experience that doesn't happen naturally. People saying - Yes, let's work together,  I've just never seen that happen before in a virtual way. I've seen it happen before in a physical way, face to face meetings. But never in a virtual way. So getting over those practical web problems initially is what I'm talking about  and then there's the issue of choice of ownership and things like that. So you've put your idea up there and then would you really ust want to have anyone available in the community to work with you on it. Probably you wouldn't want to leave it that open an idea. Here's my idea and anyone could work openly. There's a study done by musicals. I forget who it was done by and what the name of it was but they developed something called a Que something or other a Que ratio or something and what they did was they studied the success of the musicals and the make up pf the teams behind them and they found there's streets wide diversity between them. Teams who all knew each other and teams where no-one knew each other. It seemed like the sweet spot was teams that mostly knew each other but with some new people. Enough to bring in new ideas to challenge the status quo. So enough to have a successful way of working and understand each others way of working and just be successful as a team but that thirst of new ideas, challenges to break open assumptions or to try new ways of doing it. To bring in fresh new ideas and that's why i imagine you'd need on something like that, what you'd want is a team to come up with that idea and a team that's newly formed and for them to say what else do we need in terms of expertise or to be open to things they hadn't thought of or people they hadn't thought of getting involved. There is also another example of something like this where the website site like inocentive. Inocentive is an open innovation website where companies have problems and they say - we're having a problem with this chemical engineering issue and ask them to solve it. They frequently solve the problems that are up there but they frequently solve  i can't remember the exact figures but they are often solved by people in a different discipline who have seen the idea up there. So i think rather than just a complete team formation you'd want something like that probably because a complete team would be fanciful and wouldn't be ideal, a team of strangers. So i think to do it properly you'd need that kind of thought  and I'm thinking on my feet as I've not thought about it enough. I think that's what you'd need, it's one aspect of it. The second aspect of it and the more practical aspect of it is say for example you'd got a good team a team with a core of people who knew each other and all knew the idea but with some fresh new people coming in as part of the process. Then you'd have to tackle the other practical issues around how they work together and that's something we have quite a lot of experience in in Jisc. A lot of the work we do is with distributed people and distributed teams rather than co-located teams just as Jisc as an organization itself is  distributed and co-located. Most of my colleagues are elsewhere. I don't think that's uncommon now in academia. More and more teams are geographically distributed. I'm not sure it's completely optimal in a lot of ways. Certainly methodology like agile, assume and co-location.You see start ups again and start ups in innovative tech companies spend an enormous amount of time thinking about who sits where in the office and that sort of thing. I met one the other day where they change their seating arrangement every two months making sure that the right personalities are sitting with each other. So it shows co-location is incredibly important but we don't always have that luxury. So we have to find ways around that and using things like Google docs. depending on what you're doing but Google docs. Github, blogs, more corporate systems like sharepoint all that kind of thing is really important. Also finding methodologies that work is also important. So Agile works extremely well for technology projects but if you're a distributed team it's not really designed for you. Assume is co-location and meeting standard and all that kind of stuff. But you can still use the same principal in a distributed team, regular conversations, not planning in detail too far ahead, making yourself able to change direction and pivot as things happen and so i think taking all those principals and apply it to your team but you just have to be aware of that and plan slightly differently. That's even more difficult if say ninety percent of the team are located in one place and ten percent are located elsewhere. How do you stop that person becoming disconnected, marginalised? their opinions, feeling frustrated that nothing their doing is.  So there are all of those issued with team building which is why virtually going the other way is easier, it gets us somewhere. But in an ideal world, i think if we are, someone said to me just today that often in innovation people focus too much on ideas and less on execution and i worry that something like the Elevator is doing that. It is focused on ideas because there is a demand for ideas but if we really wanted to do this well we'd focus on execution. So how we form the team, who's in the team, how they work together and focusing in detail on that may well end up with better results. Initially putting all your focus on the ideas but obviously as i say it's not terribly straight forward to do that.",

I guess it's because to some extent i think the things that we're doing and if they are done well are worthwhile. They are worth doing. If Jisc can act as an agent that can help people produce things that do help universities and colleges do things better help improve the student experience that's something that's worth doing. It's  goal. It's interesting. I guess if i was trying to be less lofty I'd say it's because your competitive i think as well cause you want to make sure that what you do is good and you've got pride in what you do and you want to make sure the things you do are good. So you spend a lot of time thinking about how to do them better. I also think that I'm very fidgety from the video you'll have noticed, but in my mind I'm very fidgety i get restless very easily and then I'm never happy I'm never satisfied. I always want to improve things and when processes improve it seems to be an itch i can't scratch. When i see something and I've done something i think OK i could have done it this way, i could have done it that way i want to do it better next time. So there's always that kind of almost personal dissatisfaction that drives you on to do things. I think all of that would be the same even if i perhaps didn't believe in it as much as i do, but i think that plus the fact i do think that what Jisc does and especially the university of higher education sector does is worthwhile and important and is exciting. I think those two together make you want to try and do things better and improve things.",

            "id": "This is something that I'm permanently dissatisfied with. I have never found anything that made me happy. The one that I'm getting enough of what i need to read, there's always a real restlessness there - how can i get more things. I mean I've very little with patience, I'm very impatient with things. I don't tend to read modular scholar research because i don't tend to operate at that level of detail. That detail tends to be extraneous to me so i want to digest it a level above. But one of the things i am dissatisfied with is sharing, that's the most frustrating thing - how do we share effectively what we've learned? So generally i suppose my methods are three things. One is haphazard clicking. I would say the majority of what i do is haphazard clicking. I'll spend happily a couple of hours a day in work or out of work on my phone or whatever just clicking away and following things. Not like I've scheduled that time but it;s just what i do. I'll read something that will lead to something that will lead to something and that haphazard clicking now is generally quite a satisfying process. I don't, because of the level of detail I'm doing i don't tend to hit upon payables that often or if i do it tends to be books I'm paying for than other forms of research. I've just realised i don't  i don't know why. So that's haphazard clicking and that can be any source but it tends to rely on free data like wikipedia and blogs, magazines, places like the Orion Radar, Harvard Business Review, newspapers and that often leads you to something more detailed like books. So last year i started to read a lot more non-fiction. I read a lot about economics and innovation and statistics and predictions and complexities and things like that and that's all lead to stuff that interests me in a personal capacity and a work capacity. The third ones is social networks. I would say that's fairly massive. Most of the really genuinely new and interesting stuff that i hadn't followed for my own interest, that's the thing about the Google filter bubble is the social networks, there's where i get things that come out of the blue and surprise me from things like twitter and so on. But the most important thing is, and this is something that i read about again and again in books on innovation is talking, it's probably the least efficient but most effective method of finding out new things. So I'll start talking to someone in the office about something i read and half understood about statistics or something and then they'll tell me something else or a book they're reading and then I'll go off  and that's generally the most effective thing. I'll tell them about something I've read that i think is brilliant and they'll tell me it's rubbish for reasons i hadn't realised. Then that will send me off down another route. When i think about trying to systematise this better and trying to do this better that's often the bit i neglect. I often don;t think that     is inefficient it's haphazard. But i do think it's the single most effective thing, i remember reading about the economics of football and they were talking about how Britain is often tactically behind other nations in British football and that was because of our separation in both in terms of geographical separation from the European continent where the innovations are coming from. Places like Holland and Spain. Spain more recently, but Holland and Germany in the seventies and so on and it's only recently that we've started to catch up. It's people talking and sharing of information that is really key to making sure that people advance and you see geographical corporations like Silicon Valley based on the fact of sharing knowledge so some innovation books call it knowledge pull over. The ability to make sure that you're in the conversation that you are networking with people who have these ideas and doing things differently to make it challenging and they said the in this book about football is you often see the most successful managers are more networked. They talked specifically about Sir Alex Ferguson and said he spends an enormous amount of time on the phone or talking to other managers in what could seem like, if you were auditing it from the outside, casual chatter but that was an essential way he found out about all sorts of other stuff that was going around you know players that were available, tactics, ideas all of that kind of stuff. As i get old from experience i realised how much more important that was. So from experience I've realised how important that was. I mean five years or ten years ago i would have said that we could do it on line better by book marking it or something like that. But now if i spend all of my day in meetings just talking to people then to some extent probably no work gets done, it's a day wasted. As long as it wasn't a frustrating conversation or going round in circles i would now envisage that to be an effective way to start sharing knowledge and learning stuff. It's a rambling answer",

If there's a bizarre mess up with the computers,and you only have limited access to it, OK i did it i had a couple of articles that i really needed to get hold of before Christmas and i basically ran out of time to use them because of the weird gate keeping they do on those things and it's really frustrating to try and get in contact with someone who can sort those things out for you as it was a couple more days before i could get access to them again. So that's the first thing i do. The second thing is - there is a repository called ARC.com which is an open access peer to peer sharing network for academics basically.

The other thing i might do actually is e-mail the author. So that if it's something that i really want to read, i have done that before, i have e-mailed somebody and they have e-mailed me recently to get something. So obviously it only works if you have some pre existing thing. But it is a nice thing to do as well i think, as people like it when you're interested in their things. I think for me, it's not the same as other forms of copy write - retaining creative control over a film, where the money is going into the film. Where as with the journal articles i don't get the sense, it's almost an anti-benefit to the author. The only reason they do it is because of the research excellence framework, you need a number. You need a certain number of things in journals, you need a certain number of things to get a job. It is very difficult to get a job as an early career researcher. So you are forced to do these things which seem to be oppositional to what you want to do. Also the boundaries are always shifting. You don't know. Every thing's got politics to it and you don't know, suddenly i can't access these journals does that mean that somewhere else someone looked to.

I didn't expect it but i got amazing feedback and it was like being part of a knowledge community. It was really helpful and really great and i thought, this is how it should be. This is what peer review should be about. The when it got published it was difficult for people to get access to and it was quite nice because i did get a couple of e-mails from people saying could you e-mail me the article but officially the way i should have done it was, you get a link fro the publisher saying you get 23 downloads and to share the link with your friends. You were supposed to spread this link with your friends so they could read your article and i thought that's cool Then my first horrible thought was -  OK that will look good for me in terms of stats and hits to link to my article and then i thought - that's hideous. So I've not shared it with anyone but if someone e-mails me asking for a copy of the article I'll share it with them. Well it depends, I've had some horrible ones too. I think it's one of these things that because of RAG and because of undue pressure on it when what it's fundamentally about is supporting you as a researcher and giving you constructive feedback and I've had a few rejctions but i feel that the process has been almost an extension of my PhD of where I've developed my work. It's been really helpful exen though it's not nice to be rejected. Some of the feedback has been just as helpful and honed my work in a particular way.

The field i work in is development, there are more open source there are a lot ways in which i can do my work publicly and one of the things I've realised, over time is that i'm very good at doing my work publicly and taking those criticisms, simply due to experience so by default everything we do is visible from the start and that means you have some awful stuff from the start and things you created years ago and look back on and you can see yourself how bad you were at the time as it's visible and so we get used to that and from that certain communities have grown up where you  can go to a web site and you can ask questions and people give you feedback on those questions and the kinds of things you're describing where they give you feedback which is really just an attack, you could say  - well that's ust a stupid question or rather than answer your question they give you their rebuttal and their preferred answer which doesn't answer your question. Those things become quite well handled because it's public. As long as the majority of the community are of the same opinion, that it's better to be constructive, then the +1 system is basically so that people can't come at you in less useful ways get discounted.

It doesn't necessarily guarantee it, especially if it's from a different disciplinary perspective. They might be just working through ideas that have happened elsewhere at different points. I think it's to do with what you bring to it as well and how you interpret things. What i see as really useful, is that you know the key things in your field, the key developments and good peer review should be about that you have filled in those gaps and you have got all the context and that you're not trying to claim something that's novel that's been done. It should be about producing knowledge, that's what it's about. It's not about publishing for the sake of it and if you're rehashing something that's been said elsewhere but trying to give it a new label then that isn't about producing knowledge that's just publishing for the sake of publishing.

She's been involved with work to do with open access models for humanities that are like the +1 model and things like that.

I don't know if the motivations are geared towards the genuine production of knowledge. On the other hand, our discipline is quite political and i know that Colin's work, he was keen to have it downloaded for free on open access because of political commitments and i think that within our discipline there is that desire to try and make things freely available.

Even in terms of publishers there's hierarchy of which publishers are the best to publish in. A lot of academics don't know about and those that do know these things have generally got an insight. I think it's partly tradition and partly this push to be able to qualify for things, to quantify knowledge. If it's peer reviewed then that can be quantified on a good piece of work. I think it's those two and that it's a cultural thing. I think it's to do with the new globalisation of the university - thought I'd get that in there. But it is to do with being able to say OK, it is being used in a very specific way to say we are going to put this person on a personal teaching contract, Not in our department i would say, but I've heard of other institutions, being told that they are going to be put on teaching contracts because you have not met this number of publications.

I guess for me other than the broad sweeping arguments of, you can hear my accent I'm American so even though i have British citizenship and I'm applying for Australian citizenship. I've always been very sensitive to the fact that in spending tax payer money whether it be in the US, UK or Australia, that's what you're doing right and it's scary to look at someone who pays taxes and say - i'm spending your money and yet i don't have the same accent as you or the same ideals of user patriotism as you. That type of thing, so that's always mattered to me, to be defending that at a very real level. Now that's nice as a broad sweeping argument, but the moment you get into the long tailed discussion of kind of opening up something like bio-medical data or something and you get into a conversation about anonomizing it or de-identifying it, there's a very long tailed discussion that has to occur in each one of the different disciplines and all the rest of it. For better or worse i feel that it does basically improve the rate and the speed of which scholarship occurs. If you can get the problems out of the way, if we can come up with a good de-identification or way of anonymizing the data, or tools or whatever, in a way that it can be made open then i actually feel that what that will do for researchers is that it will get them more research funding and save them time. So it comes down to a very real thing where researchers actually can say - because i opened up my data and put in that extra effort to anonymize it and now it's out there in the open, then said researcher across the country, the globe and I've seen this, I've friends, i'm much more closer to. People talk about international like they know what it it is, I've seen it. I've got a meta researcher in Oxford who's worked with a researcher in Melbourne who I've then connected to a researcher, you know who's in Sandeago and that's very real. It's a very small group but then they do really amazing and cool things. Most of the time it's the data, the tools, the method or the publication that's enabled them to participate and do things with that. So it isn't even about open. The word i use more than anything else is collaborative. Open enables collaboration.  Open is not a means to an end, collaboration is where we want to get researchers doing things and that involves all the problems of human psychology, of trust, of relationships and all the rest of it. But open is at least one pillar inside it being able to accelerate that place where we can collaborate that.",

But the cool thing about it is again isn't the technology, it's the fact that it allows us to openly share things. One of my favourite examples is what i call the ball of clay example, which is, normally people have got Tab software, 3-D software and the problem with that is that you're doing it by yourself. It's like you standing over a ball of clay and doing the whole thing together so it's cut scene and now imagine ghost and there's a ball of clay between the two of us. Being able to both put our hands on that and form it together, that's the amazing possibility of collaboration. So it took an open piece of technology to enable that, researcher doesn't even know it's called open stac, they ust know that they now have this share of a piece of software that they're using sitting on the cloud and it enables them to be both looking at this thing with one another and it's interesting as open stac is now open, but the software we're using isn't necessarily open. But it's enough open that it's enabled the collaboration in the community and that's what's exciting, because once you have two people using that, all of a sudden the ability to scale out and bring more and more people into the all of clay problem and that's what's cool. Unlike the physical enironment wher you can only maybe fit six hands on the ball of clay, in the digital space there is an upward number.",

            "id": "It literally is the opportunity to collaborate. The whole point is that researchers feel alone and isolated in using their tools. I mean we did a tool audit of researchers at the Uni of Melbourne and we think, it's a very broad structure, back of a napkin time numbers right. Each department, five or six research tools, N number of departments times N number of international collaborations, subdivided by some core tools that people use. So we think it's like two hundred to five hundred tools sit on any given research canvas. Which isn't all that shocking really, i think that's pretty normal. But the point of that is that you do feel really alone in these tools. So a linguist doing tree maps will have these really niche bits of software which are really cool and powerful for them but they are actually quite old and one of the most difficult things is that they eventually get the thing up and working but then you're like well how do i do this? So the ability to turn around and ask somebody how to do that is really powerful and the other interesting side to that coin is, this is something I'm very passionate about, is you're never going to provide a help desk for that. That's one of the problems. IT, the traditional solution has been - here is a tool, let's provide a help desk. Hi i'm the researcher, I'm working on Indonesian languages from the sixth period such and such and i want to produce a tree diagram which works with this language and bridges to this language. That's impossible, We are never going to get a help desk for that type of thing. The only solution in this is community and collaboration, ergo back to my original point. If you don't have open, that's the other point, it enables more open. The diconomy of us buying a bunch of software to make it open. So we buy a site license that now allows us to use a piece of software so that it feels open to everybody on the campus. But the sad part is that that is kind of limiting because what we actually want to do is to make sure that our researcher working with the African researcher, with the Indian researcher or the Chinese researcher also has access to that tool and all of a sudden we are getting problems when in fact, they would much rather Skye their colleagues in Indian than necessarily turn around and ask someone round the corner?",

For example the linguist. We have been working with them to produce a mapping application so that you can imagine all the languages, all the different aboriginal languages across Australia and how those overlap and their relationship on a big map. So we have been using a nice piece of software called     all open source on the open sector. People can use it with one another. Thus far the way we've been doing that is, again this goes back to the developer community giving them a list serve, giving them some tags to be able to talk about on whether that's Google plus, twitter or face book and then encouraging face to face. So we do have a really big advantage i that we are on a campus in the Uni of Melbourne. We are not distributed. So for us the technology tools - list ser, the twitter, all of that is actually a function of getting people together face to face because again it's hierarchy right. You get open, I've got to get trust and you're not usually going to get trust by someone tweeting one or another. So usually the fastest way to get trust is to have a face to face conversation and then all of a sudden the tools start to enable this collaboration. But we've got to build trust and i'm not saying you can't do trustified tools and e-mails or something or maybe Skye or whatever. But for me the fastest way we have always been able to achieve that is by face to face. Get the people together, get the linguist talking with other art historians. They all of a sudden are willing to e-mail each other and trust and it's not necessarily like the list serve right, they would rather e-mail me and then have a quite conversation on the side than put it out on the list serve.

I mean most IT departments in universities are very very comfortable with help desks now and to propose that instead you are going to you this hippie free wheeling mechanism to do self supporting networks, it feels more like alcoholics anonymous than it feels like an official enterprise IT support department and yet I'm open for other discussions. Although saying that, what i do find interesting is that the open technology allows us to carry that on. One of the cool things is that by utilising the cloud and by utilising open stac, means that when a researcher comes along and uses a tool, at least that tool is still there. So there is a chance for further collaborations to occur beyond the life of the one person using it. In the old days it would have been - I've uploaded the tool, i have a ton of mail on my desk top my laptop either gets tossed or out the window. So we've then lost that persons project, their tool and most importantly we've lost the persons knowledge. I can't say the persons knowledge, they've moved on and that's the whole goal. But if we can save their tool and their data and get them to sign off on something at the end of their time here with us saying - i don't mind if you keep this data and this tool. That's a lot easier than us going and saying - can i have the stuff off your laptop. If it's already sitting in out network, secure and controlled but then we later go along and say, hey we've got this tool and another post graduate wants to use your tool that you built or the modifications then we're hoping that's the outcome. But again, ask me in eighteen months and I'll have a better idea.",

Just because i have built ambassador champion programmes before so i know what it means to have to get your ambassadors and champions and incentivize them, how to deal with the fact that when you loose them, how to role out new ones and all the rest of it. Community building i am pretty comfortable with. What will be really interesting is how well we can do with, the best part is Post Graduates are absolutely the best group of people you can have for ambassadors and champions - incredibly smart, not a lot of money so motivating them isn't incredibly hard, really altruistic. Most post graduates inertly care about and are open right and into doing things new. They're not like old professors and there's a lot of them. In the university of Melbourne there's twenty five thousand of them who have taught and researched there so i think we have a really large pool of people and basically for some pizza money and maybe sending them to a conference every now and again. I've got myself, for the cost of one salary member, i reckon i could have twenty five post graduate champions each representing the different areas for the same cost. It's maybe me playing a little bit fast and loose but why not utilise volunteer organisational structures where this is borrowed from. Me understanding the national   society and they way to do community building with the open knowledge foundation. Those skills all come together and we are utilising just a different structure than the help desk. We are utilising the community structure and it's a valid structure. It really does work and most importantly if you don't believe me go and look in any of thee big open source communities. They scale to potentially millions. So in theory it should be easy.",

There have been all these tools created for researchers to do different things but now we're starting to have the forming stage where finally people are starting to centre around certain very specific tools and it's tools like map lab and R stat and svss and stata and excel obviously. But there are starting to become some coalescence inside of these. Now what i find really interesting, is that the cats software we're using is going to become really core research software that people use. My question is will that be, and I'm back and forth on that a lot, like i said, what i care about is not that the tools open. I care that it has the largest possibility to have the largest community group because i can't support that tool myself. I can't have a help desk. I need that community whether that be the university of Melbourne community or even better a world wide community to say - we all support R stat as a statistical programming tool to be able to do all of our graphs inside of our research papers. My worry with that is that, R stat is great because it is a world wide community where as something like map lab costs a lot of money to do. So it's very privileged and university of Melbourne is the number one research uni in Australia and obviously can afford that and it needs a lot of money to do those things. We have a very large budget for buying research tools but i don't know that that's the best thing for research as a whole and Australia know this. The number of Chinese universities coming on line and even coming into the top one hundred universities. Even Africa's going up. Those groups could disruptabley innovate the whole thing and switch the thing around because they will be using a different tool and they will be over here. So i really believe it's important that we have to figure out a way to keep people in open tools and again, it's not because it's open it's because my researchers will have the best opportunities to find people to trust and collaborate with around the world because again, research is niche. It's really difficult to find someone who does know the Latin for this period and this region. There are only going to be two or three other people on the planet legitimately and if that persons using R Stat and the other persons using Map Lab they won't work with one another. They might have a conversation but the moment they have a tool they can work with one another, they are solving a problem with one another and that's what brings people together and that's what builds trust. It needs to be a shared tool and so some disciplines might decide that mathmatica is the tool that all mathematicians need to use and fair enough. As long as that's defacto.",

Anyone who has ever passed around revisions and I'm talking pure features whether it's open or closed. But the problem with word is that it's legitimately a bad technology for collaborating because passing reviews around means they are all out of sync and somebodies got to bring them back together. I really love google docs. If i said a preference right now, i would say google docs. For the most part at least it's free to use so there's not a barrier there, people can collaborate. But again the problem with Google docs is that it can lead to imbed the science and the data inside of it. You can do it to some degree and this is the point - once you start to collaborate and write a document with one another that's one thing. It's another thing once you start to do experiments and you need to pull the experiments inside of the research to do that. You have your experiment there and them most importantly once your experiments inside of that, what do you do? You then go out to your peer review and you get critiques about why everything is wrong. So then you're in a place again, just like the word document with reviews and it's oh shit we have to change all the graphs in this paper so that they line up with all the formulas along with all the tables and actually google docs. starts to fail there as well and then you move onto the next step. This is what i find really interesting is again back to the developer community, the developers are the ones who are dealing in this ultra collaborative space. They've invented tools like Latex and Mark Down and that's what i would see as the future as they are being able to write something and collaborate on it all at the same time like google docs. and then have peer review come in to it. Look at the data, change it. allow errors and ultimate revisions and then have versions all the way back. From inception of one author, to six authors writing it together to the editorials looking at it, to peer review giving comments back to it, to re-editing it. Thats' the whole chain that needs to be there. Not that any one's going to look at it but it should be there.",

The publication process where i hand it out and give it to the world it's kind of a long tail argument where i don't really care because my beta reviewers, my peer reviewers were actually the group that i wanted to read this thing. The rest of the world, i don't really care. It's the group of people that participated in that. So it's non consequential whether or not it does need to be opened up. It does need to be opened up because I'm invited to go and speak at conferences afterwards because people find that on the web and that's great for me because it brings up the next research. It's not publish, it's ...",

That's the nice thing about advocating this, is it's valuable to write research type stuff papers and there's a lot to be said for the scholarly method. How you put things through peer review. There's value in having things published and hyping things up more. I don't really know, I've never really published in nature and what happens when you have one hundred thousand people ask you a question because you have invented an idea. I have no idea about that. But what i do know, as a minor researcher in my own field is that it's a lot more advantageous for me to be out there than in some little shitty journal that i think people don't care about. The nice bit, again going back to the post graduates, that's what the post graduates are - post graduates are early career researchers. That are learning to do it that way and the whole point is that these post graduate researchers aren't going to be an Einstein or a Dawkins. It's just not going to happen. They're going to be minor researchers their entire life and they are going to have to fight and struggle to get research publications and frankly having a blog and pushing your ideas out there and doing revisions openly and utilising these tool chains. That gives you what is seen as being busy in the space, which builds up trust which gives you the next research grant. So we suffer in academia extremely about fame. Secretly, and they won't tell you this, most post graduates, and they should have this dream, in the same way that the entrepreneur thinks that they are going to be the next Bill Gates or the next Zuckerburg. Most researchers think - I'm secretly going to be the next Einstein. You're not, statistically you're not. You know this and you should know better than most because you actually have the mathematical skills but that's the point. It's actually about a better way of working if you want to get more money and do what you want to do. Working in the open makes you seem valuable to the community because you seem busy in the open.",

Obviously it's a new job so it's still being defined but mainly it means that I'll have responsibility for defining the approach which Jisc takes to doing innovation. So my job is mainly process based. We're going to be using an approach to innovation that we've been piloting for the past year called Co-design and that's now been in used for all Jisc projects. It's my job to scale it up and to make sure the Jisc projects can work with them and all new projects come from that process. Obviously I'll oversee the projects that come out of that, the innovation projects that come out of that process. So it is a process based job now.",

            "answer": "So the reason Jisc is interested in Co-design is because of the Wilson review. So in 2010 amid the financial crisis the government had a look at all the various organizations that were funded by the government. Jisc was reviewed by Wilson. That's why it's called the Wilson review and he had a number of things to say about all aspects of Jisc but innovation he had a few particular things to say about, one - that we did too many things, two - that they didn't always have the impact they should have because we were probably doing too many things and three - the process by which some of those things were agreed and started was often opaque. So Co-design as an approach innovation was a response to that to try and address some of those concerns. It does that by ensuring that key stake holders for the sector, the people who are going to use the things that innovation produces are involved in the process right from the very start and right throughout. So i don't mean that they are just consulted or they are used as a steering group. They are actually the people who we work with in a collaborative way to define what we are going to do, how are we going to do it and if we do it what success looks like for them. So last year we piloted that and the pilot was successful enough for us to scale it up. So that's the organizational reason. For me, what's led to that is, I've worked here in Jisc for about six or seven years now and throughout that time I've been involved in project in a number of different areas. I don't really have any expertise in a library background. I don't really have expertise in these. I can understand the technical stuff but I'm not technical. So i started off with repositories. I did activity data, open data, resource discovery. Quite a lot of library stuff and quite a lot of developer community stuff and a few bits around different types of innovation processes and throughout that, the common thread was, that i was interested in, were processes that define how we engage the creative people in higher education and how we engage them, how we ensure that all their creativity benefited as many people as possible. So i got more and more interested in the processes rather than the actually subjects where as my colleagues are more interested in the subject. So there research data programme manager they research data or the might be really interested in open data. I ended up being more and more interested in the processes and that's what i love focussing on and so when the Jisc leadership decided they wanted someone to look at processes, look at this new co-design approach and implement it, it was fortunate for me that i happened to have some spare time. Having expressed interest in this area that they asked me to look at and so i was able to take the outline of this process they defined, design the process and implement it. It has been a slow process over a number of years, moving away from expressing an interest in the sole object of what Jisc does and more about how Jisc does it. That's personally how Co-design came about for me.",

            "answer": "Co-design is still very much a rough thing. It's not polished yet, it might not ever be polished. Polished is the enemy of good process because it ridgefies it and rigid hierarchies in many studies have shown to be counter-productive for innovation. So at the moment it's rough and we're developing it and polishing it but stake holders are one of the things that we have put more thought into because it's at the heart of it. As far as i see it there are three levels of engagement for stakeholders. The top is the kind of strategist level. Those are the people who are almost a kin to the organization who do say - this is what we want done, these are our needs and this is what we want done to address our needs. If you are going to successfully address these needs, this is what you need to do. So essentially they give you a strategic direction a strategic imperative for setting off in a direction. The co-designers at that level you would expect to be people like directors of IT, people like senior librarians, people like heads of E-learning, people like planners, finance directors, registrars. Essentially the people who organize in the institution, the college, the university etc who would be ultimately the people who would be signing off on the adoption of any product that was produced by innovation. They would make a decision whether to buy it. So they are the ultimate customer. They represent the people who if we're going to produce something, it has to meet their needs to be successful. So they operate at the strategist level. The next level down is the designer level. So once the strategist has identified a problem or an area of investigation or opportunity or idea. The experts from higher education institution s, from commercial organizations, from really anyone that's relevant. Jisc would convene them to work out how to go about addressing that opportunity or that problem and that would be the design stage and that could be broad array of people could be engaged in that area of design. From your expert developers through to your practitioners through to the senior managers who could again be involved in that level, people outside of the sectors such as commercial people could be involved, consultants such as Cottage Labs, people like that would be relevant there, people from government. You could imagine a vast different array. The point of that is that is supposed to be flexible diverse cause study after study shows that for innovation to work, diversity is the key ingredient to making innovation successful. So those are there and at the base level after you have designed something, you have to do it. So you've got the developer's, the doers whatever you want to call them, the implementers. The people who would go away and deliver the design. That's how i view Co-design, kind of these three stages of engagement and people could be engaged to co-design a project at any one of those levels. In the pilot we generally call people at the strategy level the co-designees, but really we've engaged a broad array of people to help us design and deliver the project and it's probably not that new to Jisc. We have always engaged widely what's different now is the systematised and the strategy level, the top level where people are involved much earlier in the decision process that they were before making it much more transparent and open in terms of what we're doing and why we're doing it and who we're doing it for.",

            "answer": "Well the Wilson review is one. The Wilson review did state that some Jisc processes were opaque and needed to be addressed and we did not meet customer needs. But obviously transparency has an enormous amount of benefits for innovation in general i think. One of which is diversity. Transparency enables people to be aware of what's happening and to be aware of how they can get involved and how it fits with the things they're doing and that leads to greater serendipity, greater knowledge spill over between different projects, greater diversity of input which should lead to stronger ideas. It also should lead in theory to more work done in the margins. Obviously organizations like 3M show and in fact research in general shows that lots of interesting stuff happens in the margins. So where disciplines meet or the margins where technologies meet. IN 3M for example i read that they developed a glue that was so strong it could be used for sound dampening in air craft engines. You wouldn't think that glue could do something like that but it's because they have these intersections, these margins where they are able to do interesting things like that. I think transparency is one of the key things to help leave the opportunity open for those kind of interesting things to arise in the margins. Finally i think it's important for people, obviously Jisc works with public money or institutions money so it's important for them to know purely where their money is spent and why it's spent and how it's being done.

            "answer": "It has. But often not as much as feared, i have found. One example is we developed a site called Jisc Elevator. This is a site where people can put ideas, generally for small projects on the site. They do a video picture of their idea and a short description, people can vote on that idea and if successful they get funded. We have used that a couple of times now and one of the key arguments against doing Elevator, in the early days when we were said should we do it, people said people don't like sharing their ideas and i had some experience of that previously where we'd issued a call for funding and we'd tried to get, encourage people to be openly sharing ideas beforehand and only two people did. We got quite a few bits back but only two people shared them. Probably just coincidence but those two were two of the strongest bids. I don't know if you can draw any conclusions from this as it's a small number. But never the less it was interesting. But innovator, we just haven't experienced any problems. People are very happy to put their ideas on there, very happy to share them openly. These are small ideas and that may be the difference and often their not researched in a way they are innovation which you could say, innovations the step after research. Research happens to invent something and then innovation comes along to make use of that. Amongst students particularly, so the recent Elovation competition was aimed at students and they had no fear, no qualms what so ever about sharing their ideas publicly. But that does contradict with previous things where we've tried to encourage openness and it hasn't happened. Although the difference is, Elevator required openness where you share your ideas openly and people are fine with that. We encouraged it and made a requirement of it. It didn't happen so there was no incentive to do it there i guess other than for it suited your own personal way of working. Maybe it's not that common in academia. I don't want too make to many suppositions there as it's not an area i know a lot about. My experience is, certainly with Elevator, they are quite happy to share ideas generally.",

            "answer": "Yes. In a few cases, again we've run the Elevator twice. We've had twenty six ideas submitted the first time, the second time thirty six.So they're not enormous amounts of ideas. They didn't get an enormous amount of traction. But certainly on both times we've allowed people to comment on ideas and interesting comments have been put on. Sometimes saying this will never work, sometimes have you seen someone has already done the idea, sometimes saying I'm interested and they'd like to be involved and sometimes people have contacted people. I know for example a commercial organisation contacted one of the students before they got funded because they were interested in their idea. So yes there have been some inside benefits in terms of  making contacts, networking and sometimes learning that there's other things going on. But not perhaps as much as there could be. One of the things I'd really like to see Elevator do in terms of something we've always intended from the start is move from a demand exercise which is essentially what it is at the moment we put an idea up there and we assess the demand for it in terms of votes, to some kind of team forming exercise. I think that's how it would work in an ideal world. Someone would put an idea up there, a team would form around the idea. So people who could help deliver certain things about the idea or work together or look for an opportunity to trial the idea or offer expertise or critical mentorship for the idea any kind of addition for it and then instead of the most popular idea getting funded, the strongest team ends up getting funded around the idea. So it's a more practical instance, the level of excitement about the idea, to gauge the level of excitement and the acceptability of the idea. People who are actually dedicating time and effort or saying they will give time and effort to an idea seems to be a stronger thing than a lot of people ust saying - Yes, I quite like that. So in an ideal world if we could make that work, i think it's quite complex to make it work but in an ideal word that's how I'd like to see it working and i think that could kind of get at some of the things, the reason behind the question of what are the other benefits to being open i think that's a really interesting prospect that I'd like to have time to explore.",

            "answer": "The main thing is two things, one - just a very practical issue of getting a website to do that elegantly isn't trivial. It's easy to do voting there is a drupal plugin. It's simple. Working out the mechanism to form a team is much more difficult than voting cause team formation is quite, start ups say the thing that you should always focus on you should start early and focus on the hiring of the team. Formation is one of the most important things and to expect that to coalesce magically around an idea is a bit fanciful. So i think it would need some kind of, in my experience that doesn't happen naturally. People saying - Yes, let's work together,  I've just never seen that happen before in a virtual way. I've seen it happen before in a physical way, face to face meetings. But never in a virtual way. So getting over those practical web problems initially is what I'm talking about  and then there's the issue of choice of ownership and things like that. So you've put your idea up there and then would you really ust want to have anyone available in the community to work with you on it. Probably you wouldn't want to leave it that open an idea. Here's my idea and anyone could work openly. There's a study done by musicals. I forget who it was done by and what the name of it was but they developed something called a Que something or other a Que ratio or something and what they did was they studied the success of the musicals and the make up pf the teams behind them and they found there's streets wide diversity between them. Teams who all knew each other and teams where no-one knew each other. It seemed like the sweet spot was teams that mostly knew each other but with some new people. Enough to bring in new ideas to challenge the status quo. So enough to have a successful way of working and understand each others way of working and just be successful as a team but that thirst of new ideas, challenges to break open assumptions or to try new ways of doing it. To bring in fresh new ideas and that's why i imagine you'd need on something like that, what you'd want is a team to come up with that idea and a team that's newly formed and for them to say what else do we need in terms of expertise or to be open to things they hadn't thought of or people they hadn't thought of getting involved. There is also another example of something like this where the website site like inocentive. Inocentive is an open innovation website where companies have problems and they say - we're having a problem with this chemical engineering issue and ask them to solve it. They frequently solve the problems that are up there but they frequently solve  i can't remember the exact figures but they are often solved by people in a different discipline who have seen the idea up there. So i think rather than just a complete team formation you'd want something like that probably because a complete team would be fanciful and wouldn't be ideal, a team of strangers. So i think to do it properly you'd need that kind of thought  and I'm thinking on my feet as I've not thought about it enough. I think that's what you'd need, it's one aspect of it. The second aspect of it and the more practical aspect of it is say for example you'd got a good team a team with a core of people who knew each other and all knew the idea but with some fresh new people coming in as part of the process. Then you'd have to tackle the other practical issues around how they work together and that's something we have quite a lot of experience in in Jisc. A lot of the work we do is with distributed people and distributed teams rather than co-located teams just as Jisc as an organization itself is  distributed and co-located. Most of my colleagues are elsewhere. I don't think that's uncommon now in academia. More and more teams are geographically distributed. I'm not sure it's completely optimal in a lot of ways. Certainly methodology like agile, assume and co-location.You see start ups again and start ups in innovative tech companies spend an enormous amount of time thinking about who sits where in the office and that sort of thing. I met one the other day where they change their seating arrangement every two months making sure that the right personalities are sitting with each other. So it shows co-location is incredibly important but we don't always have that luxury. So we have to find ways around that and using things like Google docs. depending on what you're doing but Google docs. Github, blogs, more corporate systems like sharepoint all that kind of thing is really important. Also finding methodologies that work is also important. So Agile works extremely well for technology projects but if you're a distributed team it's not really designed for you. Assume is co-location and meeting standard and all that kind of stuff. But you can still use the same principal in a distributed team, regular conversations, not planning in detail too far ahead, making yourself able to change direction and pivot as things happen and so i think taking all those principals and apply it to your team but you just have to be aware of that and plan slightly differently. That's even more difficult if say ninety percent of the team are located in one place and ten percent are located elsewhere. How do you stop that person becoming disconnected, marginalised? their opinions, feeling frustrated that nothing their doing is.  So there are all of those issued with team building which is why virtually going the other way is easier, it gets us somewhere. But in an ideal world, i think if we are, someone said to me just today that often in innovation people focus too much on ideas and less on execution and i worry that something like the Elevator is doing that. It is focused on ideas because there is a demand for ideas but if we really wanted to do this well we'd focus on execution. So how we form the team, who's in the team, how they work together and focusing in detail on that may well end up with better results. Initially putting all your focus on the ideas but obviously as i say it's not terribly straight forward to do that.",

Have you any of your own ideas yet about, there's a lot of barriers to being able to form a team like that because the makeup of the way humans interact, like we may be at different universities, some of us are at organizations, some of us are commercial, some of us are in places like Jisc which has a different position to say the universities themselves and so on.

If Jisc can act as an agent that can help people produce things that do help universities and colleges do things better help improve the student experience that's something that's worth doing. It's  goal. It's interesting. I guess if i was trying to be less lofty I'd say it's because your competitive i think as well cause you want to make sure that what you do is good and you've got pride in what you do and you want to make sure the things you do are good. So you spend a lot of time thinking about how to do them better. I also think that I'm very fidgety from the video you'll have noticed, but in my mind I'm very fidgety i get restless very easily and then I'm never happy I'm never satisfied. I always want to improve things and when processes improve it seems to be an itch i can't scratch.

            "answer": "This is something that I'm permanently dissatisfied with. I have never found anything that made me happy. The one that I'm getting enough of what i need to read, there's always a real restlessness there - how can i get more things. I mean I've very little with patience, I'm very impatient with things. I don't tend to read modular scholar research because i don't tend to operate at that level of detail. That detail tends to be extraneous to me so i want to digest it a level above. But one of the things i am dissatisfied with is sharing, that's the most frustrating thing - how do we share effectively what we've learned? So generally i suppose my methods are three things. One is haphazard clicking. I would say the majority of what i do is haphazard clicking. I'll spend happily a couple of hours a day in work or out of work on my phone or whatever just clicking away and following things. Not like I've scheduled that time but it;s just what i do. I'll read something that will lead to something that will lead to something and that haphazard clicking now is generally quite a satisfying process. I don't, because of the level of detail I'm doing i don't tend to hit upon payables that often or if i do it tends to be books I'm paying for than other forms of research. I've just realised i don't  i don't know why. So that's haphazard clicking and that can be any source but it tends to rely on free data like wikipedia and blogs, magazines, places like the Orion Radar, Harvard Business Review, newspapers and that often leads you to something more detailed like books. So last year i started to read a lot more non-fiction. I read a lot about economics and innovation and statistics and predictions and complexities and things like that and that's all lead to stuff that interests me in a personal capacity and a work capacity. The third ones is social networks. I would say that's fairly massive. Most of the really genuinely new and interesting stuff that i hadn't followed for my own interest, that's the thing about the Google filter bubble is the social networks, there's where i get things that come out of the blue and surprise me from things like twitter and so on. But the most important thing is, and this is something that i read about again and again in books on innovation is talking, it's probably the least efficient but most effective method of finding out new things. So I'll start talking to someone in the office about something i read and half understood about statistics or something and then they'll tell me something else or a book they're reading and then I'll go off  and that's generally the most effective thing. I'll tell them about something I've read that i think is brilliant and they'll tell me it's rubbish for reasons i hadn't realised. Then that will send me off down another route. When i think about trying to systematise this better and trying to do this better that's often the bit i neglect. I often don;t think that     is inefficient it's haphazard. But i do think it's the single most effective thing, i remember reading about the economics of football and they were talking about how Britain is often tactically behind other nations in British football and that was because of our separation in both in terms of geographical separation from the European continent where the innovations are coming from. Places like Holland and Spain. Spain more recently, but Holland and Germany in the seventies and so on and it's only recently that we've started to catch up. It's people talking and sharing of information that is really key to making sure that people advance and you see geographical corporations like Silicon Valley based on the fact of sharing knowledge so some innovation books call it knowledge pull over. The ability to make sure that you're in the conversation that you are networking with people who have these ideas and doing things differently to make it challenging and they said the in this book about football is you often see the most successful managers are more networked. They talked specifically about Sir Alex Ferguson and said he spends an enormous amount of time on the phone or talking to other managers in what could seem like, if you were auditing it from the outside, casual chatter but that was an essential way he found out about all sorts of other stuff that was going around you know players that were available, tactics, ideas all of that kind of stuff. As i get old from experience i realised how much more important that was. So from experience I've realised how important that was. I mean five years or ten years ago i would have said that we could do it on line better by book marking it or something like that. But now if i spend all of my day in meetings just talking to people then to some extent probably no work gets done, it's a day wasted. As long as it wasn't a frustrating conversation or going round in circles i would now envisage that to be an effective way to start sharing knowledge and learning stuff. It's a rambling answer",

That's one of the interesting things is that a lot what we're going to be doing in the next year or so is fairly near term stuff so service development, product development that kind of stuff so things that aren't speculative or experimental but things that are fairly safe bets. So I'd of thought that because they are near term stuff then a lot of the interesting things that are developing may not have that much of an impact in the next year or so. I mean obviously things like open access and things like that are getting more prevalent and will have an interesting impact but i wonder if that's a bit further ahead than what we'll be doing now. I can't think of anything in particular that would be terribly important or interesting. That's probably shortsighted of me, one of the things that this job has taught me over the last seven years is that my predictions and opinions aren't worth anything.

If there's a bizarre mess up with the computers,and you only have limited access to it, OK i did it i had a couple of articles that i really needed to get hold of before Christmas and i basically ran out of time to use them because of the weird gate keeping they do on those things and it's really frustrating to try and get in contact with someone who can sort those things out for you as it was a couple more days before i could get access to them again. So that's the first thing i do. The second thing is - there is a repository called ARC.com which is an open access peer to peer sharing network for academics basically.

The other thing i might do actually is e-mail the author. So that if it's something that i really want to read, i have done that before, i have e-mailed somebody and they have e-mailed me recently to get something. So obviously it only works if you have some pre existing thing. But it is a nice thing to do as well i think, as people like it when you're interested in their things. I think for me, it's not the same as other forms of copy write - retaining creative control over a film, where the money is going into the film. Where as with the journal articles i don't get the sense, it's almost an anti-benefit to the author. The only reason they do it is because of the research excellence framework, you need a number. You need a certain number of things in journals, you need a certain number of things to get a job. It is very difficult to get a job as an early career researcher. So you are forced to do these things which seem to be oppositional to what you want to do. Also the boundaries are always shifting. You don't know. Every thing's got politics to it and you don't know, suddenly i can't access these journals does that mean that somewhere else someone looked to. You never know what's going on with the publisher relationships - has someone upped the rates and that's why we haven't got them or has money been going elsewhere, It's not very transparent.",

But i had something recently in a journal, a well known and respected journal in our field so i was really pleased and the peer review process was amazing. I didn't expect it but i got amazing feedback and it was like being part of a knowledge community. It was really helpful and really great and i thought, this is how it should be. This is what peer review should be about. The when it got published it was difficult for people to get access to and it was quite nice because i did get a couple of e-mails from people saying could you e-mail me the article but officially the way i should have done it was, you get a link fro the publisher saying you get 23 downloads and to share the link with your friends. You were supposed to spread this link with your friends so they could read your article and i thought that's cool Then my first horrible thought was -  OK that will look good for me in terms of stats and hits to link to my article and then i thought - that's hideous. So I've not shared it with anyone but if someone e-mails me asking for a copy of the article I'll share it with them. Well it depends, I've had some horrible ones too. I think it's one of these things that because of RAG and because of undue pressure on it when what it's fundamentally about is supporting you as a researcher and giving you constructive feedback and I've had a few rejctions but i feel that the process has been almost an extension of my PhD of where I've developed my work. It's been really helpful exen though it's not nice to be rejected. Some of the feedback has been just as helpful and honed my work in a particular way.

That makes you feel bad, it's not constructive. Unfortunately that can happen in the peer review process. I have had great experiences but i've heard and seen that and some of my colleagues who are well published and well known get that from their work just because their work is valid i think and i think for that to happen in a public forum as a PhD student could be problematic, demoralising and humiliating. I think the question is more, to what extent does the whole system need to be changed in order for that to work as a thing, because i do think things are changing slowly. I think people have got more concerned about being constructive and have slowly realised that you can't be so dismissive of people and you can't be, i think it's changing but i don't know if",

It doesn't necessarily guarantee it, especially if it's from a different disciplinary perspective. They might be just working through ideas that have happened elsewhere at different points. I think it's to do with what you bring to it as well and how you interpret things. What i see as really useful, is that you know the key things in your field, the key developments and good peer review should be about that you have filled in those gaps and you have got all the context and that you're not trying to claim something that's novel that's been done. It should be about producing knowledge, that's what it's about. It's not about publishing for the sake of it and if you're rehashing something that's been said elsewhere but trying to give it a new label then that isn't about producing knowledge that's just publishing for the sake of publishing.

So i think there is a push on one level for open access for the broader scale, sort of governmental shifts which i don't know if that's going to be enacted so it's mutually beneficial to everybody. I don't know if the motivations are geared towards the genuine production of knowledge. On the other hand, our discipline is quite political and i know that Colin's work, he was keen to have it downloaded for free on open access because of political commitments and i think that within our discipline there is that desire to try and make things freely available. It's just difficult for researchers to do that at the moment. I think it is changing though, slowly",

Even in terms of publishers there's hierarchy of which publishers are the best to publish in. A lot of academics don't know about and those that do know these things have generally got an insight. I think it's partly tradition and partly this push to be able to qualify for things, to quantify knowledge. If it's peer reviewed then that can be quantified on a good piece of work. I think it's those two and that it's a cultural thing. I think it's to do with the new globalisation of the university - thought I'd get that in there. But it is to do with being able to say OK, it is being used in a very specific way to say we are going to put this person on a personal teaching contract, Not in our department i would say, but I've heard of other institutions, being told that they are going to be put on teaching contracts because you have not met this number of publications.

I guess for me other than the broad sweeping arguments of, you can hear my accent I'm American so even though i have British citizenship and I'm applying for Australian citizenship. I've always been very sensitive to the fact that in spending tax payer money whether it be in the US, UK or Australia, that's what you're doing right and it's scary to look at someone who pays taxes and say - i'm spending your money and yet i don't have the same accent as you or the same ideals of user patriotism as you. That type of thing, so that's always mattered to me, to be defending that at a very real level. Now that's nice as a broad sweeping argument, but the moment you get into the long tailed discussion of kind of opening up something like bio-medical data or something and you get into a conversation about anonomizing it or de-identifying it, there's a very long tailed discussion that has to occur in each one of the different disciplines and all the rest of it. For better or worse i feel that it does basically improve the rate and the speed of which scholarship occurs. If you can get the problems out of the way, if we can come up with a good de-identification or way of anonymizing the data, or tools or whatever, in a way that it can be made open then i actually feel that what that will do for researchers is that it will get them more research funding and save them time. So it comes down to a very real thing where researchers actually can say - because i opened up my data and put in that extra effort to anonymize it and now it's out there in the open, then said researcher across the country, the globe and I've seen this, I've friends, i'm much more closer to. People talk about international like they know what it it is, I've seen it. I've got a meta researcher in Oxford who's worked with a researcher in Melbourne who I've then connected to a researcher, you know who's in Sandeago and that's very real. It's a very small group but then they do really amazing and cool things. Most of the time it's the data, the tools, the method or the publication that's enabled them to participate and do things with that. So it isn't even about open. The word i use more than anything else is collaborative. Open enables collaboration.  Open is not a means to an end, collaboration is where we want to get researchers doing things and that involves all the problems of human psychology, of trust, of relationships and all the rest of it. But open is at least one pillar inside it being able to accelerate that place where we can collaborate that.",

I was a database developer in a very previous life and as a young person out of under grad who was doing database management that would have been my first experience and then you tend to look up and outside it wasn't just MIAS QL there was all these other things happening. My career has actually allotted to 15 years of    for being a database developer. You just realise how amazing it is with all the opens that are out there. I love open hardware right now, reprinting and sharing all of that stuff is amazing but there is another hundred of those opens that all provide that same thing. All that by opening up what they're doing, they create more collaboration and they do what humans want to do which is socialise, share things, trust one another to produce better things that actually we can't do as individuals anymore and we have to do it in group scenarios in group things.",

But the cool thing about it is again isn't the technology, it's the fact that it allows us to openly share things. One of my favourite examples is what i call the ball of clay example, which is, normally people have got Tab software, 3-D software and the problem with that is that you're doing it by yourself. It's like you standing over a ball of clay and doing the whole thing together so it's cut scene and now imagine ghost and there's a ball of clay between the two of us. Being able to both put our hands on that and form it together, that's the amazing possibility of collaboration. So it took an open piece of technology to enable that, researcher doesn't even know it's called open stac, they ust know that they now have this share of a piece of software that they're using sitting on the cloud and it enables them to be both looking at this thing with one another and it's interesting as open stac is now open, but the software we're using isn't necessarily open. But it's enough open that it's enabled the collaboration in the community and that's what's exciting, because once you have two people using that, all of a sudden the ability to scale out and bring more and more people into the all of clay problem and that's what's cool. Unlike the physical enironment wher you can only maybe fit six hands on the ball of clay, in the digital space there is an upward number.",

            "answer": "It literally is the opportunity to collaborate. The whole point is that researchers feel alone and isolated in using their tools. I mean we did a tool audit of researchers at the Uni of Melbourne and we think, it's a very broad structure, back of a napkin time numbers right. Each department, five or six research tools, N number of departments times N number of international collaborations, subdivided by some core tools that people use. So we think it's like two hundred to five hundred tools sit on any given research canvas. Which isn't all that shocking really, i think that's pretty normal. But the point of that is that you do feel really alone in these tools. So a linguist doing tree maps will have these really niche bits of software which are really cool and powerful for them but they are actually quite old and one of the most difficult things is that they eventually get the thing up and working but then you're like well how do i do this? So the ability to turn around and ask somebody how to do that is really powerful and the other interesting side to that coin is, this is something I'm very passionate about, is you're never going to provide a help desk for that. That's one of the problems. IT, the traditional solution has been - here is a tool, let's provide a help desk. Hi i'm the researcher, I'm working on Indonesian languages from the sixth period such and such and i want to produce a tree diagram which works with this language and bridges to this language. That's impossible, We are never going to get a help desk for that type of thing. The only solution in this is community and collaboration, ergo back to my original point. If you don't have open, that's the other point, it enables more open. The diconomy of us buying a bunch of software to make it open. So we buy a site license that now allows us to use a piece of software so that it feels open to everybody on the campus. But the sad part is that that is kind of limiting because what we actually want to do is to make sure that our researcher working with the African researcher, with the Indian researcher or the Chinese researcher also has access to that tool and all of a sudden we are getting problems when in fact, they would much rather Skye their colleagues in Indian than necessarily turn around and ask someone round the corner?",

Thus far the way we've been doing that is, again this goes back to the developer community giving them a list serve, giving them some tags to be able to talk about on whether that's Google plus, twitter or face book and then encouraging face to face. So we do have a really big advantage i that we are on a campus in the Uni of Melbourne. We are not distributed. So for us the technology tools - list ser, the twitter, all of that is actually a function of getting people together face to face because again it's hierarchy right. You get open, I've got to get trust and you're not usually going to get trust by someone tweeting one or another. So usually the fastest way to get trust is to have a face to face conversation and then all of a sudden the tools start to enable this collaboration. But we've got to build trust and i'm not saying you can't do trustified tools and e-mails or something or maybe Skye or whatever. But for me the fastest way we have always been able to achieve that is by face to face. Get the people together, get the linguist talking with other art historians. They all of a sudden are willing to e-mail each other and trust and it's not necessarily like the list serve right, they would rather e-mail me and then have a quite conversation on the side than put it out on the list serve. Researchers are inherently private people.",

I mean most IT departments in universities are very very comfortable with help desks now and to propose that instead you are going to you this hippie free wheeling mechanism to do self supporting networks, it feels more like alcoholics anonymous than it feels like an official enterprise IT support department and yet I'm open for other discussions. Although saying that, what i do find interesting is that the open technology allows us to carry that on. One of the cool things is that by utilising the cloud and by utilising open stac, means that when a researcher comes along and uses a tool, at least that tool is still there. So there is a chance for further collaborations to occur beyond the life of the one person using it. In the old days it would have been - I've uploaded the tool, i have a ton of mail on my desk top my laptop either gets tossed or out the window. So we've then lost that persons project, their tool and most importantly we've lost the persons knowledge. I can't say the persons knowledge, they've moved on and that's the whole goal. But if we can save their tool and their data and get them to sign off on something at the end of their time here with us saying - i don't mind if you keep this data and this tool. That's a lot easier than us going and saying - can i have the stuff off your laptop. If it's already sitting in out network, secure and controlled but then we later go along and say, hey we've got this tool and another post graduate wants to use your tool that you built or the modifications then we're hoping that's the outcome. But again, ask me in eighteen months and I'll have a better idea.",

Just because i have built ambassador champion programmes before so i know what it means to have to get your ambassadors and champions and incentivize them, how to deal with the fact that when you loose them, how to role out new ones and all the rest of it. Community building i am pretty comfortable with. What will be really interesting is how well we can do with, the best part is Post Graduates are absolutely the best group of people you can have for ambassadors and champions - incredibly smart, not a lot of money so motivating them isn't incredibly hard, really altruistic. Most post graduates inertly care about and are open right and into doing things new. They're not like old professors and there's a lot of them. In the university of Melbourne there's twenty five thousand of them who have taught and researched there so i think we have a really large pool of people and basically for some pizza money and maybe sending them to a conference every now and again. I've got myself, for the cost of one salary member, i reckon i could have twenty five post graduate champions each representing the different areas for the same cost. It's maybe me playing a little bit fast and loose but why not utilise volunteer organisational structures where this is borrowed from. Me understanding the national   society and they way to do community building with the open knowledge foundation. Those skills all come together and we are utilising just a different structure than the help desk. We are utilising the community structure and it's a valid structure. It really does work and most importantly if you don't believe me go and look in any of thee big open source communities. They scale to potentially millions. So in theory it should be easy.",

There have been all these tools created for researchers to do different things but now we're starting to have the forming stage where finally people are starting to centre around certain very specific tools and it's tools like map lab and R stat and svss and stata and excel obviously. But there are starting to become some coalescence inside of these. Now what i find really interesting, is that the cats software we're using is going to become really core research software that people use. My question is will that be, and I'm back and forth on that a lot, like i said, what i care about is not that the tools open. I care that it has the largest possibility to have the largest community group because i can't support that tool myself. I can't have a help desk. I need that community whether that be the university of Melbourne community or even better a world wide community to say - we all support R stat as a statistical programming tool to be able to do all of our graphs inside of our research papers. My worry with that is that, R stat is great because it is a world wide community where as something like map lab costs a lot of money to do. So it's very privileged and university of Melbourne is the number one research uni in Australia and obviously can afford that and it needs a lot of money to do those things. We have a very large budget for buying research tools but i don't know that that's the best thing for research as a whole and Australia know this. The number of Chinese universities coming on line and even coming into the top one hundred universities. Even Africa's going up. Those groups could disruptabley innovate the whole thing and switch the thing around because they will be using a different tool and they will be over here. So i really believe it's important that we have to figure out a way to keep people in open tools and again, it's not because it's open it's because my researchers will have the best opportunities to find people to trust and collaborate with around the world because again, research is niche. It's really difficult to find someone who does know the Latin for this period and this region. There are only going to be two or three other people on the planet legitimately and if that persons using R Stat and the other persons using Map Lab they won't work with one another. They might have a conversation but the moment they have a tool they can work with one another, they are solving a problem with one another and that's what brings people together and that's what builds trust. It needs to be a shared tool and so some disciplines might decide that mathmatica is the tool that all mathematicians need to use and fair enough. As long as that's defacto.",

Anyone who has ever passed around revisions and I'm talking pure features whether it's open or closed. But the problem with word is that it's legitimately a bad technology for collaborating because passing reviews around means they are all out of sync and somebodies got to bring them back together. I really love google docs. If i said a preference right now, i would say google docs. For the most part at least it's free to use so there's not a barrier there, people can collaborate. But again the problem with Google docs is that it can lead to imbed the science and the data inside of it. You can do it to some degree and this is the point - once you start to collaborate and write a document with one another that's one thing. It's another thing once you start to do experiments and you need to pull the experiments inside of the research to do that. You have your experiment there and them most importantly once your experiments inside of that, what do you do? You then go out to your peer review and you get critiques about why everything is wrong. So then you're in a place again, just like the word document with reviews and it's oh shit we have to change all the graphs in this paper so that they line up with all the formulas along with all the tables and actually google docs. starts to fail there as well and then you move onto the next step. This is what i find really interesting is again back to the developer community, the developers are the ones who are dealing in this ultra collaborative space. They've invented tools like Latex and Mark Down and that's what i would see as the future as they are being able to write something and collaborate on it all at the same time like google docs. and then have peer review come in to it. Look at the data, change it. allow errors and ultimate revisions and then have versions all the way back. From inception of one author, to six authors writing it together to the editorials looking at it, to peer review giving comments back to it, to re-editing it. Thats' the whole chain that needs to be there. Not that any one's going to look at it but it should be there.",

That's the nice thing about advocating this, is it's valuable to write research type stuff papers and there's a lot to be said for the scholarly method. How you put things through peer review.

I don't really know, I've never really published in nature and what happens when you have one hundred thousand people ask you a question because you have invented an idea. I have no idea about that. But what i do know, as a minor researcher in my own field is that it's a lot more advantageous for me to be out there than in some little shitty journal that i think people don't care about. The nice bit, again going back to the post graduates, that's what the post graduates are - post graduates are early career researchers. That are learning to do it that way and the whole point is that these post graduate researchers aren't going to be an Einstein or a Dawkins. It's just not going to happen. They're going to be minor researchers their entire life and they are going to have to fight and struggle to get research publications and frankly having a blog and pushing your ideas out there and doing revisions openly and utilising these tool chains. That gives you what is seen as being busy in the space, which builds up trust which gives you the next research grant. So we suffer in academia extremely about fame. Secretly, and they won't tell you this, most post graduates, and they should have this dream, in the same way that the entrepreneur thinks that they are going to be the next Bill Gates or the next Zuckerburg. Most researchers think - I'm secretly going to be the next Einstein. You're not, statistically you're not. You know this and you should know better than most because you actually have the mathematical skills but that's the point.
