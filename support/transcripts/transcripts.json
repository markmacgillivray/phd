        "ANSWER": "I'm Andy McGregor, i just got a new job so from the 1st January I'm now Deputy Chief Innovation Officer here at Jisc. Obviously it's a new job so it's still being defined but mainly it means that I'll have responsibility for defining the approach which Jisc takes to doing innovation. So my job is mainly process based. We're going to be using an approach to innovation that we've been piloting for the past year called Co-design and that's now been in used for all Jisc projects. It's my job to scale it up and to make sure the Jisc projects can work with them and all new projects come from that process. Obviously I'll oversee the projects that come out of that, the innovation projects that come out of that process. So it is a process based job now.",

        "ANSWER": "So the reason Jisc is interested in Co-design is because of the Wilson review. So in 2010 amid the financial crisis the government had a look at all the various organizations that were funded by the government. Jisc was reviewed by Wilson. That's why it's called the Wilson review and he had a number of things to say about all aspects of Jisc but innovation he had a few particular things to say about, one - that we did too many things, two - that they didn't always have the impact they should have because we were probably doing too many things and three - the process by which some of those things were agreed and started was often opaque. So Co-design as an approach innovation was a response to that to try and address some of those concerns. It does that by ensuring that key stake holders for the sector, the people who are going to use the things that innovation produces are involved in the process right from the very start and right throughout. So i don't mean that they are just consulted or they are used as a steering group. They are actually the people who we work with in a collaborative way to define what we are going to do, how are we going to do it and if we do it what success looks like for them. So last year we piloted that and the pilot was successful enough for us to scale it up. So that's the organizational reason. For me, what's led to that is, I've worked here in Jisc for about six or seven years now and throughout that time I've been involved in project in a number of different areas. I don't really have any expertise in a library background. I don't really have expertise in these. I can understand the technical stuff but I'm not technical. So i started off with repositories. I did activity data, open data, resource discovery. Quite a lot of library stuff and quite a lot of developer community stuff and a few bits around different types of innovation processes and throughout that, the common thread was, that i was interested in, were processes that define how we engage the creative people in higher education and how we engage them, how we ensure that all their creativity benefited as many people as possible. So i got more and more interested in the processes rather than the actually subjects where as my colleagues are more interested in the subject. So there research data programme manager they research data or the might be really interested in open data. I ended up being more and more interested in the processes and that's what i love focussing on and so when the Jisc leadership decided they wanted someone to look at processes, look at this new co-design approach and implement it, it was fortunate for me that i happened to have some spare time. Having expressed interest in this area that they asked me to look at and so i was able to take the outline of this process they defined, design the process and implement it. It has been a slow process over a number of years, moving away from expressing an interest in the sole object of what Jisc does and more about how Jisc does it. That's personally how Co-design came about for me.",

        "ANSWER": "Co-design is still very much a rough thing. It's not polished yet, it might not ever be polished. Polished is the enemy of good process because it ridgefies it and rigid hierarchies in many studies have shown to be counter-productive for innovation. So at the moment it's rough and we're developing it and polishing it but stake holders are one of the things that we have put more thought into because it's at the heart of it. As far as i see it there are three levels of engagement for stakeholders. The top is the kind of strategist level. Those are the people who are almost a kin to the organization who do say - this is what we want done, these are our needs and this is what we want done to address our needs. If you are going to successfully address these needs, this is what you need to do. So essentially they give you a strategic direction a strategic imperative for setting off in a direction. The co-designers at that level you would expect to be people like directors of IT, people like senior librarians, people like heads of E-learning, people like planners, finance directors, registrars. Essentially the people who organize in the institution, the college, the university etc who would be ultimately the people who would be signing off on the adoption of any product that was produced by innovation. They would make a decision whether to buy it. So they are the ultimate customer. They represent the people who if we're going to produce something, it has to meet their needs to be successful. So they operate at the strategist level. The next level down is the designer level. So once the strategist has identified a problem or an area of investigation or opportunity or idea. The experts from higher education institution s, from commercial organizations, from really anyone that's relevant. Jisc would convene them to work out how to go about addressing that opportunity or that problem and that would be the design stage and that could be broad array of people could be engaged in that area of design. From your expert developers through to your practitioners through to the senior managers who could again be involved in that level, people outside of the sectors such as commercial people could be involved, consultants such as Cottage Labs, people like that would be relevant there, people from government. You could imagine a vast different array. The point of that is that is supposed to be flexible diverse cause study after study shows that for innovation to work, diversity is the key ingredient to making innovation successful. So those are there and at the base level after you have designed something, you have to do it. So you've got the developer's, the doers whatever you want to call them, the implementers. The people who would go away and deliver the design. That's how i view Co-design, kind of these three stages of engagement and people could be engaged to co-design a project at any one of those levels. In the pilot we generally call people at the strategy level the co-designees, but really we've engaged a broad array of people to help us design and deliver the project and it's probably not that new to Jisc. We have always engaged widely what's different now is the systematised and the strategy level, the top level where people are involved much earlier in the decision process that they were before making it much more transparent and open in terms of what we're doing and why we're doing it and who we're doing it for.",

        "ANSWER": "Well the Wilson review is one. The Wilson review did state that some Jisc processes were opaque and needed to be addressed and we did not meet customer needs. But obviously transparency has an enormous amount of benefits for innovation in general i think. One of which is diversity. Transparency enables people to be aware of what's happening and to be aware of how they can get involved and how it fits with the things they're doing and that leads to greater serendipity, greater knowledge spill over between different projects, greater diversity of input which should lead to stronger ideas. It also should lead in theory to more work done in the margins. Obviously organizations like 3M show and in fact research in general shows that lots of interesting stuff happens in the margins. So where disciplines meet or the margins where technologies meet. IN 3M for example i read that they developed a glue that was so strong it could be used for sound dampening in air craft engines. You wouldn't think that glue could do something like that but it's because they have these intersections, these margins where they are able to do interesting things like that. I think transparency is one of the key things to help leave the opportunity open for those kind of interesting things to arise in the margins. Finally i think it's important for people, obviously Jisc works with public money or institutions money so it's important for them to know purely where their money is spent and why it's spent and how it's being done. I think that is important anyway because it's a general principal. I think there are a number of reasons - Wilson, innovation reasons and just plain good management reasons. I think transparency for all of those reasons.",

        "ANSWER": "It has. But often not as much as feared, i have found. One example is we developed a site called Jisc Elevator. This is a site where people can put ideas, generally for small projects on the site. They do a video picture of their idea and a short description, people can vote on that idea and if successful they get funded. We have used that a couple of times now and one of the key arguments against doing Elevator, in the early days when we were said should we do it, people said people don't like sharing their ideas and i had some experience of that previously where we'd issued a call for funding and we'd tried to get, encourage people to be openly sharing ideas beforehand and only two people did. We got quite a few bits back but only two people shared them. Probably just coincidence but those two were two of the strongest bids. I don't know if you can draw any conclusions from this as it's a small number. But never the less it was interesting. But innovator, we just haven't experienced any problems. People are very happy to put their ideas on there, very happy to share them openly. These are small ideas and that may be the difference and often their not researched in a way they are innovation which you could say, innovations the step after research. Research happens to invent something and then innovation comes along to make use of that. Amongst students particularly, so the recent Elovation competition was aimed at students and they had no fear, no qualms what so ever about sharing their ideas publicly. But that does contradict with previous things where we've tried to encourage openness and it hasn't happened. Although the difference is, Elevator required openness where you share your ideas openly and people are fine with that. We encouraged it and made a requirement of it. It didn't happen so there was no incentive to do it there i guess other than for it suited your own personal way of working. Maybe it's not that common in academia. I don't want too make to many suppositions there as it's not an area i know a lot about. My experience is, certainly with Elevator, they are quite happy to share ideas generally.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes. In a few cases, again we've run the Elevator twice. We've had twenty six ideas submitted the first time, the second time thirty six.So they're not enormous amounts of ideas. They didn't get an enormous amount of traction. But certainly on both times we've allowed people to comment on ideas and interesting comments have been put on. Sometimes saying this will never work, sometimes have you seen someone has already done the idea, sometimes saying I'm interested and they'd like to be involved and sometimes people have contacted people. I know for example a commercial organisation contacted one of the students before they got funded because they were interested in their idea. So yes there have been some inside benefits in terms of  making contacts, networking and sometimes learning that there's other things going on. But not perhaps as much as there could be. One of the things I'd really like to see Elevator do in terms of something we've always intended from the start is move from a demand exercise which is essentially what it is at the moment we put an idea up there and we assess the demand for it in terms of votes, to some kind of team forming exercise. I think that's how it would work in an ideal world. Someone would put an idea up there, a team would form around the idea. So people who could help deliver certain things about the idea or work together or look for an opportunity to trial the idea or offer expertise or critical mentorship for the idea any kind of addition for it and then instead of the most popular idea getting funded, the strongest team ends up getting funded around the idea. So it's a more practical instance, the level of excitement about the idea, to gauge the level of excitement and the acceptability of the idea. People who are actually dedicating time and effort or saying they will give time and effort to an idea seems to be a stronger thing than a lot of people ust saying - Yes, I quite like that. So in an ideal world if we could make that work, i think it's quite complex to make it work but in an ideal word that's how I'd like to see it working and i think that could kind of get at some of the things, the reason behind the question of what are the other benefits to being open i think that's a really interesting prospect that I'd like to have time to explore.",

If it was mandated that they must share them and then presumably ones that get elevated get something in return for having shared them.

Did you get any other interesting things coming up because of the sharing going on?",

        "ANSWER": "The main thing is two things, one - just a very practical issue of getting a website to do that elegantly isn't trivial. It's easy to do voting there is a drupal plugin. It's simple. Working out the mechanism to form a team is much more difficult than voting cause team formation is quite, start ups say the thing that you should always focus on you should start early and focus on the hiring of the team. Formation is one of the most important things and to expect that to coalesce magically around an idea is a bit fanciful. So i think it would need some kind of, in my experience that doesn't happen naturally. People saying - Yes, let's work together,  I've just never seen that happen before in a virtual way. I've seen it happen before in a physical way, face to face meetings. But never in a virtual way. So getting over those practical web problems initially is what I'm talking about  and then there's the issue of choice of ownership and things like that. So you've put your idea up there and then would you really ust want to have anyone available in the community to work with you on it. Probably you wouldn't want to leave it that open an idea. Here's my idea and anyone could work openly. There's a study done by musicals. I forget who it was done by and what the name of it was but they developed something called a Que something or other a Que ratio or something and what they did was they studied the success of the musicals and the make up pf the teams behind them and they found there's streets wide diversity between them. Teams who all knew each other and teams where no-one knew each other. It seemed like the sweet spot was teams that mostly knew each other but with some new people. Enough to bring in new ideas to challenge the status quo. So enough to have a successful way of working and understand each others way of working and just be successful as a team but that thirst of new ideas, challenges to break open assumptions or to try new ways of doing it. To bring in fresh new ideas and that's why i imagine you'd need on something like that, what you'd want is a team to come up with that idea and a team that's newly formed and for them to say what else do we need in terms of expertise or to be open to things they hadn't thought of or people they hadn't thought of getting involved. There is also another example of something like this where the website site like inocentive. Inocentive is an open innovation website where companies have problems and they say - we're having a problem with this chemical engineering issue and ask them to solve it. They frequently solve the problems that are up there but they frequently solve  i can't remember the exact figures but they are often solved by people in a different discipline who have seen the idea up there. So i think rather than just a complete team formation you'd want something like that probably because a complete team would be fanciful and wouldn't be ideal, a team of strangers. So i think to do it properly you'd need that kind of thought  and I'm thinking on my feet as I've not thought about it enough. I think that's what you'd need, it's one aspect of it. The second aspect of it and the more practical aspect of it is say for example you'd got a good team a team with a core of people who knew each other and all knew the idea but with some fresh new people coming in as part of the process. Then you'd have to tackle the other practical issues around how they work together and that's something we have quite a lot of experience in in Jisc. A lot of the work we do is with distributed people and distributed teams rather than co-located teams just as Jisc as an organization itself is  distributed and co-located. Most of my colleagues are elsewhere. I don't think that's uncommon now in academia. More and more teams are geographically distributed. I'm not sure it's completely optimal in a lot of ways. Certainly methodology like agile, assume and co-location.You see start ups again and start ups in innovative tech companies spend an enormous amount of time thinking about who sits where in the office and that sort of thing. I met one the other day where they change their seating arrangement every two months making sure that the right personalities are sitting with each other. So it shows co-location is incredibly important but we don't always have that luxury. So we have to find ways around that and using things like Google docs. depending on what you're doing but Google docs. Github, blogs, more corporate systems like sharepoint all that kind of thing is really important. Also finding methodologies that work is also important. So Agile works extremely well for technology projects but if you're a distributed team it's not really designed for you. Assume is co-location and meeting standard and all that kind of stuff. But you can still use the same principal in a distributed team, regular conversations, not planning in detail too far ahead, making yourself able to change direction and pivot as things happen and so i think taking all those principals and apply it to your team but you just have to be aware of that and plan slightly differently. That's even more difficult if say ninety percent of the team are located in one place and ten percent are located elsewhere. How do you stop that person becoming disconnected, marginalised? their opinions, feeling frustrated that nothing their doing is.  So there are all of those issued with team building which is why virtually going the other way is easier, it gets us somewhere. But in an ideal world, i think if we are, someone said to me just today that often in innovation people focus too much on ideas and less on execution and i worry that something like the Elevator is doing that. It is focused on ideas because there is a demand for ideas but if we really wanted to do this well we'd focus on execution. So how we form the team, who's in the team, how they work together and focusing in detail on that may well end up with better results. Initially putting all your focus on the ideas but obviously as i say it's not terribly straight forward to do that.",

Have you any of your own ideas yet about, there's a lot of barriers to being able to form a team like that because the makeup of the way humans interact, like we may be at different universities, some of us are at organizations, some of us are commercial, some of us are in places like Jisc which has a different position to say the universities themselves and so on. Have you any ideas on how you might tackle those problems, of say three or four different people all from these different kinds of place, they all want to work on an idea but how would you help them do so?

        "ANSWER": "I haven't had much time to think about this. It's something i do because I'm supposed to do it. So it's what someones asked me to do! I guess it's because to some extent i think the things that we're doing and if they are done well are worthwhile. They are worth doing. If Jisc can act as an agent that can help people produce things that do help universities and colleges do things better help improve the student experience that's something that's worth doing. It's  goal. It's interesting. I guess if i was trying to be less lofty I'd say it's because your competitive i think as well cause you want to make sure that what you do is good and you've got pride in what you do and you want to make sure the things you do are good. So you spend a lot of time thinking about how to do them better. I also think that I'm very fidgety from the video you'll have noticed, but in my mind I'm very fidgety i get restless very easily and then I'm never happy I'm never satisfied. I always want to improve things and when processes improve it seems to be an itch i can't scratch. When i see something and I've done something i think OK i could have done it this way, i could have done it that way i want to do it better next time. So there's always that kind of almost personal dissatisfaction that drives you on to do things. I think all of that would be the same even if i perhaps didn't believe in it as much as i do, but i think that plus the fact i do think that what Jisc does and especially the university of higher education sector does is worthwhile and important and is exciting. I think those two together make you want to try and do things better and improve things.",

        "ANSWER": "This is something that I'm permanently dissatisfied with. I have never found anything that made me happy. The one that I'm getting enough of what i need to read, there's always a real restlessness there - how can i get more things. I mean I've very little with patience, I'm very impatient with things. I don't tend to read modular scholar research because i don't tend to operate at that level of detail. That detail tends to be extraneous to me so i want to digest it a level above. But one of the things i am dissatisfied with is sharing, that's the most frustrating thing - how do we share effectively what we've learned? So generally i suppose my methods are three things. One is haphazard clicking. I would say the majority of what i do is haphazard clicking. I'll spend happily a couple of hours a day in work or out of work on my phone or whatever just clicking away and following things. Not like I've scheduled that time but it;s just what i do. I'll read something that will lead to something that will lead to something and that haphazard clicking now is generally quite a satisfying process. I don't, because of the level of detail I'm doing i don't tend to hit upon payables that often or if i do it tends to be books I'm paying for than other forms of research. I've just realised i don't  i don't know why. So that's haphazard clicking and that can be any source but it tends to rely on free data like wikipedia and blogs, magazines, places like the Orion Radar, Harvard Business Review, newspapers and that often leads you to something more detailed like books. So last year i started to read a lot more non-fiction. I read a lot about economics and innovation and statistics and predictions and complexities and things like that and that's all lead to stuff that interests me in a personal capacity and a work capacity. The third ones is social networks. I would say that's fairly massive. Most of the really genuinely new and interesting stuff that i hadn't followed for my own interest, that's the thing about the Google filter bubble is the social networks, there's where i get things that come out of the blue and surprise me from things like twitter and so on. But the most important thing is, and this is something that i read about again and again in books on innovation is talking, it's probably the least efficient but most effective method of finding out new things. So I'll start talking to someone in the office about something i read and half understood about statistics or something and then they'll tell me something else or a book they're reading and then I'll go off  and that's generally the most effective thing. I'll tell them about something I've read that i think is brilliant and they'll tell me it's rubbish for reasons i hadn't realised. Then that will send me off down another route. When i think about trying to systematise this better and trying to do this better that's often the bit i neglect. I often don;t think that     is inefficient it's haphazard. But i do think it's the single most effective thing, i remember reading about the economics of football and they were talking about how Britain is often tactically behind other nations in British football and that was because of our separation in both in terms of geographical separation from the European continent where the innovations are coming from. Places like Holland and Spain. Spain more recently, but Holland and Germany in the seventies and so on and it's only recently that we've started to catch up. It's people talking and sharing of information that is really key to making sure that people advance and you see geographical corporations like Silicon Valley based on the fact of sharing knowledge so some innovation books call it knowledge pull over. The ability to make sure that you're in the conversation that you are networking with people who have these ideas and doing things differently to make it challenging and they said the in this book about football is you often see the most successful managers are more networked. They talked specifically about Sir Alex Ferguson and said he spends an enormous amount of time on the phone or talking to other managers in what could seem like, if you were auditing it from the outside, casual chatter but that was an essential way he found out about all sorts of other stuff that was going around you know players that were available, tactics, ideas all of that kind of stuff. As i get old from experience i realised how much more important that was. So from experience I've realised how important that was. I mean five years or ten years ago i would have said that we could do it on line better by book marking it or something like that. But now if i spend all of my day in meetings just talking to people then to some extent probably no work gets done, it's a day wasted. As long as it wasn't a frustrating conversation or going round in circles i would now envisage that to be an effective way to start sharing knowledge and learning stuff. It's a rambling answer",

        "ANSWER": "No. But i have hopes in a number of areas just now i guess but i don't know if there is anything in particular. I am quite excited by things like the open data institute i think. That kind of practical use of open data and open data sharing is quite exciting. But i don't know how much that will impact the project we're working on at the moment. That's one of the interesting things is that a lot what we're going to be doing in the next year or so is fairly near term stuff so service development, product development that kind of stuff so things that aren't speculative or experimental but things that are fairly safe bets. So I'd of thought that because they are near term stuff then a lot of the interesting things that are developing may not have that much of an impact in the next year or so. I mean obviously things like open access and things like that are getting more prevalent and will have an interesting impact but i wonder if that's a bit further ahead than what we'll be doing now. I can't think of anything in particular that would be terribly important or interesting. That's probably shortsighted of me, one of the things that this job has taught me over the last seven years is that my predictions and opinions aren't worth anything. They have so often been proved wrong. I think that making predictions in this are is often not worth the paper they are written on. I can't think of anything in particular",

While i did that masters i was working for working for software development in their health science journals. But i always wanted to do study on top of that. Just to keep myself engaged and keep myself part of the research community and so forth and while working at we were building their entire platform and working a bit with the research community but not a great deal. What i found was a big publisher like that isn't very well connected with the research community and that was also very frustrating because we were building quite interesting products in the journal platforms but they weren't really available to anyone else in the community. One of the things that i suggested when i worked there was maybe we could get some of the people together and produce an open source version of their journals platform. That wasn't going to happen of course. So that's the kind of point where i started looking around at what's available for open source things and also for open access.",

        "ANSWER": "It was really an understanding that everything we were doing was closed. That 90% of the people in the world wouldn't have access to it That's not really what science is about or scholarship. So at the same time that i was at i was starting my PhD part time at UCL and i work with people in India predominantly and what i discovered was that no-one there could access the journals that we were producing. So i get about ten requests per month for papers and access to papers and various journals including my own stuff but other people's as well from India and that should prove the point that even though the big publishers say they make things available to people in the developing world, most of the time it's not practically the case and at the same time those people have problems publishing in our journals, difficulty in accessing our system whether it's because they don't have contacts or they are rejected during the peer review process because it's a little more tunnel visioned towards the western world etc. So there are a lot of issues there about open access itself and why that's really important.",

        "ANSWER": "Science is about advancing knowledge through research and it's a community thing. I don't think science is done by individual islands of people. Science only advances when these people work together and share their results. It's what we talk about as a social contract of science where you have an obligation to share your research with other researchers so they can validate what you've done but also so they can build upon it and advance science more efficiently and quickly. Any publication method or any method in the way you do your science that doesn't allow that, you can go as so far to say that it's malpractice. It's not following the social contract, it's not following the arrangement we all have, that we buy into. So that's where non open access publishing in a way is not following best practice. It's actually impeding science. Especially for people in the developing world or outside of the main stream university system. Even the entire commercial sector is shut out from a lot of scientific progress.",

But most people i think who worked in a place like us for a little bit are very disconnected from the research world. They don't meet researchers very frequently or if they do they are people at major institutions who had never considered the fact that someone couldn't access a journal.",

For example if i write a paper on Polio or something and it gets that doesn't mean that someone in Bangladesh or even South Africa can read that paper.

So a system to reward, things like the impact factor and so forth, they are very western centric systems and metrics which are designed to measure things according to the publishers world really. It's saying - you've published within our closed circle of journals and you've gotten citations within that we're going to ignore the fact that science is a global enterprise and that is should have social aims and so forth and we are going to focus on metrics which are purely about that and that's reinforced all the way through the university system and the hiring processes we have and so forth.Things like the ref. as well.",

Things like Science and even if the institution has a subscription and it can take me twenty minutes to actually access the information. That's pretty frustrating. I still come up as a student at UCI i still come up against journals that my institution doesn't have a subscription to, so i do have to e-mail authors once a month or so and that's frustrating. It's frustrating to log in and log out all the time. The fact that most of the things i cite aren't going to be readable by people in the countries I'm working in. So when i publish an article in India, most people can't access anything on my reference list and so the value of my work is then under played because it's introducing those people to new ideas but it's not enabling them to follow up on them and build upon them.",

But yes the thing's I'm citing and so forth might not be accessible. So it's up to me partly to try and make an effort to cite open source publications but in Archeology that's not very easy. There are very few open access publications outside the ones that we publish. So if I'm going to cite world Archeology which is in an category title at that time, no-one in India will really read it.",

        "ANSWER": "I signed the cost of knowledge petition saying i wouldn't work without severe because of their practices in lobbying against certain sciences and so forth. So i get asked fairly frequently to contribute to special collections in their journals and i say no. I also won't publish anywhere that's not open access anymore as it would be very hypocritical. So that means that i turn down 90% of the requests to publish. Or they make a special exception and say we will allow this to be open access. There was one big collection on open Archeology which i turned down writing for and they said basically everyone else was contributing because they wanted to reach the community that was closed and to change their minds in some way. So it was kind of a counter intuitive thing. Simply by refusing they would have had to change some how. I guess that the argument is that there is an old guard of researchers who don't understand that and who are still very much are part of the world that those publications make up and if you want to reach them then you still have to publish there but that's still not solving the problem. The majority of other people can't read it at all. So it's a little bit stupid. I think also that Archeology is changing because it's a very multi disciplined area and people are working on larger collaborative projects. They are starting to publish in things like Plos 1 and because of that they are becoming a bit more exposed to the open access world. They access other science journals as well. So maybe that will change a little bit more quickly than other parts of humanities.",

I remember going and talking to the Council for British Archeology about where they should publish data and they were just asking about electronic journals and there were people standing up and saying 'If i publish in your journal that doesn't exist..' because it's electronic.

        "ANSWER": "They are at the point now where even the Institute of Archeology library is taking electronic copies over print ones. So people are getting used to reading electronically because all open access journals have always been electronic so they don't see a distinction there anymore as to whether electronic is quality or not the average researcher. But there is still a lot of problems with unusual publishers popping up. I had an e-mail yesterday from a professor at UCL asking me about a publisher called Herbert on line or something like that asking him to become an editorial board member and so there was a mass e-mail that had gone out, it wasn't personalised in any way. He was one of five thousand people who had received this e-mail probably. People do get these e-mail a lot and that does colour their thinking about it. At the same time we've got people that are absolutely fed up with and so forth. We've had companies like that refusing to allow people to put copies of their papers into the repository and basically being very untruthful about their own policies often a lot of what's legal and what's not. So we have researchers there that are coming to us and saying we want to set up an alternative to this major publishers journal, how do we go about it? We have got things in the works. So there are senior researchers who are just fed up. They are starting to hearing more and more about the big profits the publishers are making and they are looking at what they are getting in return and that's the point where they want to change things.",

        "ANSWER": "Well you are to a degree because those big subscription publishers still have massive print operations. They are trying to shut them down quite quickly, i know one publisher has spent all of this year shutting down it's warehouses all around the world preparing not to be a print publishing book. They still have big costs there and even if your journal is on line only you're still subsidising those big legacy costs. They have big departments full of people managing subscriptions very manually, so you are covering that. But most of what you're paying for, is these journals are highly profitable. You are paying shareholder dividends. These companies are making forty to fifty percent profit and most of that is being paid out in dividends or to acquire other journals. That's not service you are paying for, you're paying to help those companies expand.",

They are not following peer review or anything like that. I think that people have seen the open access model with the article processing charge as a way to make some money. I don't think you could have got subscriptions early on for a journal that was low quality. Someone would say I'm not buying it. There are so many people under so much pressure to publish especially from the developing world who need to publish in the western journals that there is a feeling that you can charge a lot and not actually do the work that you're charging for and because companies like Buy Mid Central and Plos have shown that this is a sustainable model and can actually work they've said OK let's try and exploit it.",

You may not recommend publication but you may tell the person - this is what you need to do to develop the structure of your work and so forth. It's been really helpful for me.",

When you're writing something and publishing it and putting it through that process, what kind of value do you get back not from where your publishing or what it costs but from the actual doing of here's my work, somebody with skills reads it and then gives it back to you. Do you find that helps you learn and improve your work?",

        "ANSWER": "That's a good idea. At Ubiquity we are working a lot on peer review. But it's very subject specific. So in archeology people aren't quite as open to that yet maybe it's another generation of students away. People are still quite concerned about their comments being open and openly available as reviewers. I think for the authors maybe it's not quite as much of a thing. But in other areas like medicine and psychology and so forth it's almost becoming a requirement. So the psychology journals we have, people are asking - can you make things open? So it's very important for the validation process as well not just for improving your work which is critical because i think if you know that the early stages of your work will be available and you know that the comments and the reworking will be available as well then it actually makes you work better right throughout the process and concentrate on the quality and things. The rest of the time i think people are thinking about quickly getting the work out and they will address the reviews comments in a minimal way just to get things done more quickly but if things are open they will actually engage and try produce a more community built project product. So i think in the longer term open review and even open authoring will produce much much higher quality work",

        "ANSWER": "Well with us specifically there have been quite, the things we started doing first of all was publishing in open access in humanities and social sciences. One of the things we did there was we came up with a very low cost model because funds are tighter in humanities and social sciences and people aren't used to having to arrange for their funder to pay in so forth in their institutions. So we came up with as low a cost model as we could and that was successful in humanities so we validated that and that's what we built the whole company on. Even if it's a science journal we charge about 10%of what others do tops. We think it's fair and it makes us sustainable but it also shows them that the money is not being wasted so it also builds trust with the research community that open access is actually probably the fairest way of charging for publishing. So we also make our financial model completely transparent and we publish every line of what an article processing charge goes towards. So that's about trying to change peoples attitudes to open access and that it's not a money making scheme and it's all being done in their interests and then what we started looking was making sure that it's not just the articles themselves being published but it's also the data and software associated with them.So we link up to the institutions repositories and other data repositories through our data journals and we allow people to write a short paper about the data and to gain credit for it that way and so we put a platform of journals across a range of different subjects and we are trying to first of all encourage people in those communities to publish data and also software in the software journal and that's really starting to pick up steam. People are getting the idea and there starting to cite these papers. We had a paper go forward for a ref. for someone who their main output was data they didn't write papers or journal articles so they had to have something that could be refd on the data paper and that's working well. What we are going to start doing is investigating can we help people to search across that platform and start to identify data that they can use for cross disciplinary work and that kind of thing. We are extending that out we are adding access to data repositories say for every single journal a mandatory thing for people who submit, unless they have a good reason they should make that data available as well. That's what we've done we've built a platform where we're starting to integrate data and software publication along side normal articles and the same thing with books basically. What we have really decided is that we don't feel, we got involved because we wanted to encourage open scholarship and we didn't feel a lot of the other publishers were doing that well and we still don't feel that there is much of a change happening among the big legacy publishers. So what we want to do now is we want to accelerate things and we want to re situate as much publishing as possible back to the research community and we want to be a catalyst for that. So what we're doing is we're making our platform available on a re rendered basis to universities to run their own presses and so we have a bunch of universities signing up at the moment. This is something we really only began six months ago and we are going to build a network of university presses running on our infrastructure. So we run the back end for the university and they run the front office, the sales and the interface with the researchers. Bit it de-risks the whole operation of running a university press for them. It makes it very easy to get setup. Everything's being run for them in terms of infrastructure and development and type setting and things like that. So universities like to have the prestige of their own press but they also need an alternative to the big publishers. Right now they have their RCUK funds where they have all this money for open access publishing and it's being siphoned off at an alarming rate by \u00a33,000 per APC. So we want to offer them the ability to create their own publishing operation at 10% of the cost of that and to use those funds more efficiently more in the interests of researchers. So that's kind of the bigger picture that's evolving this year. Which is building this network of university presses which support one another and can start developing more open scholarship based approaches so then each university would have it's own data journal, software journal, they'll share peer reviewers across the universities so the peer review process can run more efficiently and we are looking at things like returning part of the APC to the department of the person who does the peer review. So that the people see that they are being rewarded for what they do and the university is getting some fair value and what we then do is we really start to bring in is university presses from the developing world. I'm working with the university of Nairobi and helping them with their press. We are starting to talk to Chinese universities about whether they can become involved in the network and that then gives them the advantage of running a press to western standards so they get some acknowledgement for the quality of their work and the concerns are addressed about, often people assume that all Chinese workers are either non peer reviewed or plagiarised or so forth which in big universities isn't the case but by operating a western sub press with accreditation they can really address those concerns. They can be involved in a network, it's a way of integrating people in those parts of the world with people publishing in other parts of the world.",

        "ANSWER": "They are a little bit. Overall things like the Finch report and so forth were positive because they were a step in the direction and they involved a mandate which involved saying change is going to happen. The way we work is we are both gold and green. So we are a gold publisher - we charge for what we do but we make things fully open access but we also believe in the green side of things. The archiving side and we automatically archive to repositories. We actually encourage researchers to post their papers and so forth. That side of it to us is kind of a moot thing if you're from an open access publisher you're not going to limit the green side of things so it's more a case of a lot of the people who were on the Finch report or the publishers that were interviewed said - if we charge less than \u00a32,000 we'll go bankrupt. We won't be able to do this. They only interviewed largely legacy publishers and when we later on showed our model to people who had been on the committee they were very surprised. I have shown it to government ministers and so forth and they've said but no-one told me it was possible to do this.",

        "ANSWER": "It's also that, research money is critical to science. We have a limited pool of it and we have to make the best possible use of it and that is in the interest of all of society and if it's being wasted especially for private company profits that's quite scandalous. So part of what we want to do by A having a lower processing charge and B making that transparent is we want to help drive costs down across the industry. So it's not just about us grabbing a big market share and becoming successful it's also about trying to change the way the other companies are working. So hopefully researchers will have a choice on where to publish and they'll be able to make that decision partly based on whether they thing the money is being spent wisely.",

        "ANSWER": "Potentially, I'm not sure. I'm not sure there is a quality issue. I think there's been some misinformation spread by some parties so some of the larger publishers have told their research community that they'll have to stop publishing the journals if things go to open access because they won't be able to sustain the costs which i don't think is correct. That's happened in Humanities a little bit. They've spread misinformation about the licensing and things like that saying if we use open access licensing your work is more likely to be plagiarised and all this sort of thing which isn't true. So some of the quality concerns are being whipped up a little bit by the lobby it's from publishers who know that open access and the APC model is going to happen no matter what but they are trying to stall it as long as they can because they are making big profits in subscriptions. So i think a lot of the concerns about quality are temporary and as more and more of the industry shift across people and younger generations who are convinced by the principles of open access, they won't pay so much attention to that.",

        "ANSWER": "I think if you do that it's in your own interest you must try and publish every research article you've got and if you're publishing study, you need to publish the data, you need to publish the software you've used. You need to make it available and it's not just for validation it's because people will actually take your work and they will expand upon it and you won't just get more citations and so forth but you'll build research connections around the world and you'' become involved in collaborative projects and increase your own career prospects because people have actually taken the data you've used and worked with it. So all the studies showing that you get enhanced, increased interaction if you publish the data as well as the paper. You'll get more readers and so forth. What we're finding with the software is possible there is even more, a greater potential there because people can save a lot of time reusing research software. Once again that leads to more interaction and so forth. So if you're publishing with any publisher you should really insist upon the fact that not just your article comes out with an open license so that you have a proper impact, but that they are willing to take the data and the software as well. Or you archive it somewhere and you insist that they allow you to cite it properly and a lot of publishers at the moment won't take data citations and they won't really, there are issues with it - with even where to cite software on a paper and so forth. I think that in this community we need to develop some standards around how we cite software and data as well. So our approach here has been that we have created data and software journals, where in order to get the paper in the journal you have to archive the software or the data professionally and you link it from the paper so that it's persistently available but then you cite those papers in your other articles or books and they will go straight into the reference list they don't get stripped out or argued about with the publisher. So we have set those up so there is always a place where you can publish the data and software and reference it in other works.",

If they were to come along and need to make that available, what would you say they should do? Should they come to Ubiquity Press with certain types of material or you don't need to focus on your own company if you don't feel comfortable but how would you recommend someone in the younger generation who has some data, some software and they've got some analysis of that that they want to publish as a - here's my article, my story about my research and here's the supporting data, as you described yourself like you have your own supporting data and making that available helps people validate the work.",

So if you work in a university in research stuff where you are possibly classed as a technician although what you actually do is high class research work. You are working on very complicated alga rhythms to process scientific information but the fact that you have X number of Git hub projects and it's been several times over by the projects doesn't really count, doesn't count for the ref and things like that. That's where we've tried to use the journals as a way of saying - well in this case you've got X number of downloads and citations on a paper so it acts as a proxy for what you've done that other people in the research community will understand. It's definitely lacking.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes i think it's critical. Hopefully in the future i think things will start to become merged. Data and so forth will become something you can access directly from a publication more easily. That kind of thing. We don't quite know yet how people are going to interact with the article of the future. It could be that we find ways to cite data more effectively within those articles and so forth. Right now people use reference lists and they use DOI's and that;s the only thing they understand and our ways of measuring impact, the metrics we use all depend in that. I think that for the next three to five years that's what we'll focus on . Beyond that will be very interesting, whether the paper becomes more of a package of things which is published to slightly different platforms to what we see in the journal today. I think that's possible where we're heading but it's a bit of a grey area. We need lots of experimentation in that area. We would love for people to come to us and publish experimental journals which would work like that. So we are starting to do things like include code into our articles and video and things like that. But it's still very much shackled by the traditional model. So the idea of publishing a large research subject that contained everything and could be interrogated in different ways would be interesting.",

It's just that we have to help the university to mitigate a lot of the risks involved with running a company and developing software and so forth. If we can take care of all of the standard publishing part of it and free them up to design it, innovate publications and so forth. Then maybe some really interesting things will come out of it",

I think we're going to see a disruption in the publishing industry. Something is going to flip. Some companies are going to do well from it and some are going to become very disadvantaged but it;s a time where we have a real opportunity to change what happens and the open science community needs to work with publishers who want to change things to really try and take advantage of this. We have a government policy willing to back us up to a large degree, not in every way you possibly want but you knoe while we have that we have to take that window of opportunity and try to change because a lot of the larger publishing companies are trying to stall and trying to hope that that momentum will disppear. We realy have to try and make a difference now",

I do go to a lot of journal articles and try to piece things together that way and that i suppose is where i have noticed more barriers in terms of access",

You know, like Taylor & Francis They do have quite a lot of good journals in cultural studies and critical theory and also conveniently that university has copy write or has access to, where as i think there are quite a lot of other cultural specific journals that we don't have access to. Journals like cultural politics, or others with some really interesting things in that we don't have access to so it does push you out towards some big named ones.

The other thing is sometimes i think that our areas are sometimes quite niche in some ways and so sometimes you really need to find some very specific information about something where there's not a lot written about it yet. I do a lot of stuff in the media, technologies for which i need very up to date information, a lot of people haven't written about it yet and because it's so niche there might only be one of two things that hae been written about that topic from the perspective i need and so obviously when that happens and the only article in some journal that you don't have access to, the that's very frustrating",

If there's a bizarre mess up with the computers,and you only have limited access to it, OK i did it i had a couple of articles that i really needed to get hold of before Christmas and i basically ran out of time to use them because of the weird gate keeping they do on those things and it's really frustrating to try and get in contact with someone who can sort those things out for you as it was a couple more days before i could get access to them again. So that's the first thing i do. The second thing is - there is a repository called ARC.com which is an open access peer to peer sharing network for academics basically. So you can either search there in the repository and see what's there or you can make a request for something and if someones got it you can upload it. Those are the two things i try and do.",

        "ANSWER": "I feel frustrated i think, because the parameters change quite a lot and I'm deeply frustrated with the system because i know it's, obviously certain publishers have got monopolies on certain types of knowledge which i think from a critical theory perspective is very frustrating and that's why i think i wouldn't have qualms about trying to get access to other things. The other thing i might do actually is e-mail the author. So that if it's something that i really want to read, i have done that before, i have e-mailed somebody and they have e-mailed me recently to get something. So obviously it only works if you have some pre existing thing. But it is a nice thing to do as well i think, as people like it when you're interested in their things. I think for me, it's not the same as other forms of copy write - retaining creative control over a film, where the money is going into the film. Where as with the journal articles i don't get the sense, it's almost an anti-benefit to the author.",

There was one thing, the only other things i had published were in an open access context and a short which i hope never sees the light of day, or no-ones read, it was terrible. But i had something recently in a journal, a well known and respected journal in our field so i was really pleased and the peer review process was amazing. I didn't expect it but i got amazing feedback and it was like being part of a knowledge community. It was really helpful and really great and i thought, this is how it should be. This is what peer review should be about. The when it got published it was difficult for people to get access to and it was quite nice because i did get a couple of e-mails from people saying could you e-mail me the article but officially the way i should have done it was, you get a link fro the publisher saying you get 23 downloads and to share the link with your friends. You were supposed to spread this link with your friends so they could read your article and i thought that's cool Then my first horrible thought was - OK that will look good for me in terms of stats and hits to link to my article and then i thought - that's hideous. So I've not shared it with anyone but if someone e-mails me asking for a copy of the article I'll share it with them.",

It's been really helpful exen though it's not nice to be rejected. Some of the feedback has been just as helpful and honed my work in a particular way.

That makes you feel bad, it's not constructive. Unfortunately that can happen in the peer review process. I have had great experiences but i've heard and seen that and some of my colleagues who are well published and well known get that from their work just because their work is valid i think and i think for that to happen in a public forum as a PhD student could be problematic, demoralising and humiliating",

The field i work in is development, there are more open source there are a lot ways in which i can do my work publicly and one of the things I've realised, over time is that i'm very good at doing my work publicly and taking those criticisms, simply due to experience so by default everything we do is visible from the start and that means you have some awful stuff from the start and things you created years ago and look back on and you can see yourself how bad you were at the time as it's visible and so we get used to that and from that certain communities have grown up where you can go to a web site and you can ask questions and people give you feedback on those questions and the kinds of things you're describing where they give you feedback which is really just an attack, you could say - well that's ust a stupid question or rather than answer your question they give you their rebuttal and their preferred answer which doesn't answer your question. Those things become quite well handled because it's public. As long as the majority of the community are of the same opinion, that it's better to be constructive, then the +1 system is basically so that people can't come at you in less useful ways get discounted.

The great thing about technology is that it has the potential to open up the academic community and to be able to put less pressure on a finished product all of the time really encourages that sense of a communal effort that i would aspire to in my academic career",

The field i work in is development, there are more open source there are a lot ways in which i can do my work publicly and one of the things I've realised, over time is that i'm very good at doing my work publicly and taking those criticisms, simply due to experience so by default everything we do is visible from the start and that means you have some awful stuff from the start and things you created years ago and look back on and you can see yourself how bad you were at the time as it's visible and so we get used to that and from that certain communities have grown up where you can go to a web site and you can ask questions and people give you feedback on those questions and the kinds of things you're describing where they give you feedback which is really just an attack, you could say - well that's ust a stupid question or rather than answer your question they give you their rebuttal and their preferred answer which doesn't answer your question. Those things become quite well handled because it's public. As long as the majority of the community are of the same opinion, that it's better to be constructive, then the +1 system is basically so that people can't come at you in less useful ways get discounted.

        "ANSWER": "There are things we are doing at the centre that i think are nice. For example, Josh and i have placed the blogs up and I've re-read the blog and I've thought it's not very good but because we have a nice community, i have ended up chatting with other people about the article who have read it and i think you had left a comment and think about stuff in a different way. So i think its useful in terms of having informal spaces and creating a culture around that as a good testing round for ideas and things",

It's the opportunity to present questions that you are still struggling with and for people to engage with those. Actually because it's informal I'd actually be more thorough in my enquiries",

With a blog would you automatically assume that it's not serious work or would it be serious and would your comments in that forum be different if you were asked to review the work in a different forum?",

If you just reference fragments of things, then you know, but often those fragments build on stuff that's already out there. So for example the blog about the horse meat scandal, there's been that one thing that's been written about that in a journal because that's quite recent. There have been some reviews written about the text it's referring to and so piecing those things together even though they are not the most formal published journal articles. If i was writing a more formal article about horse meat I'd maybe use that to say well this has been touched on by these people but i am going to elaborate on these ideas and build on them",

It would require that academic rigour.

If you are somewhere and engaging with that work at an early stage and you're the idea of finality to a piece of research, For both of you, what do you think would answer that question, what makes that work final, who would be involved? Let's say you'd published, would you feel comfortable say referencing a link to Eva's blog, would you feel comfortable knowing someone had done that or would you prefer that Eva had it in a journal?",

It doesn't necessarily guarantee it, especially if it's from a different disciplinary perspective. They might be just working through ideas that have happened elsewhere at different points. I think it's to do with what you bring to it as well and how you interpret things",

I think it will be something i can do in a few years time but just in terms of having to jump through hoops for my career, i have to do journals, peer reviewed, pay for access stuff, books released through various standard publishers.

It's like you have to do things that you don't necessarily want to do because that's what's recognised currently Although there are major shifts now where everything is moving towards open access models in the UK. I think some of my friends have been involved in stuff like Caroline Edwards that's an ex-student here. She's been involved with work to do with open access models for humanities that are like the +1 model and things like that. So i think there is a push on one level for open access for the broader scale, sort of governmental shifts which i don't know if that's going to be enacted so it's mutually beneficial to everybody. I don't know if the motivations are geared towards the genuine production of knowledge. On the other hand, our discipline is quite political and i know that Colin's work, he was keen to have it downloaded for free on open access because of political commitments and i think that within our discipline there is that desire to try and make things freely available. It's just difficult for researchers to do that at the moment. I think it is changing though, slowly",

Even in terms of publishers there's hierarchy of which publishers are the best to publish in. A lot of academics don't know about and those that do know these things have generally got an insight. I think it's partly tradition and partly this push to be able to qualify for things, to quantify knowledge. If it's peer reviewed then that can be quantified on a good piece of work. I think it's those two and that it's a cultural thing.",

        "ANSWER": "Sure. I guess for me other than the broad sweeping arguments of, you can hear my accent I'm American so even though i have British citizenship and I'm applying for Australian citizenship. I've always been very sensitive to the fact that in spending tax payer money whether it be in the US, UK or Australia, that's what you're doing right and it's scary to look at someone who pays taxes and say - i'm spending your money and yet i don't have the same accent as you or the same ideals of user patriotism as you. That type of thing, so that's always mattered to me, to be defending that at a very real level. Now that's nice as a broad sweeping argument, but the moment you get into the long tailed discussion of kind of opening up something like bio-medical data or something and you get into a conversation about anonomizing it or de-identifying it, there's a very long tailed discussion that has to occur in each one of the different disciplines and all the rest of it. For better or worse i feel that it does basically improve the rate and the speed of which scholarship occurs. If you can get the problems out of the way, if we can come up with a good de-identification or way of anonymizing the data, or tools or whatever, in a way that it can be made open then i actually feel that what that will do for researchers is that it will get them more research funding and save them time. So it comes down to a very real thing where researchers actually can say - because i opened up my data and put in that extra effort to anonymize it and now it's out there in the open, then said researcher across the country, the globe and I've seen this, I've friends, i'm much more closer to. People talk about international like they know what it it is, I've seen it. I've got a meta researcher in Oxford who's worked with a researcher in Melbourne who I've then connected to a researcher, you know who's in Sandeago and that's very real. It's a very small group but then they do really amazing and cool things. Most of the time it's the data, the tools, the method or the publication that's enabled them to participate and do things with that. So it isn't even about open. The word i use more than anything else is collaborative. Open enables collaboration. Open is not a means to an end, collaboration is where we want to get researchers doing things and that involves all the problems of human psychology, of trust, of relationships and all the rest of it. But open is at least one pillar inside it being able to accelerate that place where we can collaborate that.",

        "ANSWER": "Sure. I guess the communities I've experienced, and the reason i'm so. I want other people to see the open source community and the developers community. It's the community to me that exemplifies or typifies what can be achieved when people start to work in the open and allow things to be shared quickly and all the rest of it. I mean, the Linux community, the MIAS QL community. My problem with my first experience with openness war round my MIAS QL. This massive database could be used anywhere, i could write in MIAS QL. I was a database developer in a very previous life and as a young person out of under grad who was doing database management that would have been my first experience and then you tend to look up and outside it wasn't just MIAS QL there was all these other things happening. My career has actually allotted to 15 years of for being a database developer. You just realise how amazing it is with all the opens that are out there. I love open hardware right now, reprinting and sharing all of that stuff is amazing but there is another hundred of those opens that all provide that same thing. All that by opening up what they're doing, they create more collaboration and they do what humans want to do which is socialise, share things, trust one another to produce better things that actually we can't do as individuals anymore and we have to do it in group scenarios in group things.",

        "ANSWER": "So i think the thing that I'm most passionate about and care about right now is the research cloud and so we're using a piece of technology called Open Stac which is a bit like Amazon web services. But the cool thing about it is again isn't the technology, it's the fact that it allows us to openly share things. One of my favourite examples is what i call the ball of clay example, which is, normally people have got Tab software, 3-D software and the problem with that is that you're doing it by yourself. It's like you standing over a ball of clay and doing the whole thing together so it's cut scene and now imagine ghost and there's a ball of clay between the two of us. Being able to both put our hands on that and form it together, that's the amazing possibility of collaboration. So it took an open piece of technology to enable that, researcher doesn't even know it's called open stac, they ust know that they now have this share of a piece of software that they're using sitting on the cloud and it enables them to be both looking at this thing with one another and it's interesting as open stac is now open, but the software we're using isn't necessarily open. But it's enough open that it's enabled the collaboration in the community and that's what's exciting, because once you have two people using that, all of a sudden the ability to scale out and bring more and more people into the all of clay problem and that's what's cool. Unlike the physical enironment wher you can only maybe fit six hands on the ball of clay, in the digital space there is an upward number.",

        "ANSWER": "It literally is the opportunity to collaborate. The whole point is that researchers feel alone and isolated in using their tools. I mean we did a tool audit of researchers at the Uni of Melbourne and we think, it's a very broad structure, back of a napkin time numbers right. Each department, five or six research tools, N number of departments times N number of international collaborations, subdivided by some core tools that people use. So we think it's like two hundred to five hundred tools sit on any given research canvas. Which isn't all that shocking really, i think that's pretty normal. But the point of that is that you do feel really alone in these tools. So a linguist doing tree maps will have these really niche bits of software which are really cool and powerful for them but they are actually quite old and one of the most difficult things is that they eventually get the thing up and working but then you're like well how do i do this? So the ability to turn around and ask somebody how to do that is really powerful and the other interesting side to that coin is, this is something I'm very passionate about, is you're never going to provide a help desk for that. That's one of the problems. IT, the traditional solution has been - here is a tool, let's provide a help desk. Hi i'm the researcher, I'm working on Indonesian languages from the sixth period such and such and i want to produce a tree diagram which works with this language and bridges to this language. That's impossible, We are never going to get a help desk for that type of thing. The only solution in this is community and collaboration, ergo back to my original point. If you don't have open, that's the other point, it enables more open. The diconomy of us buying a bunch of software to make it open. So we buy a site license that now allows us to use a piece of software so that it feels open to everybody on the campus. But the sad part is that that is kind of limiting because what we actually want to do is to make sure that our researcher working with the African researcher, with the Indian researcher or the Chinese researcher also has access to that tool and all of a sudden we are getting problems when in fact, they would much rather Skye their colleagues in Indian than necessarily turn around and ask someone round the corner?",

So what is it that you think is helping you to engage with researchers then to bring them into that, what particular aspect is it that makes them get engaged with what you're providing? Makes them change their mind or join this collaboration?",

        "ANSWER": "That's my obsession. Community building is everything for me because it's not a science, it's definitely an art. It would depend on which discipline as well. For example the linguist. We have been working with them to produce a mapping application so that you can imagine all the languages, all the different aboriginal languages across Australia and how those overlap and their relationship on a big map. So we have been using a nice piece of software called all open source on the open sector. People can use it with one another. Thus far the way we've been doing that is, again this goes back to the developer community giving them a list serve, giving them some tags to be able to talk about on whether that's Google plus, twitter or face book and then encouraging face to face. So we do have a really big advantage i that we are on a campus in the Uni of Melbourne. We are not distributed. So for us the technology tools - list ser, the twitter, all of that is actually a function of getting people together face to face because again it's hierarchy right. You get open, I've got to get trust and you're not usually going to get trust by someone tweeting one or another. So usually the fastest way to get trust is to have a face to face conversation and then all of a sudden the tools start to enable this collaboration. But we've got to build trust and i'm not saying you can't do trustified tools and e-mails or something or maybe Skye or whatever. But for me the fastest way we have always been able to achieve that is by face to face. Get the people together, get the linguist talking with other art historians. They all of a sudden are willing to e-mail each other and trust and it's not necessarily like the list serve right, they would rather e-mail me and then have a quite conversation on the side than put it out on the list serve. Researchers are inherently private people.",

        "ANSWER": "Well, that's interesting. I don't know if we've gone that far yet. I think over the next eighteen months I'll be able to answer that question. What we're trying is really new. I mean most IT departments in universities are very very comfortable with help desks now and to propose that instead you are going to you this hippie free wheeling mechanism to do self supporting networks, it feels more like alcoholics anonymous than it feels like an official enterprise IT support department and yet I'm open for other discussions. Although saying that, what i do find interesting is that the open technology allows us to carry that on. One of the cool things is that by utilising the cloud and by utilising open stac, means that when a researcher comes along and uses a tool, at least that tool is still there. So there is a chance for further collaborations to occur beyond the life of the one person using it. In the old days it would have been - I've uploaded the tool, i have a ton of mail on my desk top my laptop either gets tossed or out the window. So we've then lost that persons project, their tool and most importantly we've lost the persons knowledge. I can't say the persons knowledge, they've moved on and that's the whole goal. But if we can save their tool and their data and get them to sign off on something at the end of their time here with us saying - i don't mind if you keep this data and this tool. That's a lot easier than us going and saying - can i have the stuff off your laptop. If it's already sitting in out network, secure and controlled but then we later go along and say, hey we've got this tool and another post graduate wants to use your tool that you built or the modifications then we're hoping that's the outcome. But again, ask me in eighteen months and I'll have a better idea.",

What happens beyond those, when those are finished and people come to compete the work they've used these systems to build, are they quite happy and comfortable, are all their issued solved or does this new collaborative working style bring up more problems that you have to deal with when it comes to completing a piece of work?",

        "ANSWER": "To tell you the truth I'm fairly optimistic about it. Just because i have built ambassador champion programmes before so i know what it means to have to get your ambassadors and champions and incentivize them, how to deal with the fact that when you loose them, how to role out new ones and all the rest of it. Community building i am pretty comfortable with. What will be really interesting is how well we can do with, the best part is Post Graduates are absolutely the best group of people you can have for ambassadors and champions - incredibly smart, not a lot of money so motivating them isn't incredibly hard, really altruistic. Most post graduates inertly care about and are open right and into doing things new. They're not like old professors and there's a lot of them. In the university of Melbourne there's twenty five thousand of them who have taught and researched there so i think we have a really large pool of people and basically for some pizza money and maybe sending them to a conference every now and again. I've got myself, for the cost of one salary member, i reckon i could have twenty five post graduate champions each representing the different areas for the same cost. It's maybe me playing a little bit fast and loose but why not utilise volunteer organisational structures where this is borrowed from. Me understanding the national society and they way to do community building with the open knowledge foundation. Those skills all come together and we are utilising just a different structure than the help desk. We are utilising the community structure and it's a valid structure. It really does work and most importantly if you don't believe me go and look in any of thee big open source communities. They scale to potentially millions. So in theory it should be easy.",

        "ANSWER": "The main dilemma, is my worry - i think we're in a place of, there's the typical model of storming, forming, norming and over the past ten years i think we've been in the state of storming. There have been all these tools created for researchers to do different things but now we're starting to have the forming stage where finally people are starting to centre around certain very specific tools and it's tools like map lab and R stat and svss and stata and excel obviously. But there are starting to become some coalescence inside of these. Now what i find really interesting, is that the cats software we're using is going to become really core research software that people use. My question is will that be, and I'm back and forth on that a lot, like i said, what i care about is not that the tools open. I care that it has the largest possibility to have the largest community group because i can't support that tool myself. I can't have a help desk. I need that community whether that be the university of Melbourne community or even better a world wide community to say - we all support R stat as a statistical programming tool to be able to do all of our graphs inside of our research papers. My worry with that is that, R stat is great because it is a world wide community where as something like map lab costs a lot of money to do. So it's very privileged and university of Melbourne is the number one research uni in Australia and obviously can afford that and it needs a lot of money to do those things. We have a very large budget for buying research tools but i don't know that that's the best thing for research as a whole and Australia know this. The number of Chinese universities coming on line and even coming into the top one hundred universities. Even Africa's going up. Those groups could disruptabley innovate the whole thing and switch the thing around because they will be using a different tool and they will be over here. So i really believe it's important that we have to figure out a way to keep people in open tools and again, it's not because it's open it's because my researchers will have the best opportunities to find people to trust and collaborate with around the world because again, research is niche. It's really difficult to find someone who does know the Latin for this period and this region. There are only going to be two or three other people on the planet legitimately and if that persons using R Stat and the other persons using Map Lab they won't work with one another. They might have a conversation but the moment they have a tool they can work with one another, they are solving a problem with one another and that's what brings people together and that's what builds trust. It needs to be a shared tool and so some disciplines might decide that mathmatica is the tool that all mathematicians need to use and fair enough. As long as that's defacto.",

        "ANSWER": "I think that's the most important tool of all. Basically the process of writing things with one another is essential and so word is crap for that. Anyone who has ever passed around revisions and I'm talking pure features whether it's open or closed. But the problem with word is that it's legitimately a bad technology for collaborating because passing reviews around means they are all out of sync and somebodies got to bring them back together. I really love google docs. If i said a preference right now, i would say google docs. For the most part at least it's free to use so there's not a barrier there, people can collaborate. But again the problem with Google docs is that it can lead to imbed the science and the data inside of it. You can do it to some degree and this is the point - once you start to collaborate and write a document with one another that's one thing. It's another thing once you start to do experiments and you need to pull the experiments inside of the research to do that. You have your experiment there and them most importantly once your experiments inside of that, what do you do? You then go out to your peer review and you get critiques about why everything is wrong. So then you're in a place again, just like the word document with reviews and it's oh shit we have to change all the graphs in this paper so that they line up with all the formulas along with all the tables and actually google docs. starts to fail there as well and then you move onto the next step. This is what i find really interesting is again back to the developer community, the developers are the ones who are dealing in this ultra collaborative space. They've invented tools like Latex and Mark Down and that's what i would see as the future as they are being able to write something and collaborate on it all at the same time like google docs. and then have peer review come in to it. Look at the data, change it. allow errors and ultimate revisions and then have versions all the way back. From inception of one author, to six authors writing it together to the editorials looking at it, to peer review giving comments back to it, to re-editing it. Thats' the whole chain that needs to be there. Not that any one's going to look at it but it should be there.",

Explaining how you want to focus on tools out there and how having those tools openly available for the bigger community and you also mentioned that people will obviously publish their research when they are finished. So publication of research in itself is a tool, for communicating information.

They are the people i want to read the paper. So i will pretend in a way, that i am giving them exclusive access as you as an expert need to read this. I'm not doing it I'm actually hand delivering it. My editorial process is handing it to the main people i want to read the thing. The publication process where i hand it out and give it to the world it's kind of a long tail argument where i don't really care because my beta reviewers, my peer reviewers were actually the group that i wanted to read this thing. The rest of the world, i don't really care. It's the group of people that participated in that. So it's non consequential whether or not it does need to be opened up. It does need to be opened up because I'm invited to go and speak at conferences afterwards because people find that on the web and that's great for me because it brings up the next research. It's not publish, it's ........",

        "ANSWER": "I eat my own dog food on this stuff. That's the nice thing about advocating this, is it's valuable to write research type stuff papers and there's a lot to be said for the scholarly method. How you put things through peer review. There's value in having things published and hyping things up more. I don't really know, I've never really published in nature and what happens when you have one hundred thousand people ask you a question because you have invented an idea. I have no idea about that. But what i do know, as a minor researcher in my own field is that it's a lot more advantageous for me to be out there than in some little shitty journal that i think people don't care about. The nice bit, again going back to the post graduates, that's what the post graduates are - post graduates are early career researchers. That are learning to do it that way and the whole point is that these post graduate researchers aren't going to be an Einstein or a Dawkins. It's just not going to happen. They're going to be minor researchers their entire life and they are going to have to fight and struggle to get research publications and frankly having a blog and pushing your ideas out there and doing revisions openly and utilising these tool chains. That gives you what is seen as being busy in the space, which builds up trust which gives you the next research grant. So we suffer in academia extremely about fame. Secretly, and they won't tell you this, most post graduates, and they should have this dream, in the same way that the entrepreneur thinks that they are going to be the next Bill Gates or the next Zuckerburg. Most researchers think - I'm secretly going to be the next Einstein. You're not, statistically you're not. You know this and you should know better than most because you actually have the mathematical skills but that's the point. It's actually about a better way of working if you want to get more money and do what you want to do. Working in the open makes you seem valuable to the community because you seem busy in the open.",

I think tools and data are two sides of the same coin. You can't have one without the other but even the conference we're at now is about open data. I guess i understand that because it's the next vogue thing to do, but i do question about how well data enables trust and collaboration. Again it's a step ways on the way to that but I'm a believer that a problem is the best thing for a researcher to centre around. I'd be interested to know how well, is data a problem, is it a good thing for people to think about?",

        "QUESTION": "Of the researchers I've talked to so far. Data does quite often come up as a problem. It's not an exciting problem or one that really needs solved its just a boring problem that gets in the way. Like the person who needs to travel two thousand miles to a research site to set up equipment to collect some data, has to travel two thousand miles and that's a boring problem. But they do it - teleportation doesn't exist so that's how it's done. In the same way, collecting that data back so that they can research with it and use that information to have a collaboration and to share is still a boring problem and quite often involves managing old devices and recording stuff on paper and then fixing the errors that in terms of new equipment, on line web technology haven't been a problem for quite some time and so i think there is an issue there where the researchers would like to be able to do a lot more with the data than they can.",

Open tools i really care about as it enables collaboration and it actually provides the most exciting moments for me. I just had a moment where i was looking at a new tool and i was like holy shit, that's awesome and you mean it. That's cool that's brilliant. It's those moments that i get to look at a spreadsheet and think, i mean when you visualise the spreadsheet you do something cool with it you can have that moment. I find it interesting with regards to open scholarship and the rest of it. What are the things that actually can inspire us to engage researchers i what we're dealing with? I guess for me right now, I'm of the argument that that's tool but I'm willing to be convinces otherwise.",

        "QUESTION": "and that problem hasn't been solved for them and they haven't solved the problem for themselves because it's not an exciting, it's not there own field of research. I think data is probably a good thing to hear that people are talking about. Coming up with new ways to be able to share and work on that data, But it's an infrastructure problem. It should ust be easy, in the same way that we can get the electricity we should be able to get the data and then as you're saying that the more options people come up with to access the data. As a researcher in a particular field, you're trained with particular skills, particular methods that you follow. One of the reasons why you can work with a another researcher in a similar field is that no matter where they are in the world, they are probably trained in the same skills and methods but yet they are not when it comes to the tools they use. Tools does seem to be about what was available at that time, which it has to always be to a certain extent. I think the usage of tools needs to be something which goes along side the skills you need to have and the methods you follow for your research and this is the tool you use. Very large organised groups of scientists say that are working on very particular problems like physics, LHC here in Geneva. Their problems are solved for them cause really there's only one way to do it. You need one huge giant tool that everyone works on. Similarly for astronomy their data sets are so large that they do all work together and they do all have that kind of community. But doing that same thing for smaller groups i think is hard but as you've been describing, beneficial.",

So my aim is to have a decent outcome from the project that would lead forward to that and i was keeping an open mind about whether i would continue in academia or not at that point.

        "ANSWER": "Well we are trying to control mosquito populations because a small proportion of mosquito species transmit human disease. Which in the case of Malaria for instance, is one of the worlds biggest killers. The mosquito's that i work on transmit virus which is one of the most prevalent viruses. It doesn't kill as many people as Malaria does, but it does put a lot of people at risk and there are millions of infections every year which will give people two or three weeks off work and it's very unpleasant. There is no cure, there is no vaccine. So our only methods at the moment of controlling the spread of that disease is based on mosquito's and so that's why it's important to find new methods particularly as our use chemicals but mosquito's develop resistance to those and have been doing for quite a long time. So we are looking for biological methods of control. In my case either using bacteria that infects mosquito's and is transmitted mother to daughter and then my second placement will be working on making mosquito's genetically sterile. So that you can at least repress the population that way. So there's a double approach. Population placement, so this bacteria method produces mosquito's that can't transmit the deadly virus and the idea is to replace the natural population with bacterial infected mosquito's. Or there is population suppression which is reducing the absolute numbers by using the sterile effects. So that's the idea.",

        "ANSWER": "So a mixture of things. Some techniques have been passed from post docs to me. Both written and in terms of demonstrated to me. Especially specialist techniques for this this lab. So we do mosquito micro injections which uses a specialist bit of kit which not every lab would have. Some of the more basic stuff i picked up during practicals as an undergraduate and kind of doing research projects as part of my earlier degree. Obviously in practicals it is demonstrated to you as part of the undergraduate learning process and again demonstrations, the kind of written instructions handed out during research projects. But there have been quite a few occasions where I've been using methods or tests that no-one in the lab has done before. So in that case i get my information from the published literature. Usually as my first port of call because i realise that anyone in the lab group who has done an essay or realise i want to do an essay will find it. But that then generally doesn't contain enough information for me to actually do the essay so beyond that, if it's a manufacturers kit, I'll get the manufacturers instructions. If it isn't a kit, I'll just try and dig back through the literature to try and find the original methods paper or at least the first paper to use that method as that tends to be a lot more detailed than later written out instructions. That's basically the way it goes. But i do find that if I'm doing that it will never work the first time or probably the second time because there's always something that you just don't know learn without doing it and realising that you need to put in another step or that for your samples this isn't going to work. So it's a mixture of for certain techniques there will be someone there who knows and will pass it on or there are very clear and detailed written instructions that is usually shared just between the lab. Although i have downloaded lab protocols from other labs. Which are non published just stuff that they share on their websites. Which are very helpful as they are very minutely detailed and then beyond that it's digging back into the literature. Often having to read many papers just to try and piece together steps that another paper left out and then cross referencing that to the manufacturers instructions. So it's a mixture.",

        "QUESTION": "So now we have an idea of what you do and why you're doing it. Could we talk about, i guess there is a history ocurrent and a future type approach to this. When you were doing your under graduate and moving to the position you're in now, how did you learn the kind of things you know now? For example, you've already today demonstrated that you can work in the lab and do various kind of tests and so on. You mentioned a bit earlier about following particular instructions sets for doing a test and then putting that through. So where did you get that information from?",

        "ANSWER": "Yes, it's usually a mixture. I don't really mind where it comes from as long as it's detailed enough that i can try and do it myself. But often it will be a case of mashing things together because you'll often be using different kinds of samples to, they might have done it in a cell line and you'll have to get a whole mosquito and you'll have to go back and think well how can i do this. Often you'll just have make some of it up and hope that it works. So there is an element of not being able to find it but i do try and get as much covered as possible. But for journal articles, they do tend to miss out quite a lot of crucial information. For instance, solvents. I had about ten tabs open with different journal articles trying to find out what they dissolved this compound in which i knew couldn't be dissolved in water, at the concentration they said they had used it at but no where did they say that they had dissolved in this DMSO which is the solvent i found out about on the tenth or eleventh paper that they specifically said. Which is unfortunate because you don't know that they have properly controlled by just putting the solvent in the other cell lines that weren't treated. So there's a lot of that, the small details that i guess because it;s their research community they feel don't need to be stated and that everyone should know that your solvent is DMSO. But i do find that if you're going outside your own local research community which in our research community we do a lot because a lot of the effects of the bacteria we study have only really been discovered in the last, well since 2008. So a lot of the time the stuff that you're wanting to apply to the problems that we have are not native techniques to this particular research area and you have to delve into other areas where i definitely think there is an assumed knowledge that i don't have, and no-one else in the lab has so yes you do end up with those sorts of situations.",

        "ANSWER": "I think in that case because so many papers hadn't mentioned it that that was just the assumption that everyone must know that you put this stuff in because in that particular research community i think it's a pretty standardry agent. So they just assumed everyone knew. There were other cases where I've tried to replicate something and I've realise that they've not written about an entire centrifugation step and then i have thought - it's quite a big thing to leave out. I'm not sure that that was deliberate. I'm not sure that it was trying to not allow other people to replicate it but they certainly must have realised that it would make it a lot harder to replicate if they didn't write down that they had done that in the interim. Especially when you are using expensive regents and you are using consumables. It's really frustrating because then you realise you've got it all written down from the method in the paper and then you realise that you have got two steps ahead of yourself because there was clearly something you should have done in the middle and now you've blocked all your filters and now there's nothing you can do so yes i think there are definitely times but it's difficult to check to know the intention in what people are writing.",

So i would never usually find, unless it was literally the only one that i could find for a certain procedure. But i don't tend to do procedures that are that unusual. I would generally check several from different websites all Molecular biology forums which takes a while but i don't like printing something off and just hoping that it will work without checking that it's roughly in line with what other people that are doing those things.",

Sometimes it's written on a web page in which case i will usually copy it into a word document with the URL just so that it's there and then I'll usually re-write it for my own purposes and then put where i got it from in my own version as well. We have written lab books so i will try and print a copy and paste the version that i used into the lab book and then handwrite as I'm going along any changes i make and then update the version on the computer. I don't really have any versions at all which I'm trying to work out a better way of doing that at the moment because I've got a few protocols that do change quite a bit and that I'm still optimising. Currently I'm just updating the master document but i did think it would be useful, and i have the old copies in the lab books, but i wouldn't like to implement having a version that I've updated on a date time thing record on a computer as i haven't. It's sitting down to work out what tools to use and then working out how to use it. Hasn't quite happened yet but that is something that I've been thinking about. It's that they do change and there's a lot of your particular set up that you need to add in usually once you need to tweak it.",

        "ANSWER": "The labs books function is that it will remain the property of the university and my supervisor should they need to look something up when i have gone. That's just they way my research group works. I personally don't find it the most useful way of recording information but i know through colleagues and speaking to other group leaders that also rely on written books that essentially if they have a member of staff that leaves and they perhaps have a paper that needs completing they will go back through the written document and expect a cross reference to digital files but it just gives you a chronological account of what you've done and there is stuff you can just scribble down stuff or calculations as you go along to work. I would say that despite doing this for over two years, my way of using the lab book has changed quite a lot over those two years and i still don't think that the way I'm using it is the best way because it's difficult to have a mixture of stuff on the computer and in a lab book and attempt to make them gel nicely or completely cross reference. So i do find it a bit annoying. I would personally prefer to have an academic lab notebook system which i guess at the end of the day you could sit down and print out a copy and have a hard copy and stick it in a folder but that is not currently something that is here. I've looked through our systems and there's nothing that would work without massive amounts of money being spent that i can find. So that's the way it works. Just as a record essentially. I mean i do use it myself just to flick back and see what i have done in terms of protocols but i would do the same thing if i had an electronic version as a reference.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes, Which they never do. However they do in some groups. Which is why it's kind of difficult. I know that when i move to my industrial placement, there it would be expected that everything is written down as it's done and signed off on that day by multiple people because then it has IP implications as to at what point you made that discovery and all the rest of it. Where as here it is more of a kind of contemporary account of what you were doing at times so that when you look back you can see or jot down in a chronological order what was happening. I think is the general idea and the superior thing i think happens really mostly, from the labs and groups i know, it's more that they would like them when you've gone. So that if anything needs checking then you'e unlikely to remember if you've moved onto your next placement. But they can flick through. I've looked through some peoples lab books that were previously in the lab to work out if a random pair of primers I've found in a freezer work.",

But i guess the idea is that you have your evidence somewhere and anyone at some point could come and check and ensure that what you have published is correctly documented in the lab book as well. But I'd argue that a lot of the output, i definitely use it for things like PCR picture print outs and images and stuff like that but the majority of my digital numerical data that comes off the QPCR machine, that kind of thing is mostly on the computer and I'll write it in the book.",

At the moment i would say that because no-one checks the lab book on a regular basis, what tends to happen is that i will write day to day notes in a notebook and then construct something a little bit more legible in the lab book. Perhaps at the end of a couple of days when I've got stuff together. But once it's in that book i would be happy for people to look at it.",

So i guess i would foresee anything extra going in as supplementary materials and more detailed methods if necessary. If it won't fit in the paper word count. Which is quite handy, i see a few labs doing that. They'll just put everything as a supplementary file that won't fit in and then and at least it's available. I guess most of the, in terms of methodology stuff works quite nicely. In terms of the data, the output is usually a graph. For instance a lot of my work is on gene expression. In which case it will just be a graph of gene expression or relative gene expression in certain samples. The standard way of publishing more data from that is just to have essentially a wall data file of the QPCR and output. But it's rarer for people to do that because the values in the graph are mostly what people want. But luckily at QPCR there are standards by which you should publish and there is minimum information for QPCR experiments so I've just got a checklist that i would have to just go through and it tells you what exactly you need to put in the methodology, what information is necessary there and all of the information and data you should publish for that experiment to make it as complete as possible. That is a standard set by the community. So I'd use that for that data and just make sure that it is adheres to it and other stuff i think would just be a judgement call as to what needs to be published in terms of backing up what I'm saying and what is just back ground data almost or stuff that in the lead up, some of the data is just to verify bits before i do the experiment and people aren't that interested in checking, like the stuff I'm doing today is mostly to check that before i do an experiment i know exactly what materials I'm using. But when i write in the paper that I'm using that, people will assume that i have checked that. Where there are community standards i will follow those check lists and where not, just decide.",

        "ANSWER": "Hopefully, what isn't published in a paper would go in a thesis and anything that isn't published in a thesis that would be of interest to someone, i would attempt to put some where that you can share that you can put in small data sets. I intend to what I've collected that isn't rubbish - it's worked. There's not much that i have got so far that didn't work or has been scrapped for various reasons that generated data that would be useful to anyone else. Most of them are pilot experiments or trying out things that don't quite get there so they are more, i don't currently have any data that is outside the topics the thesis that i would consider verified enough to go in extra repository or some kind of data catalogue. The detailed protocols would be in the thesis which should be open access as soon as i can the well, the issue i have is because of my industrial replacement at least the portion or the piece that is thesis related has to go in embargo due to the company wanting to make sure there are no IP commercial interest issues in that section. I haven't yet got agreements that i can release that agreement in the contract applies in all places, but I've yet to negotiate but I'm pretty sure that anything i do here which is the majority of my work is not of interest to them. So they shouldn't have a problem with me putting it out there. So in that case everything will hopefully be there and available. I would probably avoid putting anything, we don't really have a lab site as such so there is no where i could put it. It's locally hosted and i don't think that's particularly useful due to people moving around. So if it's not in the thesis or in a paper or in an open access repository it's probably not worth having. That's what i hope, when i see all of the stuff that I've done, i am hoping that will be the split but we'll see how that goes.",

        "ANSWER": "I think I'm putting all this effort in to doing the work. I'd rather that people benefited from it as much as possible. The work that I'm doing here doesn't have any commercial value as such. I'm not expecting to make any money out of it and i don't think anyone else really is. So it's more about furthering knowledge and letting people do what they want with it. That's why I'd rather that it was available if people want to look at it. As I've had to adapt a few protocols for work in this field and this is a growing field that is quite young, hopefully it would be of interest to people that want to investigate similar questions in their systems. So i think it's viable to make, certainly more detailed information perhaps, as much as possible available. So anything that i publish during my time with the company as a paper will almost certainly be open access because they do tend to publish in open access journals. Partially because they work with genetically modified organisms and therefore there is a PR angle of not wanting to appear like you're hiding stuff. The majority of their output currently is in open access journals. Their biggies are Plos 1 for instance. So I'm pretty confident that anything that was going to go public from that project would be open access anyway. Which is great and i don't think there would be any problem with that at all. It's more that prior to the publication they wouldn't want it, just in case it has to get written up in a patent. So i don't particularly think, under the current IP system that just has to be the way it is for most companies. So i don't particularly have a problem with the work that I'm do for the company being under embargo until such time as they manage to write a related patent and get the patent out, that's fine by me. I would have a problem i think if they were very strong about the rest of my thesis not being available. The official embargo for the company is five years which i think is a long time, i suppose it takes a while to get things pateneted but if they were insistent that the rest of my work was embargoed for the next five years, i wouldn't be happy with that, but that's a negotiation we have yet to have. I am fairly confident that because they are generally open access and that my work here has almost zero impact on their commercial interests that that would be an issue. Here it's fine. My supervisor is sponsored by Welcome Trust so we have to publish everything open access anyway so that's not a problem.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes. I am working on a mosquito called which has a naturally occurring infection with who's genome was recently sequenced and published as such. The publication said that the annotated, fully formed version of the genome was available on ricroscope which is a microbial genol site which is wasn't when i checked it was still listed as a private project and you needed a password to enter. So after three e-mails i was promised access from the author. I was promised access after i first e-mailed the person and nothing happened. Then i followed it up with two more e-mails and still nothing happened. As far as I'm aware and i haven't checked in a month it's still listed as a private project despite the fact that it's been published in a journal as available on their site which i don't think is very fair. But i basically gave up as they have put the raw sequence on the NCBI general bank website. For my purposes i didn't really need the fully annotated genome. I just needed the raw sequence and i can work with that. But it still means that had i wanted to do anything a bit more complicated then it would have been handy to have the already analysed version. I didn't think it was correct to publish something as available when it wasn't. So i have come across that. I have come across stuff not so much not published but not published in anyway that makes it easy to copy and re-use it as well. Just tables and images of DNA sequencing things that you have to sit down and type out manually as well which is quite annoying. I think that is probably my main, the genome is probably the main one i have come across where actually i haven't been able to access information despite going through the proper channels and theoretically i shouldn't have to go through any channels as it should be there. I can't think of any major ones. Most journals i use information from, we subscribe to if they are pay for access so that's not been too much of a problem. Although I'm at a very rich university.",

I would say that the majority is still subscription but because a lot of the stuff I'm reading is biomedical, I'm seeing more stuff coming out of the Plos journals. A lot of major work in our field comes from Plos pathogens or Plos NTDS so they are prestigious journals in our area. Particularly Plos pathogens. I'm seeing quite a bit more stuff coming out of Plos 1 as well, smaller papers from larger groups that would ordinarily publish their bigger stuff in say PNAS or Science and Nature but also seem to be publishing in Plos 1. I think there is growing open access. It is difficult to tell as i usually get a lot of my, I'll keep an eye on the publications in my field usually using Pubmed so you don't pay much attention when you click full text if it's going through to a free page or going through to open access but I'd say probably less than half but only just open access in this field.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes i think so. People are out looking for this bacteria in various mosquito populations where we're not sure yet that it exists and a lot of the work is coming out of developing countries. I think in this research field it is definitely a benefit for people - researchers and members of the public as well. At the moment we are still very much, certainly with the species of mosquito's that we use very much on the basic mechanistic science, at least that's what i work on. Although it contributes to, it's quite far removed from the ultimate applied purpose so i think my particular work probably won't be of much use to say, it's probably not going to form policy or anything like that as such. It should be of interest to other researchers out there who are looking for these interactions and their could be common effects in different species of bacteria and their combinations. So i do feel that they should be able to access it as well as other people at rich universities in Europe or America. I think there are other groups that are currently at the field release stage and i think if i was working in that applied area of testing them out in populations - essentially doing the field releases and they are looking to see if you do see a decline in mosquito population, ultimately doing research with clinicians to see a decline in daily insemination, i would feel strongly if i was working on that that should be available to everybody because governments are going to use that to decide whether they want to use that technology on a wider scale and the public who are having mosquito released in their local areas may want to know the details. I think there is a strong argument for making this whole area of research openly available.",

        "ANSWER": "I guess the journal versus not being in a journal would probably inform my opinion of that data although it very much depends on exactly where I've managed to find it. The only other place that i think i would probably find anything related would be conference proceedings or conference abstracts. If it was a proper proceeding then i would take it as a work in type progress version of a journal article. If it's just an abstract then it's always difficult to tell. They don't tend to include that much data in the abstract anyway. If it was on a site like Figshare where you can just upload anything, i guess i would be a little more sceptical. Although i try to be sceptical with research articles as well. I don't think it necessarily informs, because i can just click through on Pubmed, I'm usually publication blind, if there's the title of the address and i don't tend to pay too much attention to the journal. But once i start reading then i tend to make a judgement quite quickly on whether i feel, i won't usually click through a journal unless it looks of interest but i will generally make a judgement quite quickly. If it seems like it's written in a manner which suggests that the researchers done well and then anything in which i read more detail then i try and closely observe the methodology used and what they actually publish because it's interesting in our area there are lots of people who are outside of their comfort zone because they have been working on this system and all of a sudden this brand new effect has been discovered in terms of interactions with immunity and they're not immunity researchers. So you do have interesting conversations within the lab about certain papers and kind of what their validity is but often they'll be in high ranking journals so i don't use it as much of a mechanism at the moment.",

        "ANSWER": "For pubmed i have an RSS feed with a saved search so just for key words in my field. I'll have morebacia and mosquito's and morebacia plus mosquito's because that means if i don't have much time to read papers I'll just look at the morebacia plus mosquito's because that's generally the most closely related to what i want and if there's anything that appears in that then i know it's kind of relevant. The other two are obviously much broader but i think it's due to the nature of the field it's important just to generally keep an eye on stuff. So i probably have a set of six pubmed filters which come through to our RSS feed and Google reader that i just keep an eye on. At least once a week i will just go through it and see if there's anything that could be useful and then i tend to download it to which is my reference manager that i use mostly.",

        "ANSWER": "I usually download the pdf, well the web plugin, will automatically download the pdf anyway so i just click a button and type in a couple of tags and it comes down. Sometime it doesn't work and I'll download the pdf straight into the watch folder and I'll just automatically import everything from that. I will generally download the pdf because it should automatically pull in the meta data from that including the abstract, so then I've got that. So that's usually how i get stuff. That's probably my main method of keeping up to date with the, because of the field that we're in, i haven't tested this but I'm pretty sure that the majority of stuff does end up in pubmed. I've never missed a major paper that I've known about. I've never had anyone from the rest of the lab saying - have you seen this and i haven't. So I'm pretty confident that the pubmed route is helpful. If there is a particular question then i will just do a Google search to find stuff particularly if it's not something that's related to the field but something extra that i want to check. I use Google scholar quite a lot. I don't tend to log into web of science or any of the more academic related search engines so much. But i will do if i can't find anything of interest in Google Scholar. Often it's quite a specific question that I'm wanting to answer or it usually veers between two extremes. I've either got a really specific question about a protocol for instance in which case i either find it in Google scholar or i don't and then i move on or i just need a general overview of a particular area in which case I'm generally looking for a review article, a nice rounder piece and it's rare that you can't find something in Google scholar that won't suffice. I don't do any research that requires systematic literary reviews so i don't tend to jump around too much.",

        "ANSWER": "No. I don't tend to look at books. There is one, there's an insect immunity and evolution book which was basically from a series of conference papers in 2009 and that's probably the only text book that I've purchased during my defil and that's mostly because it gives a really nice overview of insect immunity. I do use review articles - annual reviews and certainly nature reviews, genetics, nature reviews by technology, something like that but not so much books. In certain things probably previously i would have gone to the library to find a text book on or little things that i generally look up somewhere on line. There are quite detailed biology web sites that are useful or wikipedia tends to be alright for mosquito stuff it's quite well updated so if it's just a really simple question then i don't tend to go. Also the RSL which is the science library is not far but it is going to take you a few minutes walk to get up the road. There's no zoology department library anymore. I feel i would probably go and check a book more often if it was close enough but it's very rare that i need to so i tend to be solely on line journal based. I've never needed to go and look up a paper journal because everything's been published since and it's all on line.",

You basically had to cover all the main bullet points, the basic physics behind what you were investigating and the lead up to where the field is now and why the fields were now interesting and where it's going and you had to summarise if the literature available now did the field justice.There is something called systematic review and that's a way of evidence that has been collected in clinical trials to provide a top level degree of evidence for making clinical decisions. But what I'm thinking now is that's its best to be comprehensive. They have developed a set of processes to ensure that people have full completeness.I think that a perfect literature review for a tutor is one that you could hand off to someone who is going to start work in that field and they would know instantly what they are doing. It would be - here's the field as it is and run with it. It would have all the key references they would have to go and read without having to do all the work that i did.",

        "ANSWER": "I could go back quite far i guess. Well i would say the first open thing i got involved with open source. Even when i was a student i was interested in open source alternatives to windows actually at the time. I was a Linux user back in the late nineties and initially i didn't really understand how people would give away software for free. I couldn't comprehend why you wouldn't pay someone to write some software for you. It was only later that i really grasped the freedom that you get with open source. So for most of my career I've actually been principally interested in open source software but after i finished my degree i found myself working for a university library at the University of Edinburgh where i discovered the world of open access publishing and that fitted really nicely with what i thought about open source you know. It was all about sharing information and providing services on top of that information. So i got involved in the D Space repository platform and we are aiming to collect and disseminate the universities PhD thesis so the objective was to take a kind of material that was surprisingly difficult to get hold of, partly because it was in print and also partly because of political and policy reasons, not easily available and had to make that stuff available on the web. So that kind of, it was a similar change in thinking for the organization in terms of what it means to make stuff available as it was for me when i learnt about open source i suppose. So there was a nice symmetry there. So i got into open access for reasons of putting material on line and making it freely available for scholarship in particular but also in general i think. So over the years I've worked mostly with repositories up until about three years ago when i expanded my remit to cover other kinds of open access if you like so we've moved more into working with bibliography, working with research information and i just see how well connected those aspects are together and how much they can all benefit from being more open. So I've found myself in the position that I'm in now, where I'm pursuing an interest in having more stuff freely available at point of use and connecting the whole research space together. So I'm less knowledgeable about the actual scholarship but I'm interested in the administrative layer that allows that scholarship to happen in the open.",

        "ANSWER": "A very similar thing to Richard in fact. I was first interested in open source when i was fourteen or fifteen years old. I was a Linux user and it sort of immediately clicked with me. I understood why people would want to band together to produce something that was not specifically produced by a particular institution or corporation. Then i got into open access in particular in 2011 when i visited an event called. Dev. Access which was a conference which aimed to bring undergraduate students some what unconventionally in touch with how higher education gets done basically. That's where i met Cottage Labs and the faces of Mark and Richard you two and that's how i got involved in open data knowledge and open scholarship. I didn't know about those subjects before that event. I guess the reason for me to get involved was, it was again very clear, the parallels are very clear to open source software. It was clear that sharing this information would enable the scholarly sector or science to advance much further, much faster than before because at least i thought so and i still think so as i have seen it happen with computer science with my own field. Or at least with software engineering. So i thought it would work in the same way and it seems to be working in the same way. That's my reasons for getting involved.",

        "QUESTION": "What I'm wanting to do then is discuss with both of you how you've been involved in that kind of area of work in the past and what you're up to now and what it is you're going on to do in the future. I'm looking really for stuff that you're willing to discuss publicly. It doesn't need to be secret or controversial. It's just how you're involved in these kinds of fields at the moment. So i can either ask one of you to go first or if one of you wants to jump in and say something specific then feel free, you can do so. To start with then just following the pattern, Richard can you explain how is it you got involved in this work, is there a particular reason why you are involved in it?",

        "ANSWER": "As i alluded to earlier, my remit is expanded quite a lot since we set up Cottage Labs. Before i was mostly interested in repositories and interoperability of the repositories. In the last three years or so we've done projects surrounding the use of and the interchange of research information. So research information is the meta data about the search. So it's who got funded what, by whom, to produce what research output? So it's about connecting together the people, the organizations, the inputs and the outputs of the search. So we've done a lot of work with how to represent that data and how to exchange that data and how to analyze that data to produce useful business intelligence for institutions and we've done that in the open using open standards. SERIF in particular with open data. The gateway to research data specifically from the research council in the UK. At the same time we've also taken a lot of interest in the bibliographic materials. So working with the open access journals, who have a corpus of 1.6 million journal articles that are open access and some ten thousand journals are open access and we are helping them build a tool that will keep track of all of that bibliography and makes the links and text available to people who are searching through their site. So that kind of more operational stuff for researchers as opposed to research managers and then we have also been working with licensing conditions. We have a project called the Open Article Gauge where we actually attempt to determine the licensing conditions of individual articles and the purpose of that work is actually driven by a use case from the funders which is to understand how open access mandates are being complied with. So there's another aspect. So these three different aspects - the bibliography, the research information and the funder mandate all sort of interact quite nicely together in the various projects we've been doing over the last three years and I've also been involved in quite a bit of standardisation to help these different kinds of information systems talk to each other. Sword 2 is a project that I've been a technical lead on for a couple of years. It's a deposit protocol for moving content between scholarly systems and I've also been involved in ResourceSync which has been a product of the open archives initiative for exchanging change lists of information between systems. So again slightly repository focused but not strictly repository focused. Large scale interchange of data between systems. So yes, a broad range of things, of various bits of the puzzle which we are starting to put together around about now which i think is why open scholarship is a much more interesting topic right now.",

I'd say probably actually that the kinds of people that we work with are already conceptually on board with the kinds of things that we are doing so changing people's minds is not a huge issue. I would say a lot of our issues are actually operational. The people that we work with hire us because we know about software development because they don't. So that interface between developing software and technical people and non technical people can be quite challenging sometimes.",

However they often don't have the amount of time that is needed to sink in to create solutions which have a stable conceptual basis. So sometimes it sounds like people have the right idea of what to do to advance open access but in fact they haven't thought it through and they don't necessarily have the time to think it through.They iterate on prototypes with us to try and advance the field. So this has been a big issue. As much as we work with people who are already receptive to open access, it would probably be really helpful if there were a lot more people who are actively interested developing open access. So there is a larger mine share and a larger pool of brains to mine.",

        "ANSWER": "Well i think it's very difficult even for very, very experienced people in the field advocating open access and pushing it forward. I think it's very difficult even for them to say what they should do in the future, what the field should do in the future. So one of the ways to figure that out is to try and build something which is as simple as possible to begin with but is out there and is usable and useful in some way and to try and get it used by other people and once that happens, during that process those three things - useful, usable and used they end up figuring out what the field actually needs to do. You just end up gaining more insight. So we at Cottage Labs mostly form the technological part of that iteration but we actually do help with figuring out what to do as in strategy building i guess.",

        "ANSWER": "I think the best way is communication. One of the things we do is that we use a lot of communication tools to make sure that customers are fully informed on what we're up to. So we use an agile methodology for development. We have weekly meetings with the clients by Skype or Hangout or whatever. We have a collaborative notepad where we all can share content throughout meetings or in between meetings. If we want to bring something up in a meeting then it goes in a notepad and then it doesn't get lost and then we use traditional or perhaps modern traditional software engineering tools. We have a version control repository which the clients all have access to. We have an issue tracker where clients can see what issues we are encountering and they can comment on those or raise their own issues. I would say that that's the main approach we have for dealing with that. The consequence of that is that actually people aren't used to that level of communication from a development agency. A lot of old fashioned, non open sourced development agencies don't behave like that. They work much more waterfall style so sometimes it can be a bit of a culture shock for people when they work with us and see how much we talk to them and how much information we ask them for .",

        "ANSWER": "So I'll start with waterfall. Waterfall is the conical bad way to run a software engineering project, which has unfortunately become enshrined as the way to run big software engineering projects. Effectively it starts with a design process, it goes on to a development process and then to a testing process. Strictly in that order and at the end of testing if there are any problems it goes round to the very beginning again and works it's way back down the stack. Hence it's name the waterfall. It only goes in one direction, it falls down the development process. The problems with this are that sometimes you discover when you're doing the development something that might impact the design and the correct thing to do is actually to go back to the design immediately and try and resolve the issue rather than pushing on through to testing and then coming back at the end. This process tends to lead to long projects which by the end don't necessarily meet the clients requirements. Either their requirements have moved on or you didn't get their requirements quite right and you didn't notice. So agile attempts to address this by a set of principles which can ultimately be boiled down to - would you please just talk to each other, as i like to call it. The process of developing software in Agile is very iterative on very short cycles with all of the stakeholders involved in the process on the way. So the design, development and testing is all happening simultaneously and when a problem is encountered stakeholders are immediately aware and a discussion can take place and a resolution can be come up with straight away and you change direction based on changing requirements as quickly as possible. The result being much more communication with a focus on producing something at the end that is actually what the client wants at the end of the project. For reference, the Agile manifesto can be used now.",

But I'm kind of hesitant to get fixed requirements in my head which will last for months because these are almost always, they seem like a good idea if you're a developer but they're actually not because almost inevitably what happens is that the client isn't happy at the end of several months of development with very little communication feedback.

        "ANSWER": "Yes OK. I would say that your statement is slightly wrong. I would say the requirements are never wrong. Requirements simply are what you think at the time. So the requirements at the beginning could well be right for what you think you wanted at the beginning and at the end the requirements that you have should be right for the thing that you've actually built. So they don't necessarily need to be the same but that doesn't make either of them wrong. As Emanuil alluded to earlier, the process of development is also the process of discovery. You learn stuff that you didn't know before and that causes you to change the way that you think so you necessarily change your requirements. So that's the sign of a healthy project, is one where the requirements are constantly reviewed and ones that are no longer relevant are discarded and new requirements come in. So i think it's a good thing that requirements change all the time and sometimes in the process of development you're learning that what you think is a requirement isn't actually a requirement it's a hangover from a previous process and often the only way to learn that is by really digging into it and understanding what it is you're trying to do and building the software and discovering that actually there is a better way of doing this and therefore this requirement is not the requirement we thought it was. So it comes from my time at University of Edinburgh where we were working on putting thesis online and we were told early on in the project that it was a requirement that people sign some kind of license agreeing to some terms of use before they read any thesis and the people who were responsible for the print thesis were adamant that this was a requirement. So we put it on our list but we were slightly suspicious of it and as we went through the development it became clear that replicating this requirement wasn't really possible in the web environment and after a bit of to-ing and fro-ing we discovered that actually the reason they wanted people to click through a licence was the current process was that people would sign a piece of paper before they received the print thesis but the reason they signed the piece of paper was not so they had signed the piece of paper but so the librarian responsible for the thesis knew where the one copy of that print thesis was and when we understood that we understood that the requirement was not - you must click through a licence, the requirement was - we mustn't loose the copy of this thesis and so that changes the way that we approach the problem. The problem was no longer one of licensing, the problem was preservation and storage. So there is a learning process to be had by running through the development.",

        "QUESTION": "So with this issue then around what you are describing as the requirements that come up at the start of the project but aren't actually useful over a long period of time, why do you think that it is that that happens? What happens to those, were the requirements wrong at the start? Were they wrong at the end? Did they go wrong somewhere in the middle? Was it the communication? Is there any clear point at which these requirements seem to have failed to in the end to deliver what the user wants? Richard do you want to start?",

        "QUESTION": "That sort of issue then sounds like it could be something where you encounter a boundary problem in your work because if you have to tell someone who has a vested interest in a particular process, that that process should change then presumably they may not be very amenable to that given that in some cases i guess you don't even work there. Like in that example you were at Edinburgh say but as developers at Cottage Labs you then have to work with other people in their own setting of which you are not a part. Is this a problem that you need to overcome? Let's start with Emanuil. Have you Emanuil encountered this issue where you've needed to make a suggestion that changes the way that something gets done in an organization that isn't your own?",

        "ANSWER": "Well i would usually, the way that i would deal with it is i would just present my own arguments to the organization. So the question to ask - is why would i want to change anything? So the reason i want to change anything is presumably because i am focusing in some way on the clients of that organization or the stakeholders of that organization. Which is something that the organization itself should also be thinking about. So whenever i suggest a change to process, i am simply trying to help them in a way deliver better value, or experience or whatever it is their doing to their customers and those don't have to be paying customer they can be a community of people, they can be anybody. I have found that as long as i stay focused on that the organizations and the projects I've worked with are pretty receptive to change. Although having said that i have been in a similar situation but not in Cottage Labs within the last three years where i worked within an organization which was a university but within a specific department of a university which is business information systems and we had as customers all the other departments within the university. So when they had a process such as sending out thirty six thousand pieces of paper such as the accommodation office of the university in this case, they acted and reacted like a different organization to my own. So the way that i dealt with that was again that i focused on what i thought the needs of their customers were and i explained what i think those things were to them and what they can do about it because people don't necessarily realise what they can do with technology or with the time and the attention of developers. So i explained the possibilities to them and after that it was up to them. One thing I'm careful of is i don't usually push my solutions. I make suggestions but ultimately it's those peoples responsibility to satisfy their clients and to evolve their communities and to satisfy their paying customers. So ultimately that responsibility lies with them and i have to believe that they will want to do the right thing for their customers.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes actually. I would say that there are a couple of other things. First thing is that conveniently for us a lot of people that we work with are already committed to change. They are interested in having us come in and do something for them that they couldn't previously do. You know, they want to modernise or they want to change a process and that's really cool and really exciting because we get to do lots of crazy and interesting stuff. What Emanuil says stands for individual clients who need a little bit of pressure on them but there's another kind of organization that is the community. When we do projects that involve more than one stakeholder and i use stakeholder instead of client because a lot of the projects we do are publicly funded and have a public benefit aspect to them. That can be a lot more challenging to convince people that change is necessary or possible and you get a lot of push back because these are not people that are paying you to do work for then they are people where the work you are doing will impact them in some unknown way. So a good example is the UKRISS project which is a long project to develop a profile of research information data or an interchange between institutions and funder's and everyone essentially wants this but everyone is slightly afraid of what it really means to do that because it's very complex and it has consequences to everyone who's involved in this area. They are going to have to change in some way shape or form and they are not totally clear on how, and their not totally clear on how much that will cost and their not sure that what they want is being absolutely so you get a lot of resistance when you do that kind of thing and as of yet people don't know for sure how or whether we'll be able to successfully change the community but what we attempted to do to help people along was demonstrate why doing it the way UKRISS was proposing it would be a good thing. So essentially prototyping demonstrated so that people could see - ahh if we follow the approach that UKRISS is recommending then we will get these other benefits and it kind of helps people see why they should change. But that's a very slow process, much slower than having a conversation with a client.",

        "ANSWER": "Actually i guess mine is quite conventional really. So firstly if i need something to solve a particular problem but my brain is not serving up any particular titles or Internet addresses to go to, i would use a search engine - Google to describe the problem I'm having and see if others have posted the same description in the hope that someone has also posted the relevant solution. When i find an interesting solution or when i find a particular software project or software library that i think could be the foundation of interesting solutions to my problems, i try to follow it's development. So i subscribe to e-mail updates usually, twitter feeds, search. The other thing that i do is i subscribe to communities, to community updates which are usually people in the software development community who curate together information about happenings in the comunity within the last week and then will push out updated either via twitter or e-mail. One of the ones that I'm following that has been really, really helpful is Python mailing list which is basically news on Python projects which is a language we use in Cottage Labs quite a lot. So i guess i mostly, to recap it, i mostly rely on other people's curated information that i find interesting and other people having asked the same question before and me being able to find the question they asked and the answer to it.",

So what we have got there is very interesting in terms of how you actually go about doing your development work with the people that you're working with. Now I'd like to know a bit how you personally do your work yourself and how the fact that that's open source development has an affect. So for example could you explain a bit about how do you learn about the technologies you use? and when you encounter problems or need to learn something more, where do you get information on the things you are trying to learn yourself?

        "ANSWER": "I usually tend to find it for free. If for example the Google search itself it appears to be free in any case but they definitely don't require that you need to pay anything up front or they don't even require registration. What they do is they maintain a catalogue or an index of pages and their content on the internet. So from that point they wouldn't give me the actual content that i wanted so i stumbled on a huge variety of websites, so from then on i go onto individual websites. Some of them do require subscription or payment and i usually immediately discard those. The reason being not that I'm unwilling to pay for a solution but because i know that in my community the software development community, doing these things, paying for subscribing takes an inordinate amount of time. You are already looking through and trawling through a huge pile of results to get what you want. If one result specifically requires you to spend time paying or registering then that's just not acceptable or what if it's not what you want. It has to all be available immediately for reading in full in front of me otherwise i will just discard it. There is a network effect to that, i know that other people in my community will think the same. So the people who are likely to give good answers will also not want to subscribe in order to post an answer. So the more barriers there are, the less likely it is that the information is of any use",

        "ANSWER": "I would guess that my experiences are similar. If I'm adopting a new technology my two initial things are, first of all - do i know anyone who already knows it and can i ask them? You two for example are my go to guys for some stuff because you know as expert programmers you have insights in to things i might want to learn how to do. So i quite often actually go to a peer group first, possibly to the online documentation which again as Emanuil said which i would expect to get for free and then if it's a new Python module or something like that i will just install it and start playing about with it and when i get stuck i tend to just Google the errors. In particular we haven't mentioned anything by name so i will - Stack overflow has enormous resources available to answer all kinds of questions and in almost all areas there is a hit in Stack overflow for the problem you're having and that is all available for free and you have to register if you want to add content but you don't have to register if you just want to read content. But if you do add content you can post your own questions there and you can get answers back and it's very expert community on there. An interesting feature there, coming back to what Emanuil was saying about there being some sites where you have to pay, i quite often encounter sites which have adverts on them and or suggest that you might want to join their specialist user community which seem to just be mirroring content from Stack Overflow. So it's almost like the private or pay section is leeching content from the public section of the internet in order to get you to pay for stuff which is already available for free. The other thing that I'd add just to back up my open source credentials is that sometimes when I'm really stuck i do open source code and i have a look and I've resolved issues with software before by doing that.",

There's so many resources available online for software developers and the resources are just getting bigger and better so i would say that if anything it's going to get easier. Although of course obviously there is more stuff to trawl through to find the answers but the answers are out there certainly.",

When i was younger and just getting into computing i used to be fascinated with, specifically maybe a bit strangely with system administrators who would maintain their own corner of the Internet. They had their own machine and they were connected their machine was connected to all the other machines but they would do anything well most things in order to maintain that connectivity, in order to keep that material available which usually meant free for the public to read as well. I would want to keep this cultural tradition i guess and pass those values on to people that i work with. Say if i worked with younger people or somebody inexperienced in the field. I would try to teach them those values.",

        "ANSWER": "I certainly hope that we will be able to pass on the values. There's a lot of interesting work in the pipeline. Both for Cottage Labs and for the open source higher education sector as a whole. There's lots of interesting work around open access compliance and mandates and how to make the open access infrastructure as good technically as the existing publishing infrastructure and there's a lot of interest in doing that so i'm anticipating there will be a lot of work on infrastructure for open access in the coming years and certainly within Cottage Labs as you know there are only a few of us we're pretty good at what we do even if i do say so myself that i think that if we wanted to pass on skills to a new generation or a younger group of programmers who have an opportunity to do so and also expand the company to do more of this cool stuff that's coming up.",

        "ANSWER": "Well that's a good question. Well i can answer the second one first of all. Social problems are always harder than technical problems, that's a rule of thumb. I would say that the technology that we need is not mostly is not too complex. I mean it's not necessarily straight forward but we are approaching open access infrastructure services so publishing services, peer review services, text mining services whatever it is that we need to expose and disseminate and manage all of this scholarly content. We are approaching the delivery of those services in the same way that developers approached the delivery of open source software. So an actual installable piece of software is built by a collection of people and is installed by individuals who are interested in using it. Services are slightly different in that somebody somewhere has to ultimately run it. So we are approaching the development of the services in a similar way that we're approaching the development of open source software. Which is that groups of people who are interested in this stuff are clubbing together and developing the technology and developing the service provision and carrying out the culture change required. So there are some organizational challenges around building the technology that are separate from the social challenges of getting people to use it. But i also think that when we move into a more open development of infrastructure that we have the opportunity to build more cool difficult technology. You know we are already working with some very high end search and text analytical stuff just at Cottage Labs and we're not even on the from line of that really crazy stuff that you can do with text analysis. So I'm sure that there are some hard technical challenges that can be tackled but i don't think that they are problems, i think they are opportunities by moving into a more open development space. So no i don't think the technical challenges are particularly large but i think the organizational challenges aboutf building the technology are quite difficult and i think the social challenges will always be a hard problem and all you can do is build the technology, show people how great it is and use that to lead the way",

It's also, sometimes i do forget that you have to have a technological solution in mind when it's really needed because there are a surprising amount of people who are just unable to both do the technology and source building of the technology within their professional networks. So actually progress depends on the people who know the right technology or who know the right people and build it. That's my current feeling about this list and so therefore it's important to get the right people together, That's just something that i think i will try to focus on more once i get the opportunity to, not to just focus on immediate technological problems to resolve.",

        "ANSWER": "I guess i would add explicitly, we have pretty much talked around this, the way that open should work essentially, open source has really pointed the way to how open can really, really work and really get people engaged. It works by, effectively it's vendor independence. You can build the stuff that you want. It's about the freedom to build the stuff you want and for different people to offer you the services around the same artifact if you like. So in the desktop market Red Hat for example offer a Linux distribution and they will deploy it to the organization and they will supply and support it just like Microsoft support windows. But if you ever get annoyed with Red Hat, you can simply stop paying them to support the software and either support it yourself or pay someone else to support it. So this kind of service model is exactly the same kind of model that i think open scholarship ultimately needs to fit into somehow. The stuff is free but the services around it might not necessarily be free but you want the ability for anyone to provide those services so that you maximise competition and therefore increase quality.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes, i think currently there is a lot of focus on open access and open scholarship to simply push forward, to advance the field as much as possible, within the shortest time frame possible and sometimes i think it's interesting to look back and see what's current in the mainstream and analyze those processes but within the context of open access and also think about how that gap could be bridged. A lot of people shout for just discarding all the old stuff and bringing in all the new stuff and that's OK that's how change gets pushed, that's progress gets pushed but I'd be quite interested in the social and business aspects of backwards compatibility quote on quote and whether it wouldn't be possible to tap into the professional, you just tap into the people networks that comprise the current mainstream within scientific publishing and convince them little by little with carefully crafted examples and with carefully crafted statements to move on and to change parts of their processes. Basically i guess what I'm saying is to treat the people who are already doing this work right now, with a little bit more respect and think a bit more about them instead of simply thinking about change. Change and progress is very good but i think it's also interesting to think about the current status quo and see it from an almost condescending angle but also a more compassionate angle and think of how we can help them with change rather than just discard them.",

        "ANSWER": "So the library has been interested in open access over the last ten years for a number of reasons. Historically the library has been interested due to the Serial's Crisis and journal subscription prices have increased yearly and general library budgets are not been increasing in line with that. In the early years open access was seen as a way of pushing back against that and maybe seen as an alternative. That's some early motivation for the library to be involved. But i think it goes beyond that now. The library has been early adopters of repository software. It has been an un-organice process from adopting early typologies like repositories and fitting them for use within an institutional setting like a university and looking at how they can be used so using them in different scenarios so technologies like D Space. We deploy them in various situations and we work with open source software to try and fulfill a need for the university. So there is a whole reason background about why we are being involved with open access and open source. Our team has grown organically around this. So in the early days there were just one or two people involved in project work and over the years the project work has grown into services and as those services need staffing to actually support them within the institution, we've had the team grow. So we started off in the early years with PhD thesis and electronic versions and developing infrastructure for the university to be able to look after electronic PhD thesis. We've moved beyond that through E Prints and looking at how we can use repository systems to make the scholarship from the university open. But we have also moved into other areas such as research assessment exercises like the Ref. So our teams been supporting that, the collection of the data behind that and looking at various systems to be able to collect and record that information. We've seen like an evolution of simple repository systems right through to Kris type systems that we have today so current research systems that we are currently using to not just collect information about research outputs, and not just outputs themselves also tie them in with, tie them to research projects that they are associated with and people. So we are kind of moving away from silo's of information to actual connected information that people can use in interesting ways.",

So researchers publish their work in journals, we have the publishers take on this role and they will publish the journals and make sure that they're archived they're available, they're curated. There is also a lot of information that is created that is not looked after by anyone apart from the university so we're in a position that spans across the institution and we can pick up these objects, these items, these pieces of scholarship, these outputs and we can make sure that we look after them. So we started off with PhD thesis. So we've always had a mandate to look after hard copies but increasingly now material is being made in electronic format and is born digital so we're having to make sure that we are prepared to take this information and look after it and that's where repositories initially stepped in. They were platforms that we could take and use to start looking after this information but we quickly realised those other born digital information that was being created in the university that no-one else was looking after. So the problem is that a lot of this information might be ephemeral. So someone might set up a web page and it would be available for five or ten years but then what about the long term. The university has been around since the fifteen hundreds, we're looking at a long term game here so we need to try and build systems and processes that can look after information in those kind of timescales. So we're looking at our repository system as a way to take on board this information and make sure that it's available in a format for future generations. So we started off with PhD thesis but are kind of moving on beyond that to other forms of grey literature and now we are also looking at other forms of information produced within the university. So quite often we have researchers coming to us who want to publish their own material free from the constraints of traditional scholarly publishers so they want to set up their own journal and yet there's nothing stopping you setting up your own journal, creating a web site - and there you go, you've got a journal. But once again there is this problem with ephemeral information, is it still going to be there in five years, ten years, twenty years time? So we've started using the open system software journal to create a platform for scholars and researchers within the university to publish their own journals and we can provide a platform for them to do this that is managed in a professional way and they can get on with the management side of running a journal but we can worry about the technology side. So we started from one place but we are organically growing into other areas.",

        "ANSWER": "So i originally trained as a Geologist and have a doctorate in Geology and part of that process was involved in researching literature from the seventies in quite obscure literature from French PhD thesis where there might be one or two copies available and the copies of these information were kind of shared around supervisors and you'd have a tatty paper copy that you'd be able to borrow for a week or so and then you'd make a photocopy of this and that would get passed around and it was very difficult to get hold of the information - maps, literature. It was one of the most difficult parts of writing the thesis was actually actually to do the literary review, actually that should be the easiest. You should be able to have the information and then carry out your research on top of that. But actually getting it to understand what has been published before has been a problem. That kind of got me interested in how to publish PhD thesis more effectively and when i finished my doctorate, there was a project at the university setting up E thesis repository. So as I've had background in kind of writing a thesis i understood the problems in that and i wanted to be involved in setting up a platform process for students from Edinburgh to be able to share their work more effectively than people from previous generations who couldn't.",

        "ANSWER": "So when i was writing my thesis quite often we'd look at previous PhD thesis produced by other students from the same supervisor and the only way to get copies of these was to actually borrow a copy of your supervisors, which is you'd go into his office and there would be a whole range of the hard back thesis on the shelves and you could borrow a thesis and look at it and have an understanding. It was an informal library. If you came to the library and tried to borrow a copy you were told - sorry you're a post graduate student you're not allowed to borrow a copy and you're like well how am i supposed to consult this literature and use it? Because at the time on staff members were allowed to borrow a thesis. So there were a lot of barriers in place to actually access information and consult the literature and so quite often you'd have informal work around where you'd borrow your supervisors copy and you'd go if you wanted to see a work from a different university you'd have to try and get a copy through inter library loans and if that didn't work you'd go directly to the supervisor there and borrow their copy and that's not a particularly sustainable way of doing things, that's not easy. How does someone who can't travel to visit your supervisor, how can they borrow the work? So the early project i was involved in was setting up a repository system for the University of Edinburgh for the students to use to upload their PhD thesis into a repository and make them available via the web on an open access basis. Fast forward a few years and it went from a project into a service where the university actually passed a mandate in 2005 where all students must submit an electronic copy to the university library. So now we have gone from a system where people could only access a hard copy from their supervisors but now their is an electronic copy in the library which they can consult if they want. So i think that's quite a big step change that we've introduced.",

        "ANSWER": "So there are a lot of subject discipline differences in attitudes towards sharing thesis and dissertations on line. So for science and engineering it's quite common for people to put their thesis on their own web pages and so for example computer sciences are very happy with putting their content in repositories. Other disciplines like humanities and social sciences were a lot slower to come on board. So some subjects like divinity or law their has been a hesitancy to put electronic thesis on line for anyone to read. Recently history has been one subject area tha has been talking about having on line embargo's for a minimum of five years just to protect history. So we're dealing with a base line of a wide range of different attitudes towards sharing dissertations. So currently the situation we have here is that students must submit an electronic copy but they can request a one year embargo to the electronic version and at the end of that year they can request for it to be extended. However we are trying to move the norms to having material that is open. In some cases there might be situations where it's not appropriate to share this information, meaning because it's commercially sensitive or someone is applying for a patent so then we have to have an embargo or there might be sensitive material in there, patient confidentiality. So we have to have some way of having embargo's in there. But it's a light touch, we try and have as many thesis as open as possible. So currently we have around seven thousand items in our repository of which four or five thousand are PhD thesis of which four hundred have some kind of time limited embargo. So we are talking less than one percent ball park figure.",

        "ANSWER": "So take for example referencing for a published PhD thesis. You would give the author, date and title and say it's an unpublished PhD thesis from the University of Edinburgh. For the papers I've written certainly people haven't done that before we've referenced a PhD. Now typically if someone wanted to go through to the references and check the material and read the material, they would find it very difficult to obtain a copy of that thesis as it's on a shelf on the library and they may or may not be able to read that piece of literature which seems kind of backwards. If you are referencing a piece of work that you know people can't access, so morally that felt wrong. It leads to the question where you can cite a piece of work that you know people can't access, there's the possibility of fraud creeping into the work. Where as if you move to the situation we are in now where you can just cite a URL and say this is the location where i accessed this material. You can go there too and have it instantly. It's a complete step change. So the situation where we have gone from and to is a lot better.",

        "QUESTION": "So I'm quite interested in this point where in the past you had to look at the works that were say present in a supervisors collection and you would get a copy of that and read that and look at that and you then had to reference that you had done so in your literature review, and similarly now someone might get a copy from a repository or from a web page or from a subject repository rather than an institutional repository and they'll have to reference that. How do you think then that situation has changed, often there's this idea that referencing what you read and where it was very straight forward in the past and now has become hard but it seems from what you were saying that the copies that you had access to are not necessarily the golden ones?",

        "ANSWER": "So with our repository systems at the Edinburgh research archive they built them with a long term mind set from the start. So when you put content in there that you want to maintain for the long term, we would try and have a versioning system so if you add new material and want to change it it's kind of clear what people are accessing. Typically for thesis literature, once you have submitted a thesis it doesn't change. So in that respect it's fairly simple. Other types of material once again very rarely changes. So other types of information that we are collecting we are putting into repositories are exam papers from the university. Typically these were just put into, collected in hard back books that people could use at the library and photocopy. We are now collecting pdf's which we were putting on web pages but we are now putting in repository systems.",

So are you currently doing anything or looking at anything for the future to start to consider those issues? Like if i reference a piece of work right now and i say it's at this address, how does someone know later?, the simple solution is that like you said the work is ephemeral, it's no longer there. What if it still there how do you know it's the same?",

        "ANSWER": "So previously we'd been working on the Research Excellence framework and the reason I'm familiar with that is that it's a process where every seven years or so the university submits a return and the outputs of the university are judged and ranked and it's extremely important for the university cause a lot of the research budget for the university comes from the performance from the Ref and the library is involved in terms of collecting publication details and in the last few research assessment exercises and now the Ref, it's felt like a convulsive exercise where it's just a rush, a panic to gather the information. So we have now put in place a current research search information system that makes it easy to maintain a profile, a record of what's been produced at the university. So it used to be the case that if you asked someone at the university what does the university do, what are it's outputs? It would be very difficult for that person to find out. What they would actually probably do is take a round about view. They'd probably go to Web of Science and do an institutional search there and try and work out what has been published formally. So if you think about that it's kind of a strange way to go about what you as an institution is doing by going to a third party asking them well what have we done, being told what you've done. Isn't it a far better situation to record what you're doing and have your own systems in place. So we've now set up a current research information system to do this and the idea is that we collect information about research outputs, all different types of publications not just journal articles, conference proceedings, book chapters but everything. Including areas of impact, so people have done press, news items, clippings other performance indicators are collected as well. So we've also been reporting citation data from different sources and we are also linking outputs to people as well. So that when people move universities we can then send a record with that person to a new institution and say here's a file of all of these peoples publications and all of their projects and similarly if someone comes to us from a different institution they can bring a similar portfolio with them. So that's not in place yet but we are working towards that.",

        "ANSWER": "So the new RCUK policy has been in place for nearly a year now and we're coming up to the reporting period on that and there's a couple of aspects on the reporting. So RCUK have given the institution a block grant to pay for general article processing charges. So we'll be reporting on how much money the institution spends on these APC's and so RCUK can then look at it's investment and see what it's bought for the money. The other side of the reporting is to tell which grants haven't made their research outputs open. So how do you know that? First of all we have to collect all the publication information from the university. So we'll be collecting that information and putting that into our Kris system and then trying to link projects to that information so that we can quickly query that information. So in the first year RCUK asked for a 45% compliance figure. So we are hoping we can meet that figure by collecting all of the information and putting it into our Kris system and then querying it. It's reliant on us getting all of the information and linking it to grants as well. Other research funders like the Welcome Trust take a slightly different approach. So they require all of their funded research to be made open and they way they judge that is if it has a pub med central ID or not. So it has to be in pub med central. If it doesn't have a pub med central iD then as far as they are concerned it's not open. So they check all of the publications that a researcher submits to the Welcome, they check to see if it's got a pub med central ID. So if a researcher is submitting a grant application and they have that publication list but it doesn't have a pub med central ID they then discount it, they say well it's not open access so we're not interested in it. So they are taking a tougher line than RCUK, they are saying all of our research, 100% has to be open access and have a pub med central ID. If it's not made open then we're having financial sanctions as well. They are looking at an article basis of 100%. So we are trying to help researchers at Edinburgh comply with that so if a researcher comes to us and says i'm submitting a grant application but i don't have a pub med central ID, help what do i do? We can assist them in the process of getting a pub med central ID wither by submitting it to pub med central and deposing a manuscript that way or retrospectively going back and requesting an APC fee.",

        "ANSWER": "It's becoming smoother. So we've set our scholarly communication team up to be a support service to support researchers. Quite a common theme we get when talking to researchers is that this is something they have planned for. It's another admin task that they don't want to spend their time doing. So we're saying - you don't have to, we can do it for you and there is a team of people here that will assist you to reinterpret your way through journal copy write policies or research funder mandates. Work out what you need to do to make your work open whether that's deposit in a repository which we prefer or if your funder mandates that you deposit it in to the pub med central then you might have to pay a gold processing charge. So we're here to take that admin overhead from researchers and so from that point of view we're helping them, supporting them. So we're being received a lot more gratefully. Rather than someone saying make your work open, here's what you need to do. So instead of telling people what to do we're saying we're here to help and that's been seen as a lot better. Going forwards i think the main impact that I've seen over the last few years are research funders with open access mandates and that's really grabbing peoples attentions and forcing them to engage with open access in ways which they hadn't necessarily had to before. Researchers need help and support with that so we're in the ideal position to help them go through this transition period. We are in a unique and privileged position really where we can see in between researchers and councils and we can see, we actually have time to look at the data and interpret that so we are actually seeing how much investors are spending on open access and we can aggregate that data and analyze it and actually make people aware of the issues. So currently we're seeing we're going through a transition period where universities are paying for subscription access to their journals but they are also paying article processing charges to make them open access and currently it's quite an open field the markets quite elastic. We are seeing a wide variability in article processing charges, we're not seeing anyone reporting on these, we're not seeing anyone taking responsibility so i think part of our role is to actually report on this and say this is how much the university is paying for these deals and try and be as open with the data as possible. So we're one of the early adopters of open data. Last year we published a Welcome Trust mandate on line. This year we've seen the Welcome Trust publish their own data and we'd like to feel that we're partly responsible for planting the seen in their head that they should be doing this. We've asked them to do it but they haven't done it in quite a while but now they are publishing their own data because they are seeing that when you have a closed system people will charge the maximum price for a product that they can get away with and if you have a closed system then there's no reason to be competitive. But if we publish all of our data we can say hey look this is exactly what we're paying and then we can start to see a fair charge for open access publishing charges. Love them or hate them they are not going away they are here with us so we have to try and manage the process a bit better.",

        "ANSWER": "We can only really report on what people are paying. We are in a position to actually aggregate that data and publish it and do some analysis of it. So you know we could say that pure open access journals tend to charge less but library journals charge a lot more, discuss. We can't really make value judgements on that, we can only really say - here are the facts and then we can publish that and make people aware. What we need to do for the future is to make sure that the institution gets the best deal possible it can for publishing. So we would expect for example our journal subscriptions to be in line with our open access spend and in the recent Finch report it was mentioned that there should be no net increase, it should be, it should kind of pay for itself. So we need to make sure that the amounts the institution is paying as a whole to the publishing industry and try and get the best deal possible.",

        "ANSWER": "I have been analyzing data to look at the transmission of the canopy which is essentially, you measure the radiation under the canopy and you measure it outside the canopy and the take a ration of the two.So you get about 50% and 50% of the light.That is the simplest explanation. There are lots of complicated ways of modeling the forest cover and we have collected data on a wide variety of scales. We have a terrestrial laser scanner with us which sends out a laser beam to give you out millions of points and gives you essentially a 3-D representation of the entire forest canopy. As about as detailed as you can possibly get in those sort of surveys and we took lots of hemispherical photographs which were taken from the ground looking up the way which give you a good impression of how much sky is visible from any individual spot. We have some airborne data sets that are available to us. there was a big lydar survey which was done a few years ago which gives canopy height maps over big kilometres scales which we can thenuse to upscale the findings we get and try and get some generalised parameters that can be expanded to look at larger areas. To look at larger scales we can then use satellite data sets. There are satellites such as ISAT or Modus which have several different parameters that those satellites can then measure and then compare to our data to upscale to the arctic as a whole.",

        "ANSWER": "Yes. We have published two papers so far and another two are hopefully coming out quite soon and those are in journals that i guess you'd call traditional journals. One of them quite interestingly was a method i developed for analysing these hemispherical photographs that i spoke about and i submitted it to a journal that i guess was a well respected journal, quite high impact but quite high publication charges as well. It got mixed reviews and in the first round of reviews i ended up rewriting it significantly and realised that there were flaws in the section that all the reviewers had picked out. I actually ended up removing that section and having it a lot shorter. As it happened, that journal asked me to re-submit and i did so. It only got one review back which was very short and it said: i still have reservations about this particular bit but otherwise it's OK. After that the editors decided that this had had too many reviews and they wouldn't accept it now. I found this slightly annoying as i felt i had been humble in accepting the limitations of the initial submission which did have significant weaknesses once they were pointed out to me. I felt slightly let down by the review process of that journal at that time. Anyway we ended up submitting it because by that point i had a bigger more substantial paper which was actually reporting all the data that we collected in the Arctic and it was referencing all that i was describing in the earlier paper. In order to get it out quickly we submitted it to an open journal which my PI recommended as being one that would publish it quickly at a low cost and it got a review which wasn't particularly substantial, although i felt it had been paired down so much by these other reviews that i feel it was a peer reviewed piece of work. But since then i realised that this publisher is on a list of predatory publishers that has come up quite a lot in the science news recently. Many of which will publish papers with no reviews what so ever, as long as you pay them. This is i guess a weakness of open access and makes a lot of academics wary of open access as a concept",

        "ANSWER": "I think the whole peer review process is useful as long as your honest and open about what you have done and as a reviewer you are honest and open about your own experience and interpretation because i review a lot of the papers myself and in some cases where I'm not a particular expert but i can give an informed opinion on, then i will honestly say in a review - i might be misunderstanding here but this seems a bit strange to me. This approach that you have used etc etc and i guess you don't want to appear too humble because your offering a professional opinion but it's a difficult balance to strike. I certainly spend quite a lot of time on a review if I'm asked to review a paper. I think, i read that the average is two hours that people spend doing a review which seems crazy to me. I think to properly read a research paper often takes two hours or more and then to write the review would take another two hours. It usually takes half a day or more on reviewing a paper or an evening and it's something that academics are just expect it to do. I do find it useful when I'm publishing papers myself. i think the reviews can often make the paper better. The paper i went onto publish, i was very pleased, it was the longest research paper i had ever written and it was based on two big field campaigns and i had quite a lot of modelling work and i had summarised all that.It was a lot of work to put it all together. The reviews were very thorough. One in particular, the reviewer actually revealed themselves to me and it was someone that i had communicated with over the last few years and it was someone doing similar work and i guess technically is competitor but we exchange ideas and i think that is a very positive aspect of peer review.I actually reviewed one of his papers as well not long ago. I think a lot of outsiders look at peer review and they think it's people with their mates giving each other the benefit of the doubt. You don't give anyone the benefit of the doubt at all. Scientist are there own harshest critics and i think you would only reveal your identity if you were giving a positive review. I have given negative reviews to good friends of mine that have published papers that i thought were a bit weak and in those cases that's were the anonymity is useful. I think people would be less willing to give negative reviews if they had to reveal their identity. It's difficult to draw the line as i guess you should be willing to openly criticise if you're being extremely crtical of something.But editors have to give a decision i guess as editors aren't usually experts on all the papers that come into their journals. They have to trust the reviews that they get.",

You only have to look at Internet forums to see that people are very different in what they write anonymously to how they are in public, and you know you wouldn't necessarily go up to a person and say the same things that you might say in a review. Personally, I'd like to think that i would but i would do it very politely and i try to be polite in the negative reviews that i write. I've had some reviews of my own work from people that aren't that polite but that's up to them. Maybe they're not that polite in person, you never know.",

It could be a years worth of work that you're reporting in this paper and then if someone says it's rubbish and you feel they haven't fully understood the paper. I guess that might be the fault of what you have written in the paper it's not clear enough what you did, but you can understand that someone might take it that this is a deliberate from a competitor in some cases. I dont' think that's an issue in the field i world in but I'm sure that influences things in other fields. As a reviewer i try to be as humble as possible and say i may I've misunderstood here and maybe i need more information that's not actually in the paper. Can you provide this as in some cases i find it hard to make a judgement on how good the science is because it's not reported in sufficient detail for me to make that judgement.",

Sometimes you want something to be specific for people in a particular fields in a specialised field and so you'll publish in a specific journal for a targeted community, you might know the people involved from being at conferences with them and they are the people that will be interested. When I've had a big piece of research based on a bigger time period I've submitted that to bigger journals that are more generic to the Geo sciences area. The geophysical research is the big one that people use when they have findings that are more general and will be interesting to the wider community",

That happens with a lot of journals and mine wasn't up to scratch on the first submission and I'm aware of that but i changed it hugely and made it a lot shorter and more focused and i feel it's a good bit of work and I've presented it in conferences where people have been impressed by it's published in a low impact journal from a predatory publisher but it's out there and it's referenced. I used it to cite in a more respected journal and i referenced it there.

A few months later they'll see it published in another journal where obviously the author has submitted it again and again with hardly changing anything until they have luck with reviewers. That's disheartening, it's inevitable when reviewing is subjective to a small extent. If they get lucky with a reviewer who hasn't got much time and wants to bash out a review quickly. Which i never always write at least three or four pages in a review. If it's a really good paper the it's easy as usually a page of two will do but usually i do three of four pages.",

        "ANSWER": "Not necessarily, i've looked at lots of published paper and occasionally you'll see ones and wonder how they got published. There is the fact that you need to be subjective about any paper because a lot of it comes from fads: how sexy a bit of science is, if they get a good headline out of it, such as in the Daily Mail - this causes cancer, and this causes cancer. Those factors are always there. There are special issues that journals have where a lot of groups have cobbled together a paper on various work they have done because the journal wants to explore a particular theme at a particular time. I think that's great, it gives people a deadline and a focus to get some of their work out there. The fact that something has been published shouldn't be an automatic stamp of quality. When you read a paper you should make your own judgement then and there. You shouldn't say this should be accepted knowledge. You are essentially reviewing it every time you read it.",

        "ANSWER": "Data is a different exercise. We have been careful to document all the quality control for the data sensors. You have the sensors sitting out there in the arctic sitting on top of a snow pack some of them will sink into the pack so they aren't level any more and we were checking them every day and updating, and brushing off snow fall. So we were taking detailed notes, updating data and discarding data where the sensors were covered with snow or at an unreasonable angle. We have documented that as an appendix in the published paper. We can refer to that. For bigger scales sets, NASA have lots of stuff. They have certain alga rhythms that they use to process data from the satellites which are open to interpretation. They do there best to filter data. When there's cloud cover and they're not seeing the surface.That's complicated, we trust NASA. Colleagues of mine are working on seeing how good NASA data is and use data from the ground and from the aircraft which are closer to the ground to validate satellite data and to check that you get a decent between the satellite speed and what you see on the actual ground. Quality control, being aware of what you're looking at and the limitations of it as well.",

        "ANSWER": "In terms of accessing papers, one of these big journals sells their papers in bundles to libraries where only two of three of those journals are of interest to the university but you have to buy the huge chunk and the mount it costs libraries to have this research available is ridiculous. Academics are getting angry that these big journals are making big profits based on a model where they are still printing hundreds of thousands of copies of journals. I don't remember the last time i went to the library to look at a hard copy of a paper. They are all almost available on line. Running a website when the infrastructures are in place have these facilities in place where you have the web of science to access papers. A journal receives the papers, send them to reviewers which often the author recommends. Submitting a paper can take hours, you have to paste the abstract, the authors and all their affiliations, key words and highlights within 140 characters. It's exasperating. Then you have to upload all your figures separately, so it's almost at a point where they can press a button and say format into our journal style and there it is. It's sent to reviewers who work for free, then there's editors who work for free or a small allowance and i don't know what the journals do to earn these large profits and why it should cost three thousand pounds to have something open access especially when it's paid for by the tax payer a lot of the time.",

        "ANSWER": "In the future, if we could identify an open access publishers that are thorough in their peer reviews process and don't cost a fortune.Then i would submit papers to them. I have my career to think about but the fact is that things are still judged on impact factor and some of these new journals that are open access don't cost a fortune don't have the impact factor yet, but hopefully if some of the younger researchers can ignore impact factors and say if you can publish the reviews on line, which quite a a lot are starting to do. Then i will certainly go for those. To be honest i think some of the bigger journals are having to accept that their fees are unreasonable. I had one published last year in a big journal that was based on a previous job on a grant that had expired and we didn't have the money to pay for it. We has some rich Swiss co-authors that agreed to pay some of the fees and they agreed to cut the fee to a third of the initial cost as we didn't have the money",

The man that i met doing the research for Malaria was Matt Close and he is a well known researcher here in the Netherlands and he set up a web site a few years before for the Malaria researchers in the whole world, the Malaria world and he made a listing of all the relevant literature that came out weekly and we found of course that lots of this literature is not accessible to many of the leaders of the Malaria world platform and then we naturally came to try and find the open access information and try and do things so that we can multiface Malaria researchers to publish in the open access journals.

I think that the years before there were not many changes, There was a bit of change but especially the last two years. The attention for open access has been growing enormously and it's just lucky that i have witnessed the whole development from being virtually known to a small group of scientists and students to something almost a word movement now. Of course there are lots of people that are not so for open access at the moment but it's really gained enormous attention. Also in the Netherlands politically and politically in the USA and UK and i think that being with the Open Knowledge Federation, involved as an open access co-ordinator for activities has helped me a lot to make the connections that i need to be able to work in this specific field.",

So i have experienced access problems with literature but most of the time i have by passed these by accessing the literature through library accounts of my friends. But that's not the way that you want to do science. So there were some key figures that i met, especially Matt Todd who did open science for Malaria and who is a real proponant for doing science the way he does it. Bringing everything in the open, the notebooks the lab note books, the ideas and he says that everything i do should be openly done and should be open access and everybody can see how much he has attained and how many results he has obtained by working with everybody that is interested to work with him. So i met a lot of people. Some did have access but say were idealistically in favour of open access. Other people were very much against the open access in journals but only open access for repositories. So there are lots of different people that perhaps also chase different ideas on open access still.",

Only most of the organizations that want to say we are going for open access, in the first place what they do is offer free reading and there is nothing done in the way of you being able to use anything that you published and you can download the articles especially that is what you want if there's a lot of literature and it's not open access in the sense of the Budapest declaration then everybody can for example read a thousand articles in my field of Malaria but you don't have the time to do that so what you really want to be able to do is to download lots of stuff and have it treated by computers by text mining and by data mining and see what you come up with and as long as that is not possible, we don't obtain the goal of open access i guess and there are a lot of problems at the moment there.

        "ANSWER": "Yes. I think that what we want to do is spread the word that open access is not about being able to read something only but you will have to be able to take it with you. Like going to a book shop. It's an open access book shop. You should be able to take all the books out of the exhibition that they have and you can read in it and you can do things but you are not allowed to take it with you unless you pay. That is not the way that we want to do it. So i think that my work as i have it in my mind is to try and convince people of the principles of open access. That it has to be completely unrestricted and reusable, being able to text mine being able to data mine lots of information that is somewhere available. The other problem is not only that you have access to the stuff but that you will be able to find things easily and then you can hear people saying - look if you put something in a repository in open access then everyone can find it using Google or something and then you put it on your computer and you can just read it. But my feeling is that that's not the way it should be. For example again for Malaria there are all kinds of articles in twenty or two thousand repositories all round the world and then nobody is able to pick out those articles and go through all of them and do text mining etc but everybody has to go to this specific place and try then to see if the computer is up and if you can have access to that free database and then spend the time reading it and not being able to do anything else. That is not what we want.",

Except they have to just do an attribution to get some of the work and if it's me, then they attribute me and if it's some of the co-workers then they also attribute the co-workers. That's the only thing. The sense of the CCBY licence is OK for me. Completely OK for me. I am also at ease with it. Not that i talk to myself that i have to accept it because i have come to the conclusion that i can gain a lot more by putting these things available out in the open and getting a lot of response. That builds on my work, that it will improve enormously in the way that i can't do it on my way.",

Then this protocol is a valuable thing for a company. They don't want to have all the ins and outs published on the Internet. So you have to patent it and I'm not against patenting things. But patenting things is quite another thing from open access. I can understand that there are people working in science or in other things that take a patent on some methods or some specific publications but if you want to advance science as a whole enterprise then you should share as much as possible.",

I think that he himself is even convinced that he doesn't need to take patents on things that he develops because in his mind he develops a procedure for example and then he puts it in the open and then people somewhere in the world are improving or giving him ideas on how to improve on his methods. So he does and he gains a lot of trust and a good network of people around him and then in the end there is a method that he uses to obtain the goals that he wants and lots of other people in the world that work with him, can work with his methods and speed up the whole process. So he doesn't use patents at all. i can understand that there are people working in companies doing science that to a certain degree if they are involved with patents, that is different from the open access thing that we are talking about here.",

        "ANSWER": "I think there are two groups of people actually. Students that you talk with are very much in favour of open access. In the sense of the Berlin declaration and we have seen in the last Berlin conference for the young investigators that there was a huge platform for doing things in the open access way and there was also a lot of attention in the whole world in particular congress conference. But if you go to Africa for example. South Africa, Ethiopia there are scientists working on things and they are very unhappy with the situation where they have to put their work out in the open because they say then Mr X will take all my work and i don't get paid for it and i will now not get promotion and all these kinds of things. It's a big issue. They are very afraid of giving their ideas and their work and putting it in the open and of course that is also the first reaction that people have here in the Northern Hemisphere, say someone who is not a scientist and you tell then these ideas and then all these other people can steal your idea. That is the way that people react in the first place and after some thinking they say well it doesn't have to be that way of course if you do a discussion. I really go through the moods of - but why do you want to protect your ideas do you think they are great, do you think that other people couldn't have those ideas? and then they say no, but my promotion and my recognition but if you put it on the Internet then everybody knows you were the one to do it because it's your name and even having CCBY Licenses, everybody is obliged to recognise you as the author so what's the problem because if you do that then you can have a lot of interaction with other people who perhaps admire your work or find something that they have an eye for to improve. So the only thing that can happen with your work is that it gets better, it will never get worse. That is the turning point for most of them. Except for Africa people who really find a lot right with what can happen with their work.",

How easy or hard have you found it to engage with new people that you want to get involved with this when it comes down to these small differences? Have you found people react badly when they're given these choices or is it small differences of opinion, or do they get involved in these discussions? Does it attract them more or is it off putting?

        "ANSWER": "I think that the scientific enterprise is very competitive in the USA in the UK and in Europe but also in Africa and in Africa there is another factor that adds to this and that is they have a slight inferiority complex more or less that everything they do is perhaps not as worthy as what other people in the northern universities in the USA, UK or Europe. So if they have something that they think is great they are very reluctant to put these ideas somewhere in an open access journal because they have the feeling that they loose things. That if they give something away it's very bad for their self esteem. I can understand it completely and of course it has something to do with their jobs. If people who give them a job or who are in charge of putting them for another job in the next few years are looking at what they have published in closed access journals then of course they will be very afraid that they have missed the boat more or less. But if these people of the universities could look at the impact of the work that their employees have in the world. As they would look at old metrics and not if it's in nature or science, then they would gain a lot of points because you could see the impact they had is because of their work and not because of where it's published and that could also break the spell between protecting my things that i did myself and sharing it with other scientists in the world.",

When you are working with people in Africa, is the reluctance down to, is it harder to make a living for scientists there, what makes it harder there in your experience for the people there to accept that kind of argument?",

        "ANSWER": "For the next time that i am directly involved in open access journals as an advisor but i also do work in separating open access spectrum method of the public library of science and the point is that we really want to have people seeing what kind of rights they have if they read some works that are listed in a journal and it's a very easy way if you can quantify say the open access list of an article or of a journal and that is what we try to do in the collaboration with the public library of science, Cottage Labs, direct of open access journals and we did a pilot project just finished that did rather good research i think. So what i hope to do is a full implementation of this OAS of open exospectrum methods in the direct of open access journals as of July or something and apart from that what i hope to do is make open access work more accessible by organising it better according to topics and also making it more accessible by being able to say how good some work is because if you are a scientist and you want to know something then you go to for example a place where you can find information ideally and ideally all the information is there, then you find the information that you want and you make sure that it's open access and you can do anything with it that you want and for that you really need to be able to know to get it open access in the sense that you need it. Plus you need to know that the work, the articles, the information you're seeking is available in this location and that you don't have to start searching for half a year all over the world because they missed something. So it's a question of organizing databases with open access information as full, as complete as possible and of assessing the quality of the information that people can make the choice of the best sources of the information that they need and those two aspects of organizing databases and communities and organizing the assessment of the quality can be interlinked because if you have a group of people that are in need of some information because they work in that field, then they can also judge how good the information is, as long as the assurance that the information is there is also complete. Those two projects i hope to do together with the Open Knowledge Foundation in the Open Science Development Group and in collaboration with a network platform for scientists which is called Science Open. That's a new organization in Berlin and what they want is to have scientists that visit the site that know them. They have all the information they have in open access there to be discussed, to be judged, to be assessed, to be used for collaboration etc etc. So i think that the Science Open platform offers a lot of possibilities for me to go after these ideals and i think that they are ideals that i just talk are also shared by the founders of that site in the open platform. So that is the plan for the next few years.",

That i want things to be this way because i think it's better for the world and for the science, for the health of the population in the world etc. But on the other hand of course i want to do the work to support myself to a certain extent. So I'm looking for projects that are not completely free of some renumeration and it shouldn't be of course projects where i can earn tons of Euros or Dollars or whatever. But what i found with Science Open and directive open access journals and in itself those organizations may not have enough money to pay consultants but there are funders who may be interested in the ideas i talked about and that can just support the deal and support science open in certain aspects and they can support me indirectly in that sense.",
